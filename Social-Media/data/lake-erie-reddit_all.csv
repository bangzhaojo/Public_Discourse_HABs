The company, Tribar, of Wixom, has been repeatedly responsible for several spill events in which they contaminated the Huron River from Wixom all the way down through Ann Arbor and into and including Lake Erie.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;By the 1960s, Lake Erie had become sort of a ""poster child"" for water pollution. Pollutants from factories, waste from city sewers, and fertilizer and pesticides from farms made their way to the lake, according to Cleveland Historical. As a result, levels of phosphorus and nitrogen increased, which led to algae blooms. The toxic algae caused ""dead zones"" by depleting the oxygen, and dead fish littered the shoreline. And in 1969, the Cuyahoga River, which flows through Cleveland, Ohio, caught fire.

&gt; (Bloomberg) -- Lake Erie Energy Development Corp. may resume its long-stalled efforts to build the first offshore wind project in the US Great Lakes after the Ohio Supreme Court rejected a challenge to its permit.  

&gt; The Cleveland-based company can construct six turbines in Lake Erie, the court ruled Wednesday, upholding the permit issued in 2020 by the Ohio Power Siting Board. The $127 million Icebreaker project would have about 21 megawatts of capacity and is intended to demonstrate the viability of offshore wind farms in the Great Lakes. 

&gt; Wind and solar have struggled to gain traction in Ohio, where renewables supplied about 2% of the state’s energy in 2020. The Icebreaker project faced pushback from local residents and the now-bankrupt coal producer Murray Energy Corp., which asserted that the board had failed to adequately consider the project’s potential impact on wildlife. The court rejected those claims.

This could be cool for humans, since the Great Lakes Region will likely be one of the few comfortably habitable places in the US as climate change proceeds.

Sadly, however, our local ecology could hugely suffer from this.

More deer and other wild critters turning up with parasites (sorry, hunters and lovers of venison). 

The ecology of Lake Erie will probably go even more topsy-turvy than it already is.

When we get out over them with my father and I, the bottom of the fish finder above the ground level looks like it's scanning aquatic plant life, it's thousands of walleye.

Even with charter boats taking fish out of the lake like that it's hardly a dent.  But once the commercial trot lines start yanking them up 100 at a time all day long it's over.

When I was in highschool in the 00s you could drop a crappie rig with 2 minnows down to the bottom and pull up 2 pearch, the limit was 50 a person and you'd clear the limit for a whole boat of people in an hour.  That's not the case anymore unless you go deep.",0

My only comment is that I understand most of that soluble nitrogen gets washed away from usable farmland, into water bodies as a pollutant often triggering things like Lake Erie toxic algea blooms. Eventually this dies and falls to the bottom layers and is effectively no longer contributing to the cycle  or carrying capacity.

Phosphorous is similar in that human waste and sanitation dumps the resource in a similar way. There was research on extracting key nutrients for reuse, but I don't think its been commercialized.

The ""easy"" solution of composting biological waste to be repurposed as fertilizer and keeping it as usable terrestrial sources has consequences of magnifying feedback loops of unwanted contaminants like pharmaceuticals, hormone disruptors, heavy metals, and now PFAS and microplastics.

I would check the water quality before letting them get in. Lake Erie is not really a swimming lake. You can swim in it, but it’s not recommended.

[2014 Watershed Management Plan Upper Chestatee Watershed](https://epd.georgia.gov/document/document/chestatee-river/download)

Fecal coliform data from 2002-2003

On 6/5/2002 the Fecal Coliform level spiked to 16000. The report doesn't mention why the level spiked. Google shows 6/5 as National Moonshine Day.

&gt;This segment of the river was listed on the Georgia 303 (d) list of impaired water bodies due to high fecal coliform readings obtained during sampling events in 2002 and 2003.  
&gt;  
&gt;Based on the preliminary review of land use and development, suggested possible causes of increased levels of fecal coliform into the river include: human waste from sewage leaks or septic tank leaks, development activities, logging activities, domestic animals, urban wildlife, livestock, or rural wildlife.  
&gt;  
&gt;The upper Chestatee River watershed does not have access to any public sewer and limited access to public water. All of the properties within the watershed rely on a septic system of some kind.  
&gt;  
&gt;The upper Chestatee River watershed targeted here has been identified as impaired with regard to fecal colioform bacterial levels permissible under the standards for streams with a designated use of Fishing. A stream is placed on this list if more than 10% of the samples exceed the fecal coliform criteria.",0

I was raised in Salem and never allowed to play in the river because it was always greenish (which is a sign of algae). The Simpsons' three eyed fish jokes and such were based on the Willamette as Matt Groening grew up in Eugene/Springfield and the Willamette there was also off limits. 
 I visited Riverfront two weeks ago, it was still greenish and had beer cans floating at the dock near the old wheelboat. I wouldn't drink it, definitely wouldn't pay the possible 600-900 bucks of a triathlon fee to swim in it. 

So here's some news from recently (as in 2022 recently) and know that I absolutely think the Ironman Triathlon would charge people several hundred dollars to swim in garbage water, especially because they probably only look at Portland statistics and not Salem ones.

Of the big lake they called Gitche Gumee
The lake, it is said, never gives up her dead
When the skies of November turn gloomy
With a load of iron ore twenty-six thousand tons more
Than the Edmund Fitzgerald weighed empty
That good ship and true was a bone to be chewed
When the gales of November came early
The ship was the pride of the American side
Coming back from some mill in Wisconsin
As the big freighters go, it was bigger than most
With a crew and good captain well seasoned
Concluding some terms with a couple of steel firms
When they left fully loaded for Cleveland
And later that night when the ship's bell rang
Could it be the north wind they'd been feelin'?
The wind in the wires made a tattle-tale sound
And a wave broke over the railing
And every man knew, as the captain did too
T'was the witch of November come stealin'
The dawn came late and the breakfast had to wait
When the gales of November came slashin'
When afternoon came it was freezin' rain
In the face of a hurricane west wind
When suppertime came, the old cook came on deck sayin'
""Fellas, it's too rough to feed ya""
At seven PM, a main hatchway caved in, he said
""Fellas, it's been good to know ya""
The captain wired in he had water comin' in
And the good ship and crew was in peril
And later that night when his lights went outta sight
Came the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald
Does any one know where the love of God goes
When the waves turn the minutes to hours?
The searchers all say they'd have made Whitefish Bay
If they'd put fifteen more miles behind her
They might have split up or they might have capsized
They may have broke deep and took water
And all that remains is the faces and the names
Of the wives and the sons and the daughters

And farther below Lake Ontario
Takes in what Lake Erie can send her
And the iron boats go as the mariners all know

In a musty old hall in Detroit they prayed
In the maritime sailors' cathedral
The church bell chimed 'til it rang twenty-nine times
For each man on the Edmund Fitzgerald
The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down
Of the big lake they called Gitche Gumee

&gt;Balloonfest '86 was a 1986 event in Cleveland, Ohio, United States, in which the local chapter of United Way set a world record by releasing almost 1.5 million balloons.[2] The event was intended to be a harmless fundraising publicity stunt, but the balloons drifted back over the city, Lake Erie, and landed in the surrounding area, causing problems for traffic and a nearby airport. The event also interfered with a United States Coast Guard search for two boaters who were later found drowned.[1] In consequence, the organizers and the city faced lawsuits seeking millions of dollars in damages,[1] and cost overruns put the event at a net loss.[3]

&gt;Typically, a helium-filled latex balloon that is released outdoors will stay aloft long enough to be fully deflated before it descends to Earth.[6] However, the Balloonfest balloons collided with a front of cool air and rain and dropped towards the ground, still inflated, clogging the land and waterways of Northeast Ohio. In the days following the event, many balloons were reported washed ashore on the Canadian side of Lake Erie causing water pollution.[5]

&gt;Two fishermen, Raymond Broderick and Bernard Sulzer, who had gone out on September 26, were reported missing by their families on the day of the event. Rescuers spotted their 16-foot (4.9 m) boat anchored west of the Edgewater Park breakwall. A Coast Guard search and rescue helicopter crew had difficulties reaching the area because of the ""asteroid field"" of balloons.[7] A search-and-rescue boat crew tried to spot the fishermen floating in the lake, but Guard officials said balloons in the water made it impossible to see whether anyone was in the lake.[1] On September 29, the Coast Guard suspended its search. The fishermen's bodies subsequently washed ashore. The wife of one of the fishermen sued the United Way of Cleveland and the company that organized the balloon release for $3.2 million and later settled on undisclosed terms.[1]

&gt;Balloons landing on a pasture in Medina County, Ohio, spooked Louise Nowakowski's Arabian horses, which allegedly suffered permanent injuries as a result. Nowakowski sued the United Way of Cleveland for $100,000 in damages and settled for undisclosed terms.[1]

&gt;Burke Lakefront Airport had to shut down a runway for half an hour after balloons landed there.[1][3] Traffic collisions were also reported ""as drivers swerved to avoid slow motion blizzards of multicolored orbs or took their eyes off the road to gawk at the overhead spectacle"".[3]

&gt;The 1988 copy of The Guinness Book of World Records recognizes the event as a world record ""largest ever mass balloon release"", with 1,429,643 balloons launched.[8][9] Because of the damage caused, Guinness no longer measures environmentally unsound events like balloon releases.",1

I’m also interested because I’m pretty sure there is an algae bloom on Lake Erie near Monroe right now. Fish flies aka mayflies from the order Ephemeroptera (pretty sure genus is Hexagenia for these swarms) live in the lake bottom (aka benthos) as nymphs for up to 2 years before emerging as the winged adults that you see on land. They burrow in the soft sediments and are and indicator of good water quality. They feed on detritus, or decomposing bits that fall to the lake bottom. In some parts of the Great Lakes, these mayfly swarms don’t happen anymore due to pollution and human altered habitat. The emerging adults provide abundant food for fish. If they make out of the water, they’ll mate, lay eggs on the water, then die. 

A lot of other common summer insects have similar life cycles - dragonflies and damselflies spend most of their life cycle as aquatic nymphs as well. Dragonfly nymphs are fierce predators - there’s some pretty cool YouTube videos of them eating small minnows and other bugs that live on the bottom of the water column (aka benthic invertebrates).",2

There are 7.5 billion people on Earth. The urinary bladder can store up to 500 ml of urine in women and 700 ml in men (generally speaking).

To make this easier, I am using the 700 ml figure instead of figuring out averages by gender and also taking into account different bladder sizes belonging to children and babies.

If all 7.5 billion people peed an entire bladder of urine at the same time, that would amount to 5.25 trillion liters of urine.

The volume of the smallest ocean, the Arctic Ocean, (if we're talking ocean basins) is 18,750,000 cubic km. Our cumulative urine would fill .00525 cubic km.

If we're using the smallest sea, the Baltic sea has 20,900 cubic km of volume or 3,980,952.38 larger area.

Even the smallest of the five Great Lakes, Lake Erie, is over 91,428.57 times larger with 480 cubic km.

Again, I'm not taking into account true bladder sizes (and that we don't need to pee when they are completely full but start to need to pee around a third to half fullness), and I'm also using basins and seas, as the global ocean is actually considered one large body (not going to even try to go into those numbers since they're too big to relate to).

If you examine highs similarly, you realize that Ohio winters now are punctuated with thaws and highs above freezing, sometimes well above freezing.  This results in much lower snow accumulations.

What's extraordinarily important, and not understood by Ohioans, Americans, and certainly not by our politicians based on their public comments, warming will accelerate even more rapidly going forward barring a rapid transition away from fossil fuel consumption.  Natural feedback loops, such the thawing of the North American permafrost releasing massive amounts of greenhouse gases, have the potential to overwhelm the environment.

Arctic Amplification more directly impacts Ohio, as every year there is simply less Arctic cold air available to reach down into Ohio.

Still not really convinced this is the way to go. 

The great lakes have significant engineering challenges, the great lakes are typically too deep where wind is the strongest and most constant for energy capture, which means that they need to leverage floating wind turbine platforms, not fixed-bottom. 

Wind turbines have focused on Ohio specifically because Lake Erie is the shallowest of the great lakes, which enables them to use fixed bottom turbines. All of the other great lakes are too deep for fixed bottom turbines which means that they would need to use floating turbine platforms.

Floating turbines have significant engineering hurdles with freshwater lakes, largely the formation of the huge ice sheets and ice floes over the great lakes.",0

Raw material production of most kinds produces a lot of waste, and production of metal from ore is the same.  In *modern* steelmaking, about 1/2 of slag is produced for every 1 ton of iron.  Modern industry tries to find a beneficial and moneymaking reuse for these materials, and modern slag is used for making cement, glass fibers, agricultural soil treatments, aggregate, and other things.  Most of it gets reused today.  But the ratio of slag to steel production was higher back then, and the reuse was limited.  High supply, low demand...an iron furnace could soon be drowning in its own slag if it were not dumped or dispersed far away from the mill.  Most larger towns had a mill of some kind, outside of town, and slag would be dumped around the mill for as long as possible.  It was also given away just to get rid of it, and was hauled away and used road and railroad base, it was used to fill in low areas for construction and development, it was just dumped down riverbanks and into stream beds and the ocean, and to make dikes and levees, and it was used as landfill to fill in ocean bays and the bays in the Great Lakes.  In 1969, Bethlehem Steel received permits from the US and local govt's to dump 1.5 MILLION TONS of slag per year into Lake Erie at their facility in Lackawanna NY.  A lot of that is still there, and there is a whole valley filled with it in Bethlehem, PA.

And it shows the upstream communities like Edina and St. Louis park that Minneapolis is willing to do its part. Why should we expect them to make efforts if we will not?

And I would ask you the same question I would of any golf supporter: if you want the water quality to improve what is your plan? Where would you restore or install wetlands to do that upstream? What evidence do you have that whatever location you have in mind would be a more effective spot than at Hiawatha, or be more politically feasible?

Also: how can you argue that it will not improve _trash_ pollution at the lake when currently there is a pipe that delivers enormous quantities of trash direct from the streets of our city to the lake, and with the plan there will be a sizable catchment area where this trash can settle, floc, and/or be filtered? How is that not a significant improvement?

And regarding money: the site is within the Nokomis-Hiawatha Regional park and as such will qualify for regional park and water quality dollars from the Met Council and possibly the state.

Cleveland is a perfect example.  They're currently building their own deep tunnel system that has a goal of reducing the amount of untreated water released to under a half billion gallons per year.  That's a significant reduction from the 4.5 billion gallons that they have been releasing, and similar in nature to what Milwaukee's deep tunnel project has achieved.  


&gt;During the 1970s, an estimated nine billion gallons of untreated water would flow into Lake Erie during heavy rains, and even though they were able to reduce that to 4.5 billion gallons, Cleveland was still found to be in violation of the Federal Clean Water Act and was mandated to come up with a solution. Project Clean Lake will eventually take that to under a half billion gallons a year.

Of the big lake they called Gitche Gumee
The lake, it is said, never gives up her dead
When the skies of November turn gloomy
With a load of iron ore twenty-six thousand tons more
Than the Edmund Fitzgerald weighed empty
That good ship and true was a bone to be chewed
When the gales of November came early

The ship was the pride of the American side
Coming back from some mill in Wisconsin
As the big freighters go, it was bigger than most
With a crew and good captain well seasoned
Concluding some terms with a couple of steel firms
When they left fully loaded for Cleveland
And later that night when the ship's bell rang
Could it be the north wind they'd been feelin'?

The wind in the wires made a tattle-tale sound
And a wave broke over the railing
And every man knew, as the captain did too
T'was the witch of November come stealin'
The dawn came late and the breakfast had to wait
When the gales of November came slashin'
When afternoon came it was freezin' rain
In the face of a hurricane west wind

When suppertime came, the old cook came on deck sayin'
""Fellas, it's too rough to feed ya""
At seven PM, a main hatchway caved in, he said
""Fellas, it's been good to know ya""
The captain wired in he had water comin' in
And the good ship and crew was in peril
And later that night when his lights went outta sight
Came the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald

Does any one know where the love of God goes
When the waves turn the minutes to hours?
The searchers all say they'd have made Whitefish Bay
If they'd put fifteen more miles behind her
They might have split up or they might have capsized
They may have broke deep and took water
And all that remains is the faces and the names
Of the wives and the sons and the daughters

Lake Huron rolls, Superior sings
In the rooms of her ice-water mansion
Old Michigan steams like a young man's dreams
The islands and bays are for sportsmen
And farther below Lake Ontario
Takes in what Lake Erie can send her
And the iron boats go as the mariners all know
With the gales of November remembered

In a musty old hall in Detroit they prayed
In the maritime sailors' cathedral
The church bell chimed 'til it rang twenty-nine times
For each man on the Edmund Fitzgerald
The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down
Of the big lake they called Gitche Gumee
Superior, they said, never gives up her dead

t1_ioy6c4o,Michigan,2022-09,2022-09-18 17:07:23,1,B,"With loving respect, having spent years in Purdue's  College of Ag, no one is suppressing cover crops. 

It is a continuously promoted. As is proper crop rotation, alt drainage strategies, and no and reduced tillage, and residue resupply.

In FACT, the recent euthropication problems in Lake Erie are do to so many Ohio farmers adopted no till ag.

See, in fresh water systems, Phosphorous is normally the limiting nutrient. (In salt water systems like the Gulf of Mexico, it's nitrogen). But phosphorous is normally spread as a solid, and it needs close soil contact to become fixed. But no till helps build up a layer of plant matter on the surface. This plant matter is generally great, supporting soil carbon, microbial and soil fauna, and helping retain moisture. But if the P fertilizer falls on it, it won't fix to the soil. Then rain can carry it down to water.

So wholesale promotion of no till without modifying P fertilization strategies caused the eutrophication. Spreading news of incorporation needs has helped reduce that algae problem in Erie while maintaining the benefits of no till farming (to soil carbon. Of course pesticide use generally goes way up in no till). 

Point is: the extensions go fucking hard on no till, CC, carbon amendments, and high precision fertilizer application. All of this is regenerative ag, which usually an undefined term to mean ""whatever strategies I prefer"".",1

From the Erie County Parks Master Plan:

Chestnut Ridge Park is one of the original Erie County 
Parks, beginning its development in 1926. Much of the 
park construction was handled through the WPA work 
force through the 1930s; this consisted of shelters, pump 
shelters, colony ovens, and pavilions. The most significant 
and prominent structure was and is the Casino, a stone 
building sitting atop a hill overlooking the surrounding park 
and community. The original timber Casino was built in 
1925, and destroyed by fire in 1932. The present day stone 
Casino was completed in 1938 by nearly 50 employees of 
the WPA. The use of stone in the construction of the park 
during the days of the WPA provided its structures with a 
rustic feel. The flagstone area behind the building allows 
park users to gaze upon marvelous views out towards 
Buffalo and even far out beyond Lake Erie to Canada. 
The design of bridges and cabins blended into the 
natural beauty of the park and 3.5 miles of roads were 
constructed to allow access to the natural areas of the 
park. The diversified forest provides many habitats to 
wildlife and opportunities for relief from urban living.

Still enough population to form mutual aid networks, but not so much that things might get violent and hostile between major population centers in a collapse. The coastal area around Lake Erie in Ohio is heavily populated, to the point where I would be wary of SHTF situations happening the minute people start panicking.  
I'm anticipating access to freshwater being one of the top concerns in a future collapse + climate change situation, and northern Michigan is fully surrounded by two huge Great Lakes (Michigan and Huron) both of which have better water quality than Erie.

Voters got a chance to hear directly from the two candidates for Ohio House District 41 as Democrat Nancy Larson and Republican Josh Williams faced off Wednesday in a debate that highlighted far more differences than similarities.

The debate, hosted by WTVG-TV, Channel 13 and The Blade at the station’s studio, saw the candidates address hot-button topics such as crime and abortion, as well as their plans for finding solutions to local-level issues. They include protecting Lake Erie and how to spend the state’s pool of American Rescue Act funding.

Ms. Larson, a social worker from Sylvania, said that she feels the outcome of the election will determine “whether we have more or less freedom when it's over.” She added that the work she has done through 40 years in the field has allowed her to help “thousands” of people during her career.

Mr. Williams, a criminal defense attorney and Oregon resident, said in his opening statement that he wants to “make it easier for every single motivated Ohioan to dig themselves out of the circumstances and grow to their true potential.”

He described his own story of going from a high school dropout and being disabled from a work accident to becoming a college graduate and a practicing attorney.

The 41st House District was put in place as a part of the state’s recent redistricting process. It stretches from Richfield Township to Jerusalem Township, encompassing Sylvania, Oregon, and parts of North Toledo, including Point Place, along the way.

Whitmer High School is not in the candidates’ district, but part of Washington Local School District is in the district. Both candidates addressed how they want to lower crime in the community in the wake of Friday’s shooting outside a football game at Whitmer. Three people were wounded. 

Ms. Larson argued for more “sensible” gun laws and a focus on funding for afterschool programs and community policing.

Mr. Williams said that the solution lies within ensuring that the state “properly funds the police” and considering stricter penalties for violent offenders. They include a “10-year minimum” gun specification “for the use of guns in violent crimes.”

On the issue of police reform, both candidates agreed that qualified immunity should be removed. Qualified immunity is when officers are “immune from civil liability when they act outside the bounds of their authority,” Mr. Williams said.

When the topic of abortion was addressed, the candidates differed greatly. Ms. Larson said that she wants to return to the abortion protections that were allowed by Roe vs. Wade.

Mr. Williams argued that the GOP-backed “heartbeat bill” would still allow for abortions for up to six weeks. He added that he would support abortion exceptions for pregnancies that threaten the life of the mother.

Ohio has to find a way to spend more than $5 billion in American Rescue Plan Act funding for continued recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. Both candidates hope to find a way to maximize northwest Ohio’s share of that fund, if elected.

Mr. Williams said that he wants to see the money go toward “job creation and workforce development,” and an expansion of job training programs. Ms. Larson wants to see more funding for the University of Toledo, establishing a community college in downtown Toledo, and investing further in clean energy development.

During the hour-long debate, the pair also sparred over how to best protect one of the region's most important natural resources in Lake Erie. Both have differences in what they believe is the root cause of what pollutes the lake.

Ms. Larson said that the state needs to stop permitting “concentrated animal farms” and look into disbanding existing farms that dump waste into Lake Erie.

“The land can handle so much waste, and it needs to be farmed appropriately,” she said.

Mr. Williams believes that the problem lies within municipalities not being held accountable for dumping their wastewater into the lake.

“The solution is not to ban pigs,” Mr. Williams said. “It's about how we hold cities accountable for the untreated sewage their dumping into our rivers and lakes.”

In closing statements, Ms. Larson said that she believes that she is “on the side of democracy” in her positions.

“Sometimes leaders do what they know is the right thing to do, even if others don’t yet see it,” she said. “Most of the time though, leaders can and should listen to the will of the people because it's a reliable guide to what will turn out best for all of us. I have the work experience, the wisdom, and the empathy to do this job in that way.”

Mr. Williams believes that his personal experience makes him a candidate who can bring about unique solutions for the district and the state.

“The solution is not just to have empathy for everyone because of their life experiences,” he said in his closing statement. “It’s using your life experience to help guide Ohioans to a better future.”

The time of night and the bright lights of the stadium attracted the midges to the playing field.

Edit: I just grabbed my copy of the book

Verducci writes that midges had disappeared from the polluted Lake Erie, but after extensive clean up efforts there and in the Cuyahoga River, they began to return.  Midges only really swarm a few days a year in early May - June, but October 5th 2007 was unusually warm in Cleveland, so that triggered another swarm.  They gathered around the artificial light of the stadium, and descended on the playing field.  The play time of the game was adjusted to accommodate the Red Sox/Angels game, and that ended up putting the 8th inning of Game 2 right smack in the middle of the swarm.

t1_ists4ge,ExplainBothSides,2022-10,2022-10-18 17:22:07,1,C,"# Leftist perspective

Leftists want our economy to explicitly serve the people in our society and to be deliberately engineered to improve people's outcomes and freedoms.

Voting Republican will destroy the fragile web of regulations that prevent things from getting much worse fast. For just one example, the EPA was created after unrestrained capitalism regularly set fire to major rivers and Lake Erie. [Trump tried to gut it.](https://theweek.com/articles/816875/how-trump-redefining-epa)

Leftists generally want everyone to have a baseline guaranteed quality of life. Republicans since Reagan [have worked to remove or limit welfare programs.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1984/07/29/reagan-welfare-cuts-found-to-worsen-families-poverty/077278f9-a875-4791-9c34-d1cf3cd148b5/) Welfare programs are no more than gauze on an arterial bleed, but they're better than nothing.

Democrats, however, are often in favor of maintaining, or occasionally improving, these inadequate bandage policies. Voting Democrat is a matter of harm reduction. It's nowhere near all that leftists want to do, but if voting doesn't require obscene amounts of effort, it's pretty effective at slowing the rate of going-to-hell.

However, Democrats cannot be trusted to enact a leftist agenda, or even make a token gesture toward leftism.

# Liberal perspective

Economically, a liberal is someone who supports capitalism. Socially, a liberal is someone who supports people doing what they want with their lives.

From the economic perspective, you might vote Democrat because the businesses you support aren't negatively impacted by current and likely future regulations, at least not more than they're helped. Those who take a broader view of the economy would generally agree that, for instance, forbidding people from dumping used motor oil into the Ohio River is a bit of a burden on those who need to dump used motor oil, but it's more than offset by having the Ohio River not catch fire every year.

You might also vote Democrat because you think a few people temporarily need assistance when they're down on their luck, but most everyone can and should participate in capitalism, and that should be the goal of assistance programs.

You could also vote Democrat because, while you prefer further right economic policies, you are against bigotry and think the government has a place in protecting against it, like with affirmative action — or at least that it should abstain from enforcing it, such as with transgender healthcare bans. Or because you believe that people should not be forced to give up their health due to pregnancy and should be able to obtain an abortion.

You might also vote Democrat because the only other viable alternative is a Republican and that Republican is a child rapist or the like. This has happened in some elections. Democrats are generally quick to remove or disavow politicians who have been credibly accused of serious misconduct, but Republicans seem unmoved by such accusations.

# Right-wing perspective

Technically, this is the *further* right wing perspective economically.

You might vote Republican because you view taxes and government programs as an imposition on your freedom. Government, you say, should exist for a minimal set of purposes, and it's taken on a large set of other responsibilities that should instead exist as different kinds of entity. This is an economically libertarian view.

You might also vote Republican because of bigotry. Republicans want to dismantle affirmative action and marriage equality. They support religious organizations being used for things like adoption and supporting homeless people, even when these religious organizations discriminate against people on the basis of religion or sexuality or the like. They have been legislating against transgender rights such as getting gender-affirming healthcare. They're keen on enacting laws to ban single digit numbers of trans children from participating in middle and high school sports. They use openly racist rhetoric, like strongly implying that Mexican immigrants are rapists and murderers.

Or you might like the strong man rhetoric that Republicans use.",0

NUISANCE SPECIES: MUTE SWANS

Mute swans are commonly seen on large public lakes and are widespread throughout Ohio. They are considered a non-native invasive species in the United States and are becoming a nuisance here in Ohio. There are three species of swans that can be found in Ohio: The native trumpeter swan, tundra swan (or whistling swan, which only migrates through Ohio) and the mute swan. Mute swans will outcompete with the threatened trumpeter swan on Lake Erie marshes and other locations for nesting habitat.

During the breeding and nesting season, which generally runs March through May, adult mute swans become highly territorial and will fight to push native birds out of their nesting area. Mute swans have been known to attack humans and pets during this time as well. This aggressive behavior also occurs after the young, called cygnets, hatch out. On public lakes, people who use jet-skis and kayaks tend to get flogged by swans if they get too close to their nest or young. The adult male will fly after what they see as a predator to chase it away and use their wings to attack. They have been known to drown people on rare occasions.   

An adult male swan can weigh up to twenty-six pounds and stand as tall as five feet. Mute swans can consume up to eight pounds of submerged aquatic vegetation in one day. They uproot the whole plant usually leaving nothing behind. This takes away natural habitat from fish and leaves little food source for native waterfowl. The removal of aquatic vegetation can also cause water quality issues and erosion problems. 

The Division of Wildlife controls mute swans on public lands by utilizing egg addling to cut back on production and by physical removal of adult birds. Occasionally, complaints are received from homeowners who surround public lakes when mute swans are being aggressive. Removal of the bird is the action taken when human safety is a factor.  

Contrary to what most people believe, mute swans will nest next to Canada geese. Homeowner associations or golf courses will purchase swans for goose control. Ultimately the swans will eventually become a problem for the homeowners around the ponds because of aggression issues and removal is warranted. We encourage private landowners who chose to have mute swans to keep them controlled. The ways to control them is to only purchase one swan or two of the same sex and keep their wings clipped or pinioned. This will keep the swan on the owner’s property. Landowners can also addle the eggs so cygnets do not hatch out. If the young are going to be allowed to hatch out, their wings need to be clipped or pinioned as well so they cannot leave the property. Division staff will assist private landowners who ask for removal of mutes by giving technical assistance or removing the swans depending on site-specific circumstances.",0

Around here 
Early commercial fisherman (pre-1850) perceived lake sturgeon as a nuisance fish because of fishing gear destruction. This led to their wide-spread slaughter.
In Ontario at Amherstburg, the oily fish were stacked like firewood and left to dry. The mummified bodies were burned to heat the boilers of wood-burning steamboats on the Detroit River.
by the late 1900's, 80% of the lake sturgeon were removed from Lake Erie.
Female lake sturgeon spawn once every 4 to 9 years while males spawn every 2 to 7 years.
Sexual maturity in females is reached most often around 24-26 years.
The typical life-span of lake sturgeon is 55 years for males and 80-150 years for females.
As a consequence of interrupted spawning cycles, only 10-20% of adult lake sturgeon within a population are sexually active and spawn during a given season.

The event took place on September 27, 1986, and was intended to be a harmless fundraising publicity stunt, but the balloons drifted back over the city, Lake Erie, and landed in the surrounding area, causing problems for traffic and a nearby airport. The event also interfered with a United States Coast Guard search for two boaters who were later found drowned.

Funny thing is at least for like Lake Erie, there's still limits on how many fish you should eat from there in a given time to be safe.  Depends on the type of fish, and what the fish eats.  Perch is okay twice a week, walleye over a week, some fish like catfish and other bottom feeders they recommend no more than once a month or every other month.  And some places, like parts of the Ohio river they still recommend eating zero fish.

Cleveland can have a claim to being a pretty dope town with the rock and roll hall of fame and the sports franchises but our ancestors have decided that the health of our state citizens and all the land didn’t matter and used the watersheds as their industrial toilet.

We’ve released the most balloons in the world at one time and basically told the environment a big fuck you and also resulted in at least one death I can remember but it might’ve been more.

&gt;The plan area lies on moderate to steep slopes

&gt;and on the flood plain of the Russian River

&gt;The town of Guerneville lies less than one mile to the north of the plan area,
across the Russian River, and the community of Vacation Beach sits at the foot of
Neeley Hill, directly downslope of proposed timber operations

&gt;Water bodies in the Russian River watershed are listed under the Clean Water Act Section 303(d) (per the 2012 List) due to impairments to water quality by several pollutants

&gt;The entire Russian River watershed is impaired for sediment and temperature. Recent
data show a pathogen impairment throughout the watershed, as well.

&gt;In 2004, the Regional Water Board adopted a Sediment TMDL Implementation Policy
(Resolution Rl-2004-0087), which states that Regional Water Board staff shall
control sediment pollution by using existing permitting and enforcement tools.  The
goals of the Policy are to control sediment waste discharges to impaired water bodies
so that the TMDLs are met, sediment water quality objectives are attained, and
beneficial uses are no longer impaired by sediment.

&gt; Sediment
conditions interact with water in many ways that can affect water temperatures.
Therefore, practices implemented to prevent and minimize elevated sediment
discharges may also help control elevated water temperatures.

&gt;potential discharges of treated wastewater

&gt;During the PHI, RWB staff observed a road fill failure and associated debris slide. The
failure occurred on a permanent road constructed on an ~85% slope above a Class III
watercourse, extending about seven feet into the old road prism and narrowing the road
to less than seven feet in width. The failure is approximately 75 feet wide, 40 feet long
and 4 to 8 feet deep (Fig 1.) Sediment and debris from the failure entered the Class III
watercourse at the foot of the slope,

&gt; All of these sites and other sites throughout the plan area were littered with
trash, some of which may contain toxic substances. RWB staff observed one small (~5
gallon) tank of refrigerant and numerous camping gas tanks. Several of these sites were
situated in the channels of Class II and III watercourses.

&gt;There are two potential issues of concern with respect to
the irrigation lines; one is the potential for impacts to slope stability by removal of trees
on saturated vulnerable ground and the other is impacts to the districts disposal process
if a line is damaged.

&gt;During the first review process, CDFW brought to attention discrepancies in Section II, Item 32(a) of the
THP regarding northern spotted owl protections. The habitat definitions and retention standards
described appeared to be from Attachment B instead of Attachment A, which contains the take
avoidance measures for northern spotted owls in the coast forest district. In the RPF response to first
review, the definitions and retention standards were not corrected, and Attachment B was referenced
near the beginning of Item 32 within the northern spotted owl protections.
CDFW recommends in Section II, Item 32(a), the protection measures for NSO be revised to reflect the
definitions and retention standards for Attachment A, the November 1,2019 revision. Justification: The
take avoidance measures should reference the appropriate ecotype, allowing the review team to
evaluate the proposed measures for NSO take avoidance.

&gt;During the first review process and through a Northern Spotted Owl (NSO) consultation, CDFW brought
to attention concerns with the timing and stations of the NSO surveys that may affect the quality of the
survey data, resulting in a possible false negative finding. The RPF agreed to supplement the survey effort with three additional surveys in 2020 conducted as close as possible to the crepuscular hours and
one additional thorough Stand Search of the THP area. Efforts to obtain NSO survey information from
past THPs on the property were ongoing at the time of the PHI, and the RPF was able to provide eight
years of NSO survey data from a neighboring NTMP during first review. The additional survey efforts
and any past survey data will allow CDFW to make a higher confidence determination regarding take
avoidance


&gt;Page 79, #6 states “For NSO AC’s where fledgling status has been determined (either nest failure
or fledglings have left the core area).” How will you determine that fledglings have left the core
area? This section does not appear to be from the newly revised Attachment A (2019). Should
the 1st sentence instead state “For any NSO activity center, regardless of current nesting
status:”? Please review for consistency.

&gt;THP does not appear to address this nest in the protection measures section for osprey.  Additionally, this nest should be included on the operations map.  

&gt;The THP does not include
language defining the dates of the critical period during which no timber operations are
permitted, with few exceptions. Please include language defining the dates of the critical
period for Northern Goshawk.

&gt;“A daytime stand search was conducted
within the property and off the property in the vicinity of the SON0076 AC looking for
evidence of NSOs on 25APR18, 22APR19 and 09MAR20, and no NSO’s were found.” Were
these stand searches conducted to protocol standards, specifically a thorough survey of
the entire THP area searching for NSO whitewash, pellets, and feathers while
broadcasting vocalizations, listening for responses, and watching for owls silently flying
in? Please provide a map of the search routes along with data forms that include start
and end times and description of the habitat.

First off, fuck Trump for using this to score cheap political points. At least 40 people have been discovered to have died due to this storm so far.  

Second, Buffalo sits at the eastern edge of Lake Erie and is right in the path of what's called [a lake-effect snow band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake-effect_snow?wprov=sfla1). 

Long story short, when the cold, dry wind blows across the still relatively warm lake water, water is sucked up into the atmosphere like a sponge. When the wind then blows across the higher elevations in the Buffalo region, the moisture is essentially squeezed out as a metric shit ton of snow. 

Our main respite from lake-effect snow comes in the form of Lake Erie eventually freezing over towards the middle to end of the winter. Since winters are becoming generally milder due to climate change, we're not getting that freezing. 

So not only is Trump generally a moron about most stuff, but he's also wrong about this. Global warming, so to speak, is indeed fuelling these storms, and is going to make them worse.",0

Lake Erie not being frozen because of climate change leads to unusual weather events.

When the lake is thawed, the lake effect machine is alive. Once it freezes, we get a lot less precipitation.

The Great Lakes are above sea level about 600’.  And I’m told the lakes do pretty good at stabilizing temperature.  Of the coastal areas at least.  The he lake effect snow is also a thing, my city is south of Lake Erie so the west to east snow-dump isnt as bad where I am.  I also know that industrial and agricultural pollution has had and is having a huge effect on the lakes.  Both of those things are also drivers of climate change.  So if industry (like automotive) and farming haven’t changed the global climate far enough to affect the Midwest, I believe the Midwest is also being affected locally as a source. 
That idea might be too out there, but I think there have been more drastic temp changes in recent years.  But even in Ohio people say, “if you don’t like the weather, wait fifteen minutes, it’ll change.”

That good ship and true was a bone to be chewed
When the gales of November came early

The ship was the pride of the American side
Coming back from some mill in Wisconsin
As the big freighters go, it was bigger than most
With a crew and good captain well seasoned
Concluding some terms with a couple of steel firms

And a wave broke over the railing
And every man knew, as the captain did too
T'was the witch of November come stealin'

They may have broke deep and took water

Of the wives and the sons and the daughters

Lake Huron rolls, Superior sings
In the rooms of her ice-water mansion
Old Michigan steams like a young man's dreams
The islands and bays are for sportsmen
And farther below Lake Ontario
Takes in what Lake Erie can send her
And the iron boats go as the mariners all know

In the maritime sailors' cathedral

Economic conservatives continually make the same mistake - they focus on individual behavior as if telling everyone to be better can solve any of these problems. It can't. In a global economy, individual consumers have no power to force changes on companies through their purchasing decisions.

The reason regulations exist is because it's simply not possible with the limited time that we all have to keep companies honest, and to expect that the honest ones are going to have any sort of advantage in a marketplace that is too overflowing with information and misinformation for the consumer to make informed decisions on every good they purchase.

Ultimately, whether or not I shop at Amazon makes zero difference towards the company's bottom line. Everybody else knows the same thing, and so in the aggregate there's no way to change them. We know this, because the fact that individuals will act in their own self-interest is a foundational principle of free market economics.

Regulations allow both businesses and consumers to make better ethnical choices. Again, we know this is true based on generations of empirical evidence - just look at Lake Erie, and the impact that EPA regulations had on it even within a 20-year time span starting in the '70s.

We don't breathe smog-filled air because of pollution controls. The hole in the ozone layer is gone because of CFC regulations. Kids aren't eating leaded paint chips or breathing leaded gasoline fumes, because of lead regulations. Vehicle fatalities have dropped tremendously since the 1970s because of vehicle safety regulations.

The idea that the market freedoms allow for the best possible results for society is nothing more than pure brainwashing propaganda by pro-business forces.

&gt;Of all the Great Lakes, Lake Erie is exposed to the greatest stress from urbanization, industrialization and agriculture. Lake Erie surpasses all the other Great Lakes in the amount of effluent received from sewage treatment plants and is also most subjected to sediment loading due to the nature of the underlying geology and land use. Exposed agricultural and urban lands, particularly in southwest Ontario and northwest Ohio, contribute immense sediment loads to the lake.

If we can keep restoring the health of Lake Erie, Ohio's proximity to this source of fresh water will be a benefit.

As climate change spurs mass human migrations, you will slowly see the value of land in Ohio climb, especially in the north, near the lake.

[https://elpc.org/](https://elpc.org/)

  
The Environmental Law &amp; Policy Center is fully funded by private foundations and individuals - no fossil-fuel money and no government grants. Why no government grants? Because we're not afraid to sue the federal government (or state governments) when it means doing the right thing. Here is some of the work I'm most proud of from 2022:  
1) We successfully sued the Federal EPA and Ohio EPA in a landmark case to reduce agricultural runoff pollution – fertilizer and manure – into the Maumee River Watershed which flows into Lake Erie, causing harmful algae blooms. Algae blooms from corporate agriculture threaten all 5 Great Lakes. Read more here: https://elpc.org/.../elpc-lucas-county-board-of.../  
2) We successfully sued the Cleveland Cliffs steel mill in Northwest Indiana for a devastating cyanide and ammonia spill in August 2019 that killed thousands of fish and closed Lake Michigan beaches. The steel mill discharges into the east branch of the Little Calumet River, which flows directly into Lake Michigan. Read more here: https://elpc.org/.../cleveland-cliffs-consent-decree.../  
3) ELPC’s new Rising Waters Report identifies twelve areas along the Lake Michigan shoreline where high lake levels and strong storms could impact industrial facilities, contaminated sites, and residential communities. We’re working with federal, state, and local policymakers to make the investments and policy shifts that will protect Lake Michigan drinking water. Read more here: https://elpc.org/.../rising-waters-climate-change.../  
4) Our Keep The UP Wild campaign is working to create over 50,000 acres of new Federal Wilderness in the Ottawa National Forest in MI. https://www.keeptheupwild.com/ We have a similar project (no seto create 12,000 acres of new Federal Wilderness in Shawnee National Forest in Southern IL.

If you are interested in the situation here are some snippets for this article: https://www.greatlakesnow.org/2020/09/drinking-unsafe-water-contaminants-solutions/ 

""Seth Siegel, author of Troubled Water: What’s Wrong With What We Drink, underscores the evolution over time in contamination concerns, from the biological to the chemical. “A dab of chlorine might address microorganisms, but it does nothing about these synthetics,” he says. “We are ingesting, in micro quantities, a cocktail of chemicals all the time.”


The Clean Water Act, in theory, regulates discharges into U.S. waters and therefore protects sources of drinking water. However, this year the Trump administration issued a new regulation, the Navigable Waters Protection Rule, that narrows the scope of the Clean Water Act by revoking federal protections for millions of miles of streams and millions of acres of wetlands. The NRDC and other environmental groups have filed a lawsuit to stop the decision.

“If we don’t have a strong Clean Water Act, we’ll never have clean drinking water,” says Lynn Thorp, national campaigns director for the nonprofit Clean Water Action. “We need to put equal effort upstream.”



Outdated standards
Even when the law is enforced, advocates lament that the standards used are often outdated. The current federal drinking water standard for nitrate, for example, went into effect in 1992 at 10 parts per million. Yet research has found that levels less than one-tenth of that legal limit may raise the risk of cancer and other health issues. In early 2019, the EPA suspended plans to reevaluate the nitrate standard.

The EPA did propose an update in October 2019 to its rules on lead and copper, which had not been touched since 1991. Meanwhile, the House of Representatives approved new legislation this past July that authorizes US$22.5 billion to replace a portion of the country’s estimated 6 to 10 million lead service lines that remain, connecting water mains to homes in Flint, Newark and elsewhere. Kail says that AWWA supports the revision. “As long as there is lead in contact with the water, some level of risk remains,” he says. “So the best cure is to get the lead out.”

Advocates argue the rules still won’t go far enough or come fast enough. And they suggest the same generally holds for the EPA’s actions or inactions on drinking water quality. Of most concern, they say, are the potentially hazardous contaminants that still lack a standard. “The law really is broken and needs to be fixed if it is going to protect the public,” says Olson.

The EPA’s current process for developing new standards, defined in the 1996 amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act, needs to be sped up and strengthened, he and other advocates say. The EPA’s Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule (UCMR) allows the EPA to select up to 30 unregulated pathogens and pollutants to be monitored every five years. Public drinking water systems serving at least 10,000 people, along with a representative sample of smaller systems, must periodically test for these contaminants. The agency uses the data in considering future drinking water standards.

So far, the only new chemical that the agency has come close to regulating through the process is perchlorate, a component of rocket fuel, munitions and fireworks. Studies suggest that exposure may derail brain development of fetuses and infants. The EPA determined in 2011 that the contaminant required regulation. But this June, the agency reversed course and announced that, taking into consideration “the best available science and the proactive steps that EPA, states and public water systems have taken to reduce perchlorate levels,” it would not regulate perchlorate. That decision is now in litigation. “The EPA just hasn’t had the spine to issue any regulations off the contaminant candidate list,” says Olson.

Six perfluorinated chemicals were monitored via the UCMR between 2013 and 2015. This past February, the EPA announced preliminary regulatory determinations and opened up comments for two of those chemicals, PFOA and PFOS. Meanwhile, several states, including New Jersey and New Hampshire, have moved ahead with their own regulations, some of which go beyond PFOA and PFOS — the legacy PFAS compounds that are already being phased out — to include more of the potentially thousands of extremely persistent synthetic chemicals that belong to the same class.


Pathogens and pesticides
Pathogens remain a serious issue, too. E. coli in drinking water has caused deadly outbreaks. Norovirus, Giardia and cryptosporidium have also contaminated drinking water supplies in recent years. But the pathogens perhaps highest on the minds of experts today are those that grow in pipes.

Legionella, the bacterium that causes Legionnaires’ disease, a type of pneumonia, offers a critical case in point. It poses a microbiological threat with widespread consequences. In Flint, the same issue that caused the release of lead into the drinking water also resulted in deadly cases of Legionnaires’ disease in the surrounding community. Repeated outbreaks at a Quincy, Illinois, veterans home have killed more than a dozen people since 2015. And, in May 2019, a custodian died from Legionnaires’ disease after being infected at Kettering Fairmont High School in Kettering, Ohio. The school’s water tested positive for Legionella this July, and a current custodian has tested positive for the disease. Spokespeople with the Illinois veterans home and the Ohio high school note that measures have been taken to reduce the risk of further infections.

Agricultural practices remain implicated in much of the nation’s tainted drinking water. Studies have shown that pesticides pose a serious threat. For example, atrazine has been associated with low birth weight in babies.

“Every spring in the Midwest, a pulse of atrazine comes off the fields. Tough luck on you if you happen to be carrying a child during that period,” says Sedlak, noting that regulatory standards might still be met because EPA regulations average numbers over the course of an entire year.

Neonicotinoids are another example. “Neonics are wonderful [from a human health perspective] because they target receptors specific to insects,” Sedlak says. “But, after a chemical reaction with chlorine, the product is something that is likely to target people.” Limited data hints at potential health effects ranging from respiratory, cardiovascular and neurological issues to birth defects.

Excess fertilizer applications on farms also trigger major algal blooms that can contaminate drinking water. Toxins produced by blue-green algae (also known as cyanobacteria) in Lake Erie fed by runoff from farms in the watershed contaminated the Toledo, Ohio, drinking water system in the summer of 2014. Almost half a million people were told to avoid drinking, bathing or cooking with their tap water for a couple of days; 110 people got sick. It was neither the first nor the last time that such toxins threatened public health. Residents of Carroll Township, Ohio, received a similar warning in September 2013. And in July 2018, authorities in Salem, Oregon, advised children and the elderly not to drink the city’s water.",0

Of the big lake they called Gitche Gumee
The lake, it is said, never gives up her dead
When the skies of November turn gloomy
With a load of iron ore twenty-six thousand tons more
Than the Edmund Fitzgerald weighed empty
That good ship and true was a bone to be chewed
When the gales of November came early
The ship was the pride of the American side
Coming back from some mill in Wisconsin
As the big freighters go, it was bigger than most
With a crew and good captain well seasoned
Concluding some terms with a couple of steel firms
When they left fully loaded for Cleveland
And later that night when the ship's bell rang
Could it be the north wind they'd been feelin'?
The wind in the wires made a tattle-tale sound
And a wave broke over the railing
And every man knew, as the captain did too
T'was the witch of November come stealin'
The dawn came late and the breakfast had to wait
When the gales of November came slashin'
When afternoon came it was freezin' rain
In the face of a hurricane west wind
When suppertime came, the old cook came on deck sayin'
""Fellas, it's too rough to feed ya""
At seven PM, a main hatchway caved in, he said
""Fellas, it's been good to know ya""
The captain wired in he had water comin' in
And the good ship and crew was in peril
And later that night when his lights went outta sight
Came the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald
Does any one know where the love of God goes
When the waves turn the minutes to hours?
The searchers all say they'd have made Whitefish Bay
If they'd put fifteen more miles behind her
They might have split up or they might have capsized
They may have broke deep and took water
And all that remains is the faces and the names
Of the wives and the sons and the daughters
Lake Huron rolls, Superior sings
In the rooms of her ice-water mansion
Old Michigan steams like a young man's dreams
The islands and bays are for sportsmen
And farther below Lake Ontario
Takes in what Lake Erie can send her
And the iron boats go as the mariners all know
With the gales of November remembered
In a musty old hall in Detroit they prayed
In the maritime sailors' cathedral
The church bell chimed 'til it rang twenty-nine times
For each man on the Edmund Fitzgerald

https://saultonline.com/2021/08/viewpoint-sault-ste-marie-blue-green-algae-and-new-brunswick-neurological-desease/

One neurotoxin is BMAA (beta methylamino-L-alanine) which is linked to increased risk of developing ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or Lou Gehrig disease), a catastrophic and uniformly fatal neurodegenerative disease.

Clusters of ALS have been reported around lakes and areas of oceans with blue-green algae blooms.

Researchers at Dartmouth Medical Center have identified ALS hot spots in lake and coastal communities with toxic blooms of blue-green algae in New England, a large one in Vermont near Lake Champlain and a smattering of smaller ones among coastal communities in New Hampshire and Maine.

There is a blue-green algae bloom at the western end of Lake Erie that has grown to cover 620 square miles.

A Cleveland Clinic neurologist has plotted a mega-cluster of over 1,000 cases of ALS in the northwest corner of Ohio, near the western shore of Lake Erie.

Researchers strongly suspect that fish and shellfish from waters contaminated with cyanobacteria blooms may be one way that people ingest BMAA.

In southern France, researchers suspect ALS cases may be linked to consumption of mussels and oysters.

Lobsters, collected off the Florida coast near blooms, also have been found with high levels of BMAA.

Three sporadic ALS patients lived in Annapolis, Maryland, and developed the disease within a relatively short time and within close proximity to each other.

The common factor among them was the frequent consumption of blue crab which were found to have high levels of BMAA.

Investigators concluded that the presence of BMAA in the Chesapeake Bay food web and the lifetime consumption of blue crab contaminated with BMAA probably led to these cases of ALS.

The indigenous Chamorro people on the South Pacific island of Guam have a diet that has one of the highest levels of BMAA in the world.

t1_hr0q7mi,TooAfraidToAsk,2022-01,2022-01-03 02:24:21,1,E,"I’m from Michigan and I’ll write a short list of why we hate Ohio: 
1. The fertilizer runoff from their never-ending swaths of farmland flows into Lake Erie and causes massive toxic algal blooms. 
2. Those same never-ending farmlands become mind-numbing any time you have to drive through the state. It takes approximately five hours to go straight through north —&gt; south, but it feels like days because it’s so *boring*. Oh, and you thought you were almost there? Just kidding, here’s some never-ending unnecessary construction that’ll send you on a half hour detour and get you all kinds of turned around, just to add to the misery.
3. Speaking of driving through, we’re notorious for speeding in MI: if the speed limit says 70 mph, you better be doing at least 78 or your ass is gonna get tailgated. But Ohio? Don’t even THINK about it. As soon as you cross the border, there is ALWAYS a cop waiting to catch people going 2-3 mph over. Best keep it at a cool 65, lest you face the wrath of the boys in blue. And 65mph for *five fucking hours* makes the drive feel even *longer*. 
4. More driving stuff: be prepared to spend up to $15-20 USD as you drive because Ohio has TOLLS. We Michiganders don’t believe in the concept. And yes, our roads suck. But we’re proud of them anyways because we already pay for them with our hard-earned tax dollars, dammit! Never mind having to pay EXTRA for roads you’ve already paid for! Also, is there really any good way to make sure that your check engine light still works other than clobbering a good ol’ Michigan pothole? 
5. Ohio State University vs Michigan State University and/or University of Michigan. Never has a greater rivalry festered, and never has there been one more bitter. Wear a Buckeyes jersey in our state at your own risk. 
6. Ohio would love to be as innovative and world-changing as Michigan. Yeah, sure, whatever, a whole bunch of astronauts and pilots were born there. Y’know how those guys got to NASA or their flight schools? By driving in CARS. Y’know where the most automobiles came from soon after they were invented? Michigan, and more specifically, Detroit. The moon is cool and all I guess, but cars permanently changed the entire world. 
7. The Toledo War: before Michigan was a state, Ohio had the audacity to try and lay claim to a section of the Michigan Territory. After a bitter (but bloodless) dispute, Ohio got the Toledo Strip. We’ve never forgotten it. Now, we did end up getting the better deal because we wound up with the Upper Peninsula i.e. thousands of acres of beautiful forest, copper and iron mines that boosted our early economy, and access to Lake Superior. But still. The absolute *unmitigated gall*.
8. Ohio thinks they have bragging rights because seven US presidents were from there. But y’know what? They were all *the most forgettable* presidents ever. Names like Warren G Harding and James Garfield. But did they do anything noteworthy or memorable? Who the fuck knows what they did?? Not me. *Except for Ulysses S Grant- he helped end the Civil War. Dude was ‘aight. 
9. They’ve passed some headass backwards laws recently concerning women’s rights, gay rights, etc. Conservative as fuck with zero qualms about being rude to your face. At least in the South they’re nice about it and throw a “bless your heart” in there with their ass-backwards thinking. 
10. Ohio’s state flag is the only state flag that isn’t a rectangle. Why? For what? Do they think they’re fuckin’ special or something??

In conclusion, from a proud ‘n’ Pure Michigander, fuck Ohio.",0

The runoff comes from pig farms in Michigan which liquify the pig waste and spray it on crops in the Maumee basin.  Because the area was a drained swamp, the land is covered with clay irrigation pipes which drain the liquid from the land and feed it right into the river with no natural filtering in the soil.  The river then dumps the phosphorous and nitrogen into the lake.  Many of these farms are growing the subsidized animal feed that goes back to those pig farms.  

Nobody wants to do anything about it because we've deified the farmer as some humble symbol of Americana, when in reality these farms are almost all owned by corporations.",0

Your first article just says the fishermen think the waters are too clean which is hindering their catch. Which is incorrect and opinion based 

In the 20th century the lake was bombarded by intensified agriculture runoff and industrial wastewater pollution which resulted in eutrophication and the formation of the international commission for the protection of Lake Constance. Since then, they put stricter standards on the industrial and agricultural sector. 

In short: the lake went through a phase of eutrophication caused by industry wastewater and agricultural runoff which depleted aquatic species and dissolved oxygen.

An international effort to address the problem resulted in more strict standards of discharge leading to a phase of of oligotrophication (reverse of eutrophication).

Oligotrophication is the dip in nutrients as the system tries to reach a stable level. Here is where you’ll see the absence of aquatic life or “clean water.”

By no means is agricultural runoff and excess nutrients okay. There are safe limits according to TMDLs and the Clean Water Act (in the U.S.). But disrupting natural nutrient cycles with an artificial effluent will alter the system. 

I just wanted to bring this to awareness so that members of this sub don’t go around dumping P and N in their streams.

Again, we ship drinking water around the world in plastic bottles, so that completely defeats your argument about shipping drinking water a thousand miles to California. We already do. In high cost small units.

Desalination via membrane presents all kinds of problems of it's own. California already has limited desalination and it's not cheap and it's no panacea. If it were the holy grail, water scarcity wouldn't be a global issue.

Water in Canada - 60% of our water drains north. Much of that could be diverted south (except for laws preventing it). Great Lakes, Lake Winnipeg, Lake Manitoba, etc.

t1_htbrtv2,IndianCountry,2022-01,2022-01-19 15:20:31,1,A,"From the article:

&gt;**Early last year, the state of Wisconsin issued a fish consumption advisory that recommended eating no more than one meal a month of Lake Superior rainbow smelt, caught by tribes and local anglers during smelt runs in the spring**. It was the first advisory for any of the Great Lakes warning of fish with elevated levels of PFAS.  
&gt;  
&gt;PFAS are known as “forever chemicals” because they don’t break down in the environment. After years of industrial use, the federal government recently took steps to regulate them. **But will it be enough to assure the safety of the Indigenous people who have fished on the lake for thousands of years — and depend on the fish for survival?**

PFAS forever chemicals affect EVERYONE!  Most NDNs in my tribe, including myself, regularly go fishing &amp; depend on fish for food from our rivers &amp; lakes.  Friday Fish Frys are a cherished tradition in Wisconsin, among Natives &amp; Non-Natives alike.

This news article is distressing to me; I'm sorry this is happening.  When I was younger, after we got back our Rez lands, I felt like we could close ourselves off (from an environmental perspective) from the dominant society destructive ways then we'd be okay.  This was around the time when Lake Erie had caught on fire.  I thought if we followed our traditional ways, then that was what mattered &amp; we'd survive.

Then came Acid Rain.  I realized dominant society's pollution rained on us, too.  We could be doing the right thing, but we're indirectly affected by others.  We're all in this together.  We need to work together to stop destroying our planet!  I still have hope.",0

They'll walk on their fins and get woeful and weary in search of some water that isint so smeary. I hear things are just as bad up in Lake Erie.""

-From The Lorax 

When the lorax was written public opinion was changing due to the Cleveland River catching on fire and their drinking water being contaminated. Public outcry during this time birthed the clean water act. Dr. Suess eventually changed the wording in the book at the request of some students from the Ohio Sea Grant Education Program once things had began to change for the better in Lake Erie but in his return letter he wrote-

""I can assure you the process of purifying my text will comemce immediately. Unfortunately, the purification of texts, like that of the lakes, cannot be accomplished overnight. The objectionable line will be removed from future editions. But it could be more then a year before the existing stock of books has moved out of the book stores."" 

For someone who grew up on the great lakes and has learned much about their troubling history this story has always held a place close to me. The clean water act is an essential part of holding people and corporations accountable and protecting some of our most valuable resources. 

""Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. Its not.""",2

I can see where it can have an effect on small farms but with education and better farming practices its not very difficult to overcome the small hurdles. We still deal with massive issues like algae blooms in Lake Erie that are due to farms in Ohio overusing fertilizers and not using them at the proper time of the year. But again with the proper regulations and education this isint a difficult issue to overcome. Its much harder to push back on big corporations that have put refineries on our shores and are constantly being fined for toxic discharge into the lakes. Like most things this comes back to money in politics. Its hard to do what's right when those in charge are getting paid to stay silent. The best we can do is spread awareness and get us back to the point where the public demands the change.,1

So naturally, Ska'i 2 would make the perfect target in a war, and that's what happened.

The Great Atu'apol War came, and Ska'i 2 was designated a high value target once the Kor-Vosh Empire and the ATU went on the offensive. Kor-Vosh forces attacked the planet with thousands of nuclear weapons and neutron bombs. Nothing was to survive the assault, by order of the High Command of the Imperial Armada.

Indeed, nothing did survive. No buildings were left intact, all 500 million Atu'apol citizens were killed, and what was left behind was a nuclear and chemical wasteland.

Today, radiation levels are still too high on Ska'i 2 for anyone to visit, outside of professionals in maximum-protection hazmat suits. Chemicals from the refineries are still concentrated to dangerous levels in many spots on the planet's surface, coming in the form of contaminated water and soil. These concentrations prevent flora from growing in large swaths of Ska'i 2's surface, though areas with lower concentrations show sporadic plant growth. The rain is frequently acidic or otherwise laced with various toxins, forcing the surviving flora to evolve natural defenses. Fauna is almost nonexistent, with the largest animals still alive being no larger than a rat.

The planet's atmosphere has also been altered by the release of toxic chemicals. Aerosols are trapping more heat than the planet could handle, causing any large bodies of water to evaporate. However, aerosol concentrations are slowly dropping, and the planet's average temperatures along with them, so some bodies of water are making a comeback.

If you were to look at Ska'i 2 from low orbit, you would see its surface as a patchwork of mostly grays and browns, but with splotches of green and blue where plants and water have emerged. Remains of cities and other infrastructure is also visible from space, which look like differences in the surface's texture, and is accompanied by the craters and scorch marks from the nuclear blasts.

Should you be brave enough to land on Ska'i 2 with a hazmat suit, there isn't a lot to look at besides the city ruins. Every single building is at least partially collapsed, and you would probably see a haze. That haze is not smoke or smog, but clouds of chemicals evaporating from the soil, so DO NOT TAKE OFF YOUR HELMET! Outside of the ruins, you would find a whole lot of barren rock and soil, with plant remains strewn about. The bodies of water come in the form of rivers and lakes, with the largest lake being the size of Lake Erie. Surrounding the lakes and rivers are the remaining flora, mostly grasses and hardy bushes. Don't expect to see any animals - the animal population is very low and they spend most of their days in burrows.

Scientists estimate that it would take 25,000 years for the radiation and chemical concentrations to dissipate enough to be considered safe for people to walk on the planet's surface without a protective suit or breathing apparatus.",0

https://cen.acs.org/environment/pollution/Marking-50-years-since-Cuyahoga/97/i24

&gt;Despite these and other cleanup efforts over the past 50 years, the Cuyahoga is still considered an environmentally degraded waterway. Some 75 km of the Cuyahoga River upstream from Lake Erie is deemed one of 43 environmental “areas of concern” under the US-Canada Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. These areas are considered impaired by pollution or other environmental problems in their ability to support aquatic life or beneficial use by people, such as fishing or maintaining a navigation channel.
&gt;According to the EPA, the Cuyahoga remains impaired in a number of ways. The river’s fish population is degraded, some fish have tumors or other deformities, and the finned swimmers have lost habitat. The river’s channel has a set of problems too. Populations of organisms that dwell in the Cuyahoga’s muddy bottom are dwindling. Dredging of the channel to improve navigation is restricted because sediments are contaminated. And water quality remains problematic. The river is prone to algal blooms, and the pollution the Cuyahoga carries into Lake Erie regularly leads to beach closures along the lakefront.",1

t1_iedwtdp,TheHandmaidsTale,2022-06,2022-06-30 23:41:17,1,D,"In the novel, due to environmental pollutants, industrial waste, AIDS, nuclear plant accidents, pesticides, and the spread of disease, there was a lot of infertility. The reasons were discussed in detail in the Afterword written in the future, and also during the novel Aunt Lydia gives us a contemporary perspective. Basically, the causes of infertility were a laundry list of things people were concerned about in the 1970s and early 1980s. Like nowadays we talk a lot about global warming but back then there was a lot more concern about environmental pollution since there hadn't been an EPA until 10 years before the book was written and environmental pollution ran rampant and was quite visibly bad, with multiple scandals, deaths, and visibly bad air. Lake Erie caught on fire. And AIDS had only been around for a few years and no one knew where it was headed but we were sure it would get worse and spread more into the general community, and at the time Atwood wrote the novel there were no treatments and it was a death sentence within a few years for almost everybody. Also the first IVF baby was in 1978 in the UK and 1981 in the US so when she wrote the book in 1984 it was still the dawn of the really amazing fertility treatments we have now and we had not yet seen its impact so treatments for infertility were more limited. Likewise surrogate motherhood didn't formally start until the year after this came out. So in the novel, some infertility was of women, some was of men, but since Gilead didn't recognize male infertility, only women got blamed or examined. There was an implication that the commanders were older, so their couples were affected by the infertility starting during their fertile years but by the time of the novel, many had aged out of their fertile years. So like the women might have been fertile when younger but the men were not but since that wasn't acknowledged, the fertile women ended up being unimpregnatable (impregnable? unimpregnable?). Others of the women had been fertile but were now too old. 

So basically in the book there might be couples with biological kids and also couples with handmaid-made kids, but due to the nature of the book, they focus only on the handmaid families. TV shows tend to simplify, so they didn't bother showing us the families with bio kids. Though it's implied that even if you have bio kids, you can still get a handmaid as a perk.

As for the fertile women: if a woman is fertile and also does not fall afoul of the new rules of Gilead (such as having had an abortion, gotten divorced, committed adultery, married a man who was divorced, lived with a man out of wedlock, evidence of an affair with a married man, having had a job that was offensive to them in some way, etc.), then such a woman would be a Wife (wife of someone of the upper class) or Econowife (a wife for someone of the lower class). If she had fallen afoul of their rules but was fertile, then she might be executed, sterilized and made into a prostitute, or made into a handmaid. If she was infertile and unmarried, then she might be a Martha if religious, or declared an unwoman and sent to the colonies. Or if young and attractive and thin but sterile, she might be sent to Jezebels to be a prostitute.

But the number of fertile women had overall gone down due to disease and pollution.",0

About half of Ohio is flat, glacially scoured plains. The other half is a series of rolling hills, created by ice age glaciers depositing moraines and till through out the state and an ancient, eroded plateau. To the north is Lake Erie, and to the south is the Ohio river. When settlers arrived in Ohio, they encountered a mix of forests, prairies, and wetlands.

The opening of overland roads in the early 19th century, and later the Erie and C&amp;O canals facilitated westward migration. The area centered on Milan, OH became one of the most bountiful agriculture hubs in the world. Milan itself was for a period of around 20 years one of the most busiest ports in the world, despite the town being 10-15 miles inland from Lake Erie.

t1_hw4kc0g,developmentreview,2022-02,2022-02-08 20:05:07,1,C,"A lot of the extremely specific stormwater requirements come from applicable permits and watersheds. Does your community have a Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) permit? Are you in a watershed with a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) for Total Phosphorus and/or Suspended Solids? Are you in an undeveloped rural area or an urban area with flooding issues?

In the Midwest near the Great Lakes, for example, there are tons of impaired waterways each with their own level of TMDL implementation status and limits. Some larger Cities even have different quality treatment goals for different areas within City limits depending on the drainage watershed.

I'm a member of a regional stormwater consortium, and our state stopped accepting our regional MS4 reports due to all the specific requirements. 

It's difficult to consolidate all these requirements into a region much less an entire state, especially since the EPA/DNR guidelines aren't exactly set in stone beyond ""make a plan to meet these quality limits,"" and then leave state and local agencies to scramble.

As a land development engineer though, I have to agree on the transparency issue- Dear lordy, do I hate going on a manhunt for stormwater requirements on duct-taped municipal websites, only to call and get ghosted, or find out staff has no clue if they even have an Ordinance. (Not that it's their fault either- municipalities are already stretched so thin and public education/funding in stormwater is severely lacking.)",0

You can easily find 100s of fish populations in both fresh and salt water which have been damaged, heavily reduced, or gone extinct due to over harvest. The Atlantic Cod stock off Canada for example.  Bluefin tuna.  Orange roughy.  Swordfish.  Yellow perch in Lake Erie, and the now extinct blue pike.  

There's nothing wrong at all with responsible harvest of fish.  I keep a few each year myself and enjoy fish dinner.  The problem is the attitude of ""I keep everything that's legal.""  A fat female fish full of eggs should be released.  A rare but important fish in an ecosystem, like a muskie, should be released.  Fish that's just going to end up getting freezer burned because you've already got tons in the freezer?  Yeah, let them go.  Around here we call those people ""pigs."" 

  Being greedy and keeping everything just damages the resource for others.  Why would you release a fish for someone else to catch it? So they can enjoy that fish, too.  Fish populations and the rivers, lakes, streams and oceans they inhabit are constantly on the brink and if you enjoy eating the fish you catch and enjoy fishing, you need to do your part by being responsible with your harvest and preserving it for others to enjoy, too.  It's simple to understand.

Catch and release is what most fisherman these days practice and it's helped preserve fish populations all over the world.  If done properly, the vast majority of fish survive with very little damage and go on to grow and breed.",0

In Flint, MI, which still does not have a complete safe water system, several factors screwed them.  The city was home to multiple automobile supply chain factories early to mid 20th century, and those factories dumped waste straight into the Flint River.  We'll, all the factories left, exploitable workers were cheaper elsewhere.  the Flint River is still unsafe for use.  A couple years ago the bankrupt city was taken over by the State, who decided the water bill was too high.  So they switched supplies from the Great Lakes to the Flint River, while at the same time cutting use of multiple additives the city usually put in.

It is cool (temperature) and flows quickly due to century old dredging to allow freighters to travel from the Atlantic to Chicago.

One topic that came up multiple times was toxic algae blooms in Lake Erie—heavy influx of fertilizer pollution from the Ohio River combined with a relatively shallower basin (warmer water) has made the Lake have huge blooms regularly during the summer. IIRC they’ve had to shut water off in Cleveland a couple of times because of this. This is also a big problem in Green Bay, and in other parts of Great Lakes. 

In general, it’s my understanding that pollution can pretty easily become concentrated at certain points of the Lakes because of the way water circulates through them—Lake Michigan south/southeast of Chicago tends to have higher levels of pollution, chemical and plastic, than much of the rest of the Lake partly because of the population and industrial concentration, but also because of currents in the Lake.

t1_i2nc43z,science,2022-03,2022-03-29 23:27:13,1,D,"Back in the 80s, Lake Erie began to have a problem with the expansion of an invasive species called a Zebra Mussel. They would coat the surface of everything, even threatening to clog the water intake that provided drining water to Cleveland. They had been brought in the bilgewater of foreign cargo ships. 

Authorities were stumped as to how to get rid of them, and even had a competition with a substantial prize for anyone that could find a solution to get rid of the Zebra Mussels. It turned out, all they had to do was wait.

Lake Erie's water was notoriously murky, full of organic material that made the underwater view very poor. The Zebra Mussels loved that organic material, and it contributed to their spread. As they multiplied, and ingested more and more of the organic matter, sunlight began to penetrate the water for the first time in decades. It turned out that Zebra Mussels didn't like the sunlight, and began to die off. Eventually, they reached an equilibrium between the amount of sunlight and the amount of organic food material and they are no longer considered the big threat they once were. 

The new, clearer waters also spawned a new popularity in wreck diving. Because it is the shallowest of the Great Lakes, storms have always quickly turned dangerous on Lake Erie, and there are more wrecks on the floor of Lake Erie than any other, stretching back to the 17th century. With the higher visibility, it is much easier to explore these shallow water wrecks.

Somehow, nature always finds a way.",0

""The mollusks, known as zebra and quagga mussels, arrived from Eastern Europe in the late 1980s by latching onto boats and have since spread throughout the Great Lakes.

And, in terms of water quality, the critters are a reverse filter: They remove sediment and food particles out of the water, sapping the resources native mussels and fish need.

But they leave the dangerous elements in place. The invaders are picky and don't absorb toxic forms of algae known as microcystis, leaving it to collect in the harmful blue-green algae blooms that collect on the surface.""",0

One point I don’t agree with is increasing lot-coverage as a move in isolation as the Region relies heavily (80%) on groundwater for water supply. We need to keep rainwater where it falls and minimize paving paradise so our rainfall doesn’t end up in the Grand / Lake Erie. We should not need a pipeline from the Great Lakes - this will be more expensive to treat as well. Also, we need to maintain some level of canopy for shade / temperature control and biodiversity (a girl can dream?).

AITA for wanting to kick my sons girlfriend ( gf) out?

Some background.  My youngest son (30) and his daughter (4) have been living with me about 3 yrs.  It's been nice.  I only have a 2 bedroom trailer but it's in a lovely place. My front door opens to a view of lake Erie, we have a beach and a pool.  There's only about 20 of us who live here full time, the rest are ppl who own homes and come to their trailers during the summers.  Everyone loves my grandaughter and it's a very safe place to live.  They don't allow trouble makers in here.
About 6 months ago my oldest son asked if he (34) and his gf (23) could move in.  They had nowhere to go, and both my kids inherited my 3 autoimmune diseases which makes it very difficult to hold employment.
My younger son is doing everything he should be.  He has a case manager, has applied for disability ( he's had a job since 16yrs old), he receives counseling and sees his dr.s Once a month.
I told my son he and his gf needed to do the same things.  I didn't realize what I was in for.  They fight non stop.  She's been to the physch ward 3 times, but never follows up with aftercare.  I'm all for giving ppl with mental illness a chance, but not when they refuse the help they've been handed.  I also don't want my grandaughter raised in an abusive environment, and I'm afraid if she keeps screaming well get kicked out.   I told my son his gf had to go.  He called me an asshole for kicking a poor helpless person out.
So Am I being an asshole?  Or am I doing right by putting my grandaughters needs 1st?

Second, many states barely regulate bait suppliers at all. Sure, they have licenses and permits, and occasional inspections. But there's a lot of shady stuff that happens even in the above-board providers. By accident or intention.

 Hell, in some states it is legal to use goldfish as bait, and they can be horribly invasive

Anglers should NEVER release store-bought bait into the water. 

In most cases the bait won't survive, but there's plenty of invasive populations that get started from bait releases. 

Here's a great example:

&gt;Bait and pond stores comprise potential, yet poorly understood, vectors for aquatic invasive species (AIS). We tested for AIS and illegal native species in 51 bait and 21 pond stores from the central Great Lakes (Lake Erie, Ohio and Lake St. Clair, Michigan) and the adjacent Wabash River (Indiana) using environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcode assays of water samples and morphological identifications. Retailers were questioned about supply chains, and anglers surveyed about baitfish use and disposal. Assays revealed unadvertised species eDNA in 100% of bait stores, with 61% containing illegal native non-bait (totaling 13 species) and 88% having AIS (11 species). Illegal native non-bait species included juvenile walleye, yellow perch, and white sucker eDNA. AIS eDNA included Eurasian ruffe in seven stores (all states), silver carp in five (including a Lake Erie store in two separate years), and bighead carp in two Lake Erie stores that also had silver carp. Among pond stores, two in Lake St. Clair had bighead carp eDNA, one also contained silver carp, and a Wabash River location showed European ide. Unadvertised invasive snails were discerned in 55% of pond stores. Four contained zebra mussel eDNA and two had invasive bryozoans. Illegal native species and AIS were widespread, but showed little relationship to the retailers' variable and extensive supply chains. Live baitfish releases were reported by 50% of Lake Erie anglers and 35% in Lake St. Clair. Consumer behavior and AIS prevalence in the bait and pond trades thus pose serious risks for introductions and spread.

It was back in the 90s I was swimming in about six foot of water where I noticed strange little fish on the bottom in which I had never seen before. I reported this sighting to the local Sr aquatic biologist. A couple years later it came out about the round Goby. At that time there was a lot of speculation like the Goby is going to poison the local fish. That never happened as it turned out the round Goby was a favorite treat for many species of fish. One of the effects was the lakes population of yellow Perch was at a severe decline. The perch ended up making a rebound due to feeding on Goby. As I mentioned before there is a major decline of Emerald shinners and rainbow smelt in lake Erie. The lack of Emerald shinners might have been the reason why we seen that decline. Emerald shinners are one of the yellow Perch favorite forage bait fish. Can we call the the minnows Lady? Lol being a over the edge hard core fisherman that's a compliment. Are you single lol

No but I attended a lecture on the ecology of climate change and discussing the increasing prévenance of Cyanobacteria blooms was a big part of it.

The limiting factors of blooms are different for salt water and freshwater (one is phosphates, one is nitrates).

Again I didn’t disagree that salt/rock salt has been linked to blooms, but there’s well established precedent that fertilizer runoff contributes to blooms.

The record setting bloom in Lake Erie back in 2011 wasn’t from road salt, it was [from fertilizer](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1216006110):

&gt; In 2011, Lake Erie experienced the largest harmful algal bloom in its recorded history, with a peak intensity over three times greater than any previously observed bloom. Here we show that **long-term trends in agricultural practices are consistent with increasing phosphorus loading** to the western basin of the lake, and that these trends, coupled with meteorological conditions in spring 2011, produced record-breaking nutrient loads. An extended period of weak lake circulation then led to abnormally long residence times that incubated the bloom, and warm and quiescent conditions after bloom onset allowed algae to remain near the top of the water column and prevented flushing of nutrients from the system. 

Here’s a link from NOAA discussing the link between [Urea based fertilizer and Blue-Green Algae blooms](https://coastalscience.noaa.gov/news/urea-based-fertilizer-promotes-blue-green-algal-blooms-in-sarasota-bay-florida/) choking the gulf coast.

On the plus side there is kayaking, but that's good for what . . . maybe an afternoon?

Coming back from some mill in Wisconsin
As the big freighters go, it was bigger than most
With a crew and good captain well seasoned
Concluding some terms with a couple of steel firms

The only real problem you have is the lake is so shallow so it gets pretty warm and can foster e. coli levels that are unsafe as some of the beaches closest to the shore.  They test daily and will close those beaches if it exceeds a certain level.  Keep in mind that is for Presque Isle, where they truck in tons of sand every year.  The natural lakefront doesn't have issues like that due to increased circulation, although there are occasional algae blooms.

Unfortunately, even if some heavier flows came through and pushed the trash out it would just be shifting the problem somewhere else, Lake Erie or further downstream, so like you indicated, a cleanup would definitely be in order. If the city isn’t very responsive (hopefully they are) Partners for Clean Streams would probably be another good group to bring this up with. 

I did want to mention to anyone that wasn’t aware that the city has recently used grant money to install “trash trappers” (unfortunately not as cool as trash wheels) in local waterways to collect trash, and one of them is located near here just a bit upstream from the confluence of Swan Creek and the Maumee. So hopefully this trash trappers is working and keeping more trash from flowing down into the problem area OP noted, and it’s worth noting that the city is actively trying to reduce trash in our waterways. But that’s all tangential to the issue reported here, just wanted to share in case anyone hadn’t heard about this yet.

State officials on Wednesday announced that they have finalized remediation plans for the 489 acres of contaminated land nearest to the shoreline of the lake.

Those plans build on efforts that have already been underway for some time. Those efforts were unveiled in May and subject to public comments that were addressed in documents that detail the steps that will be taken and why that remedy was selected.

The aim is to restore the property and natural habitat in a way that protects human health and the environment, while advancing the state Department of Environmental Conservation's goals of preserving and connecting the site's natural resources, state officials said.

""My family worked at the Bethlehem Steel plant and I know firsthand what cleaning up the former site in Lackawanna means for the people who live here,"" said Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Lackawanna native. ""Today marks a critical milestone in the rebirth of this city and this project is the perfect example of how New York State is rebuilding communities by putting former industrial sites like Bethlehem Steel to good use.""

Once a dominant force in Lackawanna, Bethlehem Steel had used more than 1,600 acres for iron and steel production during its heyday, but left the site contaminated with arsenic and other metals, along with semi-volatile organic carbon compounds related to the use of rail transportation, oils, greases and fossil fuels, according to the state.

The remediation plans were required as part of a 2020 consent order about the cleanup between the DEC, Tecumseh Redevelopment and Tecumseh's former parent company, Arcelor Mittal USA, which assumed environmental responsibility after Bethlehem Steel's 2001 bankruptcy.

Various parts of the site will be handled under the state Superfund program, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Corrective Action Program and Brownfield Cleanup Program.

""The cleanup and redevelopment of the former Bethlehem Steel site will be transformative for the City of Lackawanna and all of Western New York,"" said DEC Commissioner Basil Seggos. ""This rebirth, advancing under DEC oversight to ensure it is protective of public health and the environment, will yield benefits for the entire community.""

The construction and cleanup work is expected to take seven years to complete. Details of the plans are available online.",2

In the days following the event, balloons were reported washed ashore on the Canadian side of Lake Erie.  
&gt;  
&gt;Two fishermen, Raymond Broderick and Bernard Sulzer, who had gone out on September 26, were reported missing by their families on the day of the event. Rescuers spotted their 16-foot (4.9 m) boat anchored west of the Edgewater Park breakwall. A Coast Guard search and rescue helicopter crew had difficulties reaching the area because of the ""asteroid field"" of balloons. A search-and-rescue boat crew tried to spot the fishermen floating in the lake, but Guard officials said balloons in the water made it impossible to see whether anyone was in the lake. On September 29, the Coast Guard suspended its search. The fishermen's bodies subsequently washed ashore.

&gt; But government ownership is not true ownership, because the government officials, while able to control the resource cannot themselves reap their capital value on the market. Government officials cannot sell the rivers or sell stock in them. Hence, they have no economic incentive to preserve the purity and value of the rivers. Rivers are, then, in the economic sense, ""unowned""; therefore government officials have permitted their corruption and pollution. Anyone has been able to dump polluting garbage and wastes in the waters. But consider what would happen if private firms were able to own the rivers and the lakes. If a private firm owned Lake Erie, for example, then anyone dumping garbage in the lake would be promptly sued in the courts for their aggression against private property and would be forced by the courts to pay damages and to cease and desist from any further aggression. Thus, only private property rights will insure an end to pollution — invasion of resources. Only because the rivers are unowned is there no owner to rise up and defend his precious resource from attack. If, in contrast, anyone should dump garbage or pollutants into a lake which is privately owned (as are many smaller lakes), he would not be permitted to do so for very long — the owner would come roaring to its defense.1 Professor Dolan writes:

&gt; &gt;With a General Motors owning the Mississippi River, you can be sure that stiff effluent charges would be assessed on industries and municipalities along its banks, and that the water would be kept clean enough to maximize revenues from leases granted to firms seeking rights to drinking water, recreation, and commercial fishing.2

Neither of these products are really naturally occurring though and as such, have side effects in manufacturing and in use. If you put dawn dish soap in water for example, it is chemically interacting with that water.

t1_hoo1uym,europe,2021-12,2021-12-15 17:27:26,1,B,"You can find Dubna, a small town three hours away from Moscow by train, both on a map and in the periodic table: dubnium, element number 105, was discovered at a research center there, and named after the town. A hasteless town, Dubna is defined as much by the surrounding forests as by the water: it sits on the banks of the Ivankovskoe Reservoir, the first part of a massive hydropower project called “Big Volga” whose construction spanned decades during the Soviet era. The complex, consisting of 11 dams on the Volga and its largest tributary, the Kama, is responsible for about 5% of the total electricity production in Russia. The Ivankovskoe Reservoir is both the oldest part of the complex and the farthest upstream, situated almost at the Volga’s headwaters.

About 2,300 miles long, the Volga—sometimes referred to as “Volga-matushka,” or “Mother Volga”—is the longest river in Europe and the biggest by water flow, arcing from northwest of Moscow around and down to the Caspian Sea. Some 60 million people—about 40% of Russia’s population—live in its basin, which spans almost a tenth of the country’s vast territory. Moscow, with its 12 million people, gets most of its drinking water from the Volga via the Moscow Canal. About 1,500 miles downstream, the strategic port city of Volgograd, formerly known as Stalingrad, was the site of World War II’s most decisive, and arguably bloodiest, battle. As an artery of commerce, a source of energy and drinking water, and a conveyor of history, the Volga touches nearly every aspect of life in Russia. It is what the Mississippi is to the United States or the Rhein to Germany.

When the station in Dubna was designed, in the early 1930s, the young Soviet state had just decided to catch up with the capitalist states of the West by rapidly accelerating its industrial development—but in order to do so, it needed to generate energy on a massive scale. By the time the last station was built, in the 1980s, the Soviet Union, having just hosted the Olympics for the first time, was about to launch perestroika, a program of large-scale democratic reforms intended to end an era of stagnation and revitalize the flailing state. The history of the Big Volga project is, in a sense, the history of Soviet industrialization. It is also a history of rivalry with the US, which for decades raced the Soviets to build bigger, more impressive dams.

The project was one of the largest nature-transforming schemes in history: put together, the artificial reservoirs on the Volga are about as big as Lake Erie. It tried to harness the river to provide the Russian people with necessary things: energy, transportation, and water. But it tried to do too much.

The river has become polluted, silted up, and overwhelmed by invasive species. Water flows at a tenth of the speed it did before the dams were constructed, according to estimates by researchers at the Institute of Ecology of the Volga River Basin, in the central Russian port city of Togliatti. Widespread toxic algal blooms are now common.

As global temperatures rise, the Volga basin is getting less and less rainfall in the spring and summer, and more snow in the winter. Igor Mokhov, chief scientist at the Obukhov Institute of Atmospheric Physics of the Russian Academy of Sciences, points out that the intensity of spring and summer precipitation is expected to increase, making post-high-water planning more difficult. A team of Russian hydrologists, writing in an August 2021 paper in Ecohydrology &amp; Hydrobiology, argued that because of climate change, “there will be more water in those regions \[of Russia\] where it is sufficient, and less where it is most needed.” The Volga basin is one of the regions most at risk, they wrote.

It is not an exaggeration to say that Russia’s mother river is broken.

I visited Dubna on a windy November morning. Runners in colorful clothing zipped by people walking their dogs along an unkempt reservoir front. I found myself in a grayscale photo of milky clouds and water like quicksilver, interrupted by the odd patch of evergreen and autumn brown. The opposite side of the reservoir was an impenetrable wall of coniferous trees, shrouded in a light mist.

I was trying, in vain, to orient myself to figure out how exactly one of the better-known stories about this reservoir must have unfolded. The story goes that in late November 1941, German forces were closing in on Moscow and had planned to cross the frozen body of water. The hydropower station workers reportedly decided to drain the reservoir, dropping water levels abruptly by two meters, crushing the ice and buying the city some time by stopping the invaders in their tracks. Eighty years later, though it was the same time of year, there was no ice in sight.

The hydropower station itself is a restricted site, encircled with an abundance of barbed wire, warning signs, and towering cranes so enormous there are small buildings on top of them. The noise of the water was pierced by seagulls and the occasional car as I walked along the dam. It was Unity Day, a modern Russian holiday devised to supersede a Communist holiday celebrating the 1917 revolution. Some of these people were driving to the Vladimir Lenin statue, a spot beloved by locals.

I could see Lenin’s back at the end of the road. The statue was surrounded by ceremonial blue-green fir trees, and looked across the water at nothing in particular. The corresponding monument to Joseph Stalin had been demolished in 1962, after the Soviet government decided to “de-Stalinize” itself. The two monuments, each almost 40 meters tall, once guarded the entry point to the Moscow Canal, a Soviet engineering marvel connecting the Volga and Moskva rivers.

Beside the complex, there is a memorial hardly taller than I am. It looks like a random granite building block, tilted to the side, seemingly thrown out by the mighty waters to the foot of the Lenin monument and behind its back. The stone was placed there in 2013 to commemorate the more than 22,000 prisoners who died building the canal. Flowers and wreaths at the bottom were still fresh from the annual ceremony, held on October 30, when Russians remember those persecuted and murdered by the state, usually by reading their names aloud in front of countless similar memorials across the nation.

A young boy in a yellow jacket asked his mother, who was putting their things into the car parked near the memorial, “Mom, what’s written on the stone?”

To the builders of the canal, she responded without looking.

This only made him ask her another question: “Why builders? Isn’t the Volga a real river?”

In a way it isn’t really a river anymore—it no longer flows naturally. It is now so mediated by human intervention that it is better thought of as a machine.

Just two months after the first gulag prisoners had arrived at the future dam site in Dubna, in November 1933, research bigwigs at the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union gathered in Moscow to discuss the state of the Volga and the Caspian Sea. Evgeny Burdin, a historian in the Volga town of Ulyanovsk, some 900 miles downstream from Dubna, read to me from one of the reports presented at the meeting. The report predicted that reservoirs would cause “swamp formation due to flooding, poor conditions for soil self-restoration, flooding of cellars in homes, changing microclimate, algae blooms and stale water, pollution, slowing down of water flow, and local risks of malaria.”

The river has become polluted, silted up, and overwhelmed by invasive species. Widespread toxic algal blooms are now common.

“Even if there wasn’t deep public awareness and discussion, surely many of the hydrologists and engineers knew that there would be significant and unavoidable impacts … Many people were aware of it, but it was very difficult, I’m sure, to say anything,” Paul R. Josephson, a professor of Russian and Soviet history at Colby College, told me.",0

&gt;CUYAHOGA RIVER FIRE

&gt;The CUYAHOGA RIVER FIRE (22 June 1969) dramatized the extent of the river's pollution and the ineffectiveness of the city's lagging pollution abatement program. The fire, which witnesses reported reached as high as 5 stories, began at 12 P.M. and lasted about 20 minutes before it was brought under control. A fireboat battled the blaze on the water while units from 3 fire battalions brought the flames on the railroad trestles under control. The bridge belonging to the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Co. sustained $45,000 in damage, forcing the company to close it to rail traffic. The other trestle, belonging to the [NEWBURGH &amp; SOUTH SHORE RAILROAD CO.](https://case.edu/ech/articles/n/newburgh-south-shore-railway/), incurred damages estimated at $5,000 but remained open. The blaze apparently was caused by an accumulation of oily wastes and debris on the river under 2 wooden trestles at the foot of Campbell Rd. hill, SE, in Cleveland. According to a subsequent investigation by Cleveland's Bureau of Industrial Wastes, the fire probably came from a discharge of highly volatile petroleum derivatives with a sufficiently low flash point to be ignited by a chance occurrence at the site of the railroad bridges.
Cleveland's reputation was severely damaged by the fire because at the time there was national concern about the pollution of Lake Erie and the rivers and streams that fed into it—particularly the Cuyahoga River, which was among the most polluted in the country. Ironically, another oil slick burned on the Cuyahoga River in 1952 causing an estimated $1.5 million damage without attracting national attention.

1.) Solar panels can be placed a lot of places in a lot of ways. You can stagger them so there’s a row of panels and a row of prairie. This actually makes the panels more effective as well since the plants help keep them cool through transpiration. At the very least, they’re less ugly than a coal power plant. They also won’t slowly give you cancer.

2.) So are the panels going in a forest or crop land?? I would agree that they shouldn’t put the panels on what would have been forest, but that’s very unlikely to happen anyway with how much deforested fallow land sits idly by. Farms are not part of the environment. Period. There are very few things that are more unnatural than huge monocultures of nonnative, domesticated plants. Farms actually cause a lot of pollution in Ohio. I can elaborate on this if you like, but it’s also very easily investigated. Look into the Lake Erie harmful algal bloom. Ohio farmers also are often paid to over farm or not farm at all. The US has had massive surpluses of both corn and soy since the 70’s. We clearly do not need to produce this much and can loose a little farm land. 

3.) Fighting climate change and local pollution is so incredibly much more expensive than the tax will be to build a solar facility. Plus, coal and gas have huge hidden fees that the tax payers cover as well. We fund the EPA and OEPA. If they have to spend millions if not more to fix superfund after superfund caused by fossil fuels, then that bill will be floated by us. 

4.) How much tourism? Good God, are people really that repulsed by blue, gray panels? Also, y’all think these panels are just going to be causally next to your downtown, lake, or river?? No, they’re gonna be in the middle of a field. 

5.) Once again, I really don’t think this ones that big of an issue either. I did a quick search and could only find evidence that it would increase your property values. Either way, I genuinely would let my house price depreciate by a few thousand if it means fewer fossil fuels.

6.) This is the most valid of the arguments, by far. I will give y’all that. It is hard if not near impossible *currently* to recycle panels that have reached the end of their life, but it is still by far more efficient and less polluting to go solar over fossil fuels. Considering [researchers estimated that exposure to particulate matter from fossil fuel emissions accounted for 18 percent of total global deaths in 2018 (which is 8 million people, a little less than 1 out of 5)](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/news/2021/02/deaths-fossil-fuel-emissions-higher-previously-thought) I’d say that solar is still by far a winner. Panels are getting more sophisticated, less expensive, more effective, and more recyclable every year. Their recyclability is so much of an easier problem to fix than the carnage fossil fuels creates every day. 

I’m sorry if I’m being aggressive. Protecting the environment is literally job and a moral obligation of mine. It’s so sad to see people fall the blatant misinformation. A lot of politicians, at every level, are paid off by the fossil fuel industry. They play dirty and want to do things that they know will hurt us all. It is in your best personal health interests as well as all of our best interests about the climate to help end our utter dependence on fossil fuels.

The reason why?  The dam is obsolete.  It used to be used by a power plant upstream for cooling (Ohio Edison) -- that power plant was removed many years ago.  It also was used for hydroelectric power until 1958.  Now all the dam does is impede the river and degrade water quality.

I mentioned in a comment above that we now have White Pelicans that have been coming back to our area the past few years (north Ohio, along the Lake Erie shoreline), and if you look at their range in bird books or the Merlin app, they aren't native to the area. Last year we had a Brown Booby near Akron after one of the hurricanes (I do think this one was displaced by one). Last year we had a Snowy Owl come down at the beginning of November, and while they aren't totally rare to see here, seeing them in November is crazy early. The past few years we have had a few Painted Buntings up here during spring migration. There was a Northern Wheatear in the northern Ohio area early this year as well, and if you don't know what those are, they are absolutely not native to this area. We had Piping Plovers nest up here for the first time in 80 years.


Something is definitely going on to cause us to see birds like this more frequently. We have had a massive comeback in Bald Eagle population here and we are on a major flyway for migration, so birds are never on short supply here. It doesn't explain what is going on with sightings like the Spoonbill though. I wonder if there will be studies done regarding the movement of these birds.",0

&gt;“Biodegradable” lanterns made of bamboo take decades to break down, and can injure or entrap animals in the meantime. They can also start dangerous fires. More than 30 animals died in Germany after floating lanterns started a fire inside a local zoo.

&gt;Sky lantern fires endanger people as well.

&gt;In 2013, a sky lantern ignited a fire in The West Midlands, UK that injured 13 of the 200 firefighters who responded to the blaze and created £6m in damage.
Sky lanterns have caused flight delays at major airports in China, Thailand and other countries. Just one lantern could take down a plane if it got sucked into a jet engine.
Many countries ban sky lanterns, including: Argentina, Austria, Australia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Germany, New Zealand, and Spain. Twenty-nine US states ban sky lanterns as do some parts of Canada.

&gt;Wales have banned sky lanterns on all council land since 2018, but they remain legal in England and Scotland. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA), Marine Conservation Society and other groups urge concerned citizens to contact their MP.

On a more extreme scale- does anyone remember the incident of [""Balloonfest '86""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZmTPk0_4UA)? 

&gt;Balloonfest '86 was a 1986 event in Cleveland, Ohio, United States, in which the local chapter of United Way set a world record by **releasing almost one-and-a-half million balloons**.[2] The event was intended to be a harmless fundraising publicity stunt, but the balloons drifted back over the city, Lake Erie, and landed in the surrounding area, causing problems for traffic and a nearby airport. The event also interfered with a United States Coast Guard search for two boaters who were later found drowned.[1] In consequence, the organizers and the city faced lawsuits seeking millions of dollars in damages,[1] and cost overruns put the event at a net loss.[3]",0

Here is a statement from the water treatment group 

Late last week, Lake Erie experienced a considerable thermocline inversion causing the lake water to “turn over”. This brought up water with very low oxygen levels from the deeper part of the lake to the surface. Coupled with a constant wind and storms over the weekend, this has caused a number of issues including sizable fish-kills, algal die-off, increased amounts of manganese in the raw water, strong odor, and high turbidity (cloudiness) in the raw lake water. This water is very difficult to treat and has affected nearly all water treatment facilities on Lake Erie, especially those in the central basin.

First, we would like to take this opportunity to assure you that the treated water supplied to the area municipalities continues to meet the stringent water quality standards established by Ontario Regulation. The water system’s contracted operating authority, the Ontario Clean Water Agency, has been working diligently to ensure the treated water quality continues meet the drinking water standards; however, some consumers may notice a change in the appearance and taste of the water as a result.

To address the low oxygen levels and higher manganese content, the water treatment plant has made some temporary operational changes to address the current circumstances. These include an increase in chlorine levels to compensate for the higher-than-normal chlorine demand and ensure adequate disinfection prior to the supply of water to area municipalities, as well as increased the use of powder activated carbon to combat the strong taste/odors associated with the event.

The supply of water from the Elgin Area Water System to the City of London has been temporarily discontinued to allow the water treatment facility to address these very challenging raw water conditions at lower flow rates.

Our counterparts along the north shore of Lake Erie continue to struggle with these conditions, many in much worse circumstances that what we’re experiencing. The lake conditions have slowly but continually improved somewhat from the initial onset of the event late last week, but it will likely be well into the week before we return to more normal conditions.

Our treatment plant operations staff have been keeping our counterparts in the various municipal water operations advised throughout this event and will continue to do so until the issue has returned to more normal conditions.

Consumers are encouraged to contact your local municipality should you experience any issues with the drinking water supplied to your residence or business.

Oh I see they have an additional statement 
By mid-week, conditions on Lake Erie continue to improve and raw water quality has started to return to more-normal conditions. While dissolved oxygen levels in the raw water continue to improve, they remain at below-normal levels. 

The treated water from the Elgin Area water treatment plant has significantly improved, with pH returning to normal conditions. The plant continues to dose higher rates of powder activated carbon to mitigate issues with taste and odour. 

The supply of drinking water to the City of London from the Elgin Area Water System was restarted earlier this week, but at lower daily volumes than normal. The City of London continues to be primarily supplied from the Lake Huron Water Supply System as normal.

Questions or concerns from consumers about the supply of drinking water from their municipal water distribution system should contact their local municipality.",0

Also look up BMPs for storm water. You might end up mapping a lot of those. BMPs are Best Management Practices, like making new developments build storm water retention ponds so all their runoff doesn’t flood the existing community downhill from them.

My background is in geoscience; I can't help but see Earth as one interconnected system. I often forget that's not true for everyone.

So let me try again.

**TL;DR**: The source of your water is less of a problem than what happens when you're done with it. The less used water that flows forth from your lawn, the fewer serious problems downstream.

Without knowing exactly where you are, I can't dig in to find out the details of your watershed, so this is necessarily going to come across as a bit vague and/or generic.

I see two major ways in which watering your (presumed) monoculture lawn is problematic: one close to home and one much farther away.

Watering from your local Great Lake isn't ideal--far better to plant a variety of native things which can thrive in your climate zone without extra irrigation--but the real problem is what comes off your lawn. A monoculture grass lawn can't absorb much of a major rain or snowmelt event, particularly if the water table is already high. What it can't use becomes stormwater runoff, which carries pollutants from your lawn and any pavement it touches into storm drains. The storm drains, in turn, feed the local waterways, which feed the Lakes and the rivers. 

I don't know which of the Lakes you're on, but [here's](https://www.ijc.org/en/green-without-envy-great-lakes-drown-excessive-nutrient-pollution) a bit about nutrient--that is, fertilizer--pollution in Lake Erie which gives a bit of insight into why that's problematic: fish die-offs, potential freshwater supply disruption, and potential vectors of disease for humans and birds.

The farther from home part depends on your watershed situation. IF there's a river that your watershed feeds, odds are that that river flows into the Mississippi, which flows into the Gulf of Mexico. The runoff from your lawn (hypothetically) contributes to runoff from other lawns and agricultural operations all the way downstream to the Gulf, where it contributes to a nutrient pollution issue which negatively impacts the Gulf's ecosystem and the people who make their living from it.

The reason it's best to keep as much rainwater as we can where it falls is that it minimizes such problematic runoff.",0

Texas is by far the most polluted state currently. They don't believe in regulation of pollution, claim its communism.

Prosecutors filed a deferred prosecution agreement against the company in U.S. District Court in Cincinnati. FirstEnergy is charged with conspiracy to commit honest services fraud involving what authorities called the largest bribery scandal in Ohio history.



Court filings list payments the company made to then-Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder and Samuel Randazzo, the former chairman of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio.



Neither is named, though the descriptions from the document make it clear Householder and Randazzo are the officials involved in the case. The agreement calls for the company to pay $115 million within 60 days to the U.S. Treasury.



It also must pay $115 million to the Ohio Development Service Agency’s percentage of income payment plan plus program for the benefit of Ohio electric-utility customers, according to the agreement.



“If the Ohio Development Service Agency’s percentage of income payment plan plus program is unable or unwilling to accept the funds, FirstEnergy Corp. shall pay the $115 million to the United States Treasury,” the document says.



Steven Sozio and James Wooley, two partners with Jones Day in Cleveland and former organized crime prosecutors, are representing FirstEnergy.



Emily Glatfelter and Matthew Singer, the federal prosecutors handling the House Bill 6 investigation, also dealt with the FirstEnergy agreement. Prosecutors and the FBI are expected to detail the charge in a press conference later this morning.



Coincidentally, FirstEnergy is hosting its second-quarter earnings call Friday morning.



In April, the company announced that it had begun working with federal prosecutors in Cincinnati on an agreement, which allows companies to pay large fines and cooperate to avoid criminal charges.



Last year, federal prosecutors accused FirstEnergy of paying more than $60 million in bribes to Householder and four allies to pass House Bill 6, which offered a $1 billion bailout of two aging nuclear plants off Lake Erie.



Householder, his strategist Jeffrey Longstreth and lobbyists Neil Clark, Juan Cespedes and Matthew Borges were indicted on racketeering charges. Cespedes and Longstreth have pleaded guilty. Clark died March 15 of suicide.



Householder and Borges have denied the charges, and they are expected to go to trial next year.



Federal authorities said FirstEnergy and an affiliate funneled the $60 million through a nonprofit prosecutors said Householder secretly controlled. The money went toward helping Householder gain his leadership position and to help push the bill into law.



It’s not uncommon for corporations facing criminal charges to enter into deferred prosecution agreements to avoid being charged. Commonwealth Edison Company, an Illinois utility, entered into one in 2020 to settle bribery allegations, agreeing to pay a $200 million fine.



Simultaneously, the Justice Department filed a single criminal charge against ComEd, agreeing to dismiss it after three years if the company fully cooperated with its investigation.",0

The concentration of 'pins' around Point Pelee/Leamington was just a solid black mass, then you see it migrating and thinning out along the shoreline and moving north and inland. This was about ten years ago, when we took our dog in with a huge bloated tick stuck to its lip. We'd never encountered one before (this was in the GTHA) but in the ensuing years they've become more and more common and these days, since we're daily hikers on nature trails, it's almost a daily occurrence to find a tick or two on us after a hike - especially in late Spring/early Summer.

 &gt;The Cuyahoga River ( KY-ə-HOG-ə, or  KY-ə-HOH-gə ) is a river in the United States, located in Northeast Ohio, that bisects the City of Cleveland and feeds into Lake Erie. As Cleveland emerged as a major manufacturing center, the river became heavily affected by industrial pollution, so much so that it ""caught fire"" at least 13 times, most famously on June 22, 1969, helping to spur the American environmental movement. Since then, the river has been extensively cleaned up through the efforts of Cleveland's city government and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA).

Personal/anecdotal life experience - have lived most of my life in northeastern Ohio/ Western PA. I was born mid 1980's - growing up, any outdoor water recreation was pools, manmade lakes, and natural lakes used for drinking water. The areas river systems and Lake Erie were still just fucked. 

I forget when it changed from ""it's not safe to eat fish from Lake Erie"" to like ""You can eat like 2 fish from Lake Erie a month without consuming dangerous amounts of mercury""... but yeah - that was totally a thing, and not that long ago.

Honestly at one point I think everything everywhere in this area was just one giant steel mill - hell - one of the Cuyahoga River's (many) fires served as a rallying cry for increasing social interest in environmentalism that led to the creation of the EPA.

EPA superfund sites are the first example of cleanup done well I'd like to toss out there - in the interest of brevity - [their list of completed projects is cool](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-success-stories). 

As to the river systems in this area - the transformation just in my lifetime is hard to believe - wasn't just the Cuyahoga that caught fire - river fires were common all over the place. Mahoning River burned a number of times... In my childhood like our parents would say don't swim in them - but even as kids &amp; kids do dumb shit was unnecessary, many still looked, just awful - I mean they were dead in many places still. Today?most all are safe/clean/thriving and used for recreation now.

The ingredients for successful cleanup are simple - both the superfund sites &amp; the smaller efforts to clean up area waterways that have been shockingly effective  follow basically the same pattern.

Bring the polluter, environmentalist to serve to keep polluter honest, some level of government to serve as the enforcement mechanism &amp; possible partial source of funding, and the situationally appropriate scientists - who take baseline samples to establish problem, a system to monitor the problem, and what the target goals for these are the numbers needed for the biome to recover to the point it's functional again, and what the numbers need to be for the effort to be considered complete &amp; successful. 

Don't leave the table till there's a plan for how to extract pollutants, a plan for how it's being paid for. A plan for how monitoring will work and penalties for non compliance. One those are agreed upon it just takes time 

In my lifetime I've watched that turn dead, disgusting, dangerous rivers polluted beyond comprehension for 100+ years of industry that treated them like trashcan in my 35ish years of paying attention to them. Which - pretty wild if you think about it - most of that time was spent getting things to the point where the ecosystem could return to minimal functionality - once that happened the pace of cleanup increased exponentially, nature is really good at cleaning up after us when not totally fucking broken.",2

I dont know if all this applies or is what you're looking for, but the biggest change I've seen in my lifetime is visible, undeniable evidence of climate change. No longer do we have mild dry summers. It's so hot and humid. Also the amount of storms that produce flooding are increasing drastically, especially in Niagara County and around Chautauqua county, coming off Lake Erie. Shoreline erosion on Lake Ontario is also increasing in severity.
Lake Erie takes longer and longer to freeze over, increasing the likelihood of more intense lake effect snow events and likely having effects of the lakes ecosystem. 
There's also been an strong uptick of invasive species(plant and animal) in the last 5ish years. I've watched it kill, choke out and change our landscape.

Some 25,000,000 cows, chickens and pigs are now confined in factory “farms,” or more accurately, animal feeding factories.

They choke on noxious fumes of their own waste, are crowded together making antibiotic-laced feed necessary to prevent disease and live a miserable existence no sentient creature should have to endure.  Just one side effect of this system is the rising occurrence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Small wonder when 80% of antibiotic usage in the U.S. is in animal feed and 98% of meat eaten in this country is produced in these factories.

Something else happens in these enormous sheds located behind earth berms or set back far from the road that military veterans will recognize.

Wouldn't we be suffering aggravated pollution from unchecked ""capitalist greed""?  
There is, first of all, this stark empirical fact: Government ownership, even socialism, has proved to be no solution to the problem of pollution. Even the most starry-eyed proponents of government planning concede that the poisoning of Lake Baikal in the Soviet Union is a monument to heedless industrial pollution of a valuable natural resource. But there is far more to the problem than that. Note, for example, the two crucial areas in which pollution has become an important problem: the air and the waterways, particularly the rivers. But these are precisely two of the vital areas in society in which private property has not been permitted to function.  
First, the rivers. The rivers, and the oceans too, are generally owned by the government; private property, certainly complete private property, has not been permitted in the water. In essence, then, government owns the rivers. But government ownership is not true ownership, because the government officials, while able to control the resource cannot themselves reap their capital value on the market. Government officials cannot sell the rivers or sell stock in them. Hence, they have no economic incentive to preserve the purity and value of the rivers. Rivers are, then, in the economic sense, ""unowned""; therefore government officials have permitted their corruption and pollution. Anyone has been able to dump polluting garbage and wastes in the waters. But consider what would happen if private firms were able to own the rivers and the lakes. If a private firm owned Lake Erie, for example, then anyone dumping garbage in the lake would be promptly sued in the courts for their aggression against private property and would be forced by the courts to pay damages and to cease and desist from any further aggression. Thus, only private property rights will insure an end to pollution — invasion of resources. Only because the rivers are unowned is there no owner to rise up and defend his precious resource from attack. If, in contrast, anyone should dump garbage or pollutants into a lake which is privately owned (as are many smaller lakes), he would not be permitted to do so for very long — the owner would come roaring to its defense.

It’s a domino line of problems creating other problems and potentially dangerous situations.

You don’t see the conflict there at all maybe even a little? They don’t give a rats ass if the food they grow is healthy all they care about is money. It’s practically a monopoly with the agriculture companies but these companies have big money ties with big corporate brands and politicians so it goes on, just like a lot of other things that are corrupt in this country. A huge portion of people who hunt hunt because they want clean organic food. What’s the point of hunting when the game we pursue is no longer organic from grazing gmo and spray filled fields and drinking water from streams and ponds with glyphosate in it. There’s better, cleaner and safer ways to deal with weeds in a field than spraying glyphosate all over. I live right on Lake Erie. The agriculture run off is the #1 detriment to the Great Lakes right now. The glyphosate contains phosphorus it gets into the water a toxic algae feeds off it and thrives suffocates the fish and has tainted drinking water. Even if glyphosate didn’t have an effect on the deer you couldn’t convince me it’s a good thing to use for human safety and natural resource purposes. I live with the first hand negative effects every day.

&gt; Cleveland, OH was once known as a major industrial center within the United States.  As the 1960s came to an end, so did the country's reliance on industrialized manufacturing.  However, Cleveland continued production which when paired with a lack in sewer and waste disposal regulation maintained the littering of the Cuyahoga River.  On June 22, 1969, around 12pm, floating pieces of oil slicked debris were ignited on the river by sparks caused by a passing train.  Specifically, following an investigation, the cause was determined to be the oily debris trapped beneath two wooden trestles, rigid support frames, located around the Campbell Rd. hill in Southeast Cleveland.  The fire was determined to have reached heights of over five stories and lasted between twenty and thirty minutes.  There was reported to be around $50,000 of damages including: $45,000 from the destruction of the bridge owned by Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Co. and $5,000 from the Newburgh &amp; South Shore Railway trestle. 

&gt; The Cuyahoga River was once one of the most polluted rivers in the United States as represented by the multitude of times it has caught fire, a recorded number of thirteen starting in 1868.  The most potent blaze occurred in 1952 which caused over $1.3 million in damages however, the most fatal fire happened in 1912 with a documented five deaths.  The 1969 fire, which did not incur maximum damages or fatally wound any citizen, was the most covered incident occuring on the river.  This was in part because of the developing precedence that sanitation held over industrial actions; the United States was becoming more eco-aware.  Also, due to the shift from industry to technology, waste dumping to recycling Time Magazine produced an article about the incident.  This brought mass amount of attention to the Cleveland area and added pressure for hygienic regulation.

&gt; Inspired by the 1969 river fire, Congress was determined to resolve the issue of land pollution, not just in Cleveland, but throughout the United States.  The legislature passed the National Environment Policy Act (NEPA) which was signed into law on January 1, 1970.  This act helped establish the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) which would be given the duties to manage environmental risks and regulate various sanitary-specific policies.  One of the first legislations that the EPA put-forth was the Clean Water Act (1972), which mandated that all rivers throughout the United States be hygienic enough to safely allow mass amounts of swimmers and fish within the water by 1983.  Since the 1969 Cuyahoga River fire the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District has invested over $3.5 billion towards the purification of the river and the development of new sewer systems.  There is a projection that over the next thirty years the city of Cleveland will further endow over $5 billion to the upkeep of the wastewater system.  The river is now home to about sixty different species of fish, there has not been another river fire since 1969, and yearly new waste management programs develop to ensure the sanitation of Cleveland's waterways.

 &gt;The Cuyahoga River ( KY-ə-HOG-ə, or  KY-ə-HOH-gə ) is a river in the United States, located in Northeast Ohio, that bisects the City of Cleveland and feeds into Lake Erie. As Cleveland emerged as a major manufacturing center, the river became heavily affected by industrial pollution, so much so that it ""caught fire"" at least 13 times, most famously on June 22, 1969, helping to spur the American environmental movement. Since then, the river has been extensively cleaned up through the efforts of Cleveland's city government and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA).

The potential threat to humans occurs after oxygen is depleted. At that point, the chemistry changes and anoxic chemical reactions occur that often release nutrients like phosphorus from lake sediments. That fuels algal blooms, and, when nutrients are high enough and other conditions are correct, harmful algal blooms. These harmful algal blooms are toxic to humans and wildlife. 

As an example, Lake Erie regularly goes anoxic (zero oxygen) in its deep waters each summer. The lake also gets some pretty serious harmful algal blooms. The city of Toledo, OH, had to shut down the drinking water intake to \~400,000 people a few years ago due to high toxins from the harmful algal blooms in the lake. So there can be a human health impact, but it is not from low oxygen in the water. It is from the knock-on effects that occur after oxygen is depleted.

The lake, it is said, never gives up her dead
When the skies of November turn gloomy
With a load of iron ore twenty-six thousand tons more
Than the Edmund Fitzgerald weighed empty
That good ship and true was a bone to be chewed
When the gales of November came early

The ship was the pride of the American side
Coming back from some mill in Wisconsin
As the big freighters go, it was bigger than most
With a crew and good captain well seasoned
Concluding some terms with a couple of steel firms
When they left fully loaded for Cleveland
And later that night when the ship's bell rang
Could it be the north wind they'd been feelin'?

The wind in the wires made a tattle-tale sound
And a wave broke over the railing
And every man knew, as the captain did too
T'was the witch of November come stealin'
The dawn came late and the breakfast had to wait
When the gales of November came slashin'
When afternoon came it was freezin' rain
In the face of a hurricane west wind

When suppertime came, the old cook came on deck sayin'
""Fellas, it's too rough to feed ya""
At seven PM, a main hatchway caved in, he said
""Fellas, it's been good to know ya""
The captain wired in he had water comin' in
And the good ship and crew was in peril
And later that night when his lights went outta sight
Came the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald

Does any one know where the love of God goes
When the waves turn the minutes to hours?
The searchers all say they'd have made Whitefish Bay
If they'd put fifteen more miles behind her
They might have split up or they might have capsized
They may have broke deep and took water
And all that remains is the faces and the names
Of the wives and the sons and the daughters

Lake Huron rolls, Superior sings
In the rooms of her ice-water mansion
Old Michigan steams like a young man's dreams
The islands and bays are for sportsmen
And farther below Lake Ontario
Takes in what Lake Erie can send her
And the iron boats go as the mariners all know
With the gales of November remembered

In a musty old hall in Detroit they prayed
In the maritime sailors' cathedral
The church bell chimed 'til it rang twenty-nine times
For each man on the Edmund Fitzgerald
The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down
Of the big lake they called Gitche Gumee

&gt; The threat to avian wildlife from nuclear power plants can be divided into upstream and downstream fatalities.

&gt; Upstream, uranium milling and mining can poison and kill hundreds of birds per facility per year. Abandoned open pit uranium mines in Wyoming have formed lakes hazardous to wildlife. Uranium-bearing formations are usually associated with strata containing high concentrations of selenium. For example, one of these pits killed 300 birds during a single year (US Fish and Wildlife Service 2008). Presuming this rate stayed constant, deaths at this mine therefore correlate to about 0.45 deaths per GWh.

&gt; Like fossil-fueled power stations and wind farms, avian fauna can also collide with nuclear power plants. Three thousand birds died in two successive nights in 1982 from collisions with cooling towers at Florida Power Corporation's Crystal River Generating Facility (Maehr et al. 1983). Given that the power plant now hosts an 838-MW nuclear reactor, and presuming it operated with a capacity factor of 90% and that the 3000 deaths were the only ones throughout the year, the facility was responsible for 0.454 avian deaths per GWh. Ornithologists observed 274 fatal bird collisions with an elevated cooling tower at the Limerick nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania from 1979 to 1980 (Veltri and Klem 2005). Since the Limerick plant has a 1200-MW reactor, and also assuming it operated at a 90% capacity factor, it was responsible for 0.261 deaths per GWh. At the Susquehanna plant in eastern Pennsylvania, 1500 dead birds were collected between 1978 and 1986 for an average of 187 fatalities per year (Biewald 2005). Assuming that the 2200 MW plant operated at 90% capacity factor, it was responsible for 0.01 deaths per GWh. Extensive surveys for dead birds were also conducted at the Davis-Bess nuclear plant near Lake Erie in Northern Ohio. Ornithologists recorded a total of 1554 bird fatalities or an average of 196 per year from 1972 to 1979 (Biewald 2005). Given that the power plant hosts an 873-MW reactor, and assuming it operated with a 90% capacity factor, and the plant was responsible for 0.0285 fatalities per GWh. Taking the mean for each of the four power plants results in 0.188 deaths per GWh.

&gt; The total avian deaths per GWh for nuclear power plants are therefore about 0.638.",0

&gt; The Biden administration is set to toss out President Donald Trump’s efforts to scale back the number of streams, marshes and other wetlands that fall under federal protection, kicking off a legal and regulatory scuffle over the fate of wetlands and waterways around the country, from the arid West to the swampy South.

&gt; Michael Regan, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, said his team determined that the Trump administration’s rollback is “leading to significant environmental degradation.” The EPA and Army Corps of Engineers will now craft a new set of protections for waterways that provide habitats for wildlife and safe drinking water for millions of Americans, according to a joint statement.

&gt; With the announcement, the Biden administration is wading into a decades-long battle over how far federal officials can go to stop contaminants from entering small streams and other wetlands.

&gt; “Communities deserve to have our nation’s waters protected,” said Jaime A. Pinkham, acting assistant secretary of the Army for civil works.

&gt; In 2015, the Obama administration expanded federal authority to stop or curtail development that could harm a variety of wetlands, streams and ditches that feed into larger bodies of water protected under the Clean Water Act.

&gt; Heeding the call of home developers, oil drillers and growers who saw the restrictions as detrimental to their livelihoods, the Trump administration rolled back those Obama-era pollution controls.

&gt; But critics, including a panel of independent scientists picked by the Trump administration itself, slammed the move for potentially hastening the destruction of waterways, including “ephemeral” streams that appear only after rainfall and help purify water on its way to larger lakes and rivers that serve as sources of drinking water for millions of Americans. The current lack of protections is particularly notable in dry states such as New Mexico and Arizona, the EPA said.

&gt; “The science says those streams and these wetlands are an important part of our clean-water system in the United States and should be protected,” said Tom Kiernan, head of American Rivers, a conservation group.

&gt; Now, Regan says he’s trying to strike the delicate balance between conservation and development that both the Trump and Obama administrations failed to reach.

&gt; “We’ve learned lessons from both, we’ve seen complexities in both, and we’ve determined both rules did not necessarily listen to the will of the people,” Regan told House lawmakers in April.

&gt; The Biden administration’s rulemaking could help stem the staggering loss of wetlands.

&gt; Since the end of the Revolutionary War, more than half of the 221 million acres of wetlands in what would become the contiguous United States have been drained, often for farming. The rate of destruction began to wane only in recent decades.

&gt; In northwest Ohio, for instance, corn and other crops are grown on a vast tract once known as the Great Black Swamp. Farmers began draining it during the 19th century, and now agricultural runoff flows into Lake Erie and feeds the growth of toxic algae that regularly closes beaches and once forced the city of Toledo to suspend tap water use for about two days.

&gt; Bill Stanley, state director of the Nature Conservancy in Ohio, said the Trump administration’s withdrawal of federal protections for what few streams remain to filter nutrient waste from fertilizers could make the lake susceptible to even bigger algae blooms.

&gt; “ ‘Nutrients’ doesn’t sound like a bad word,” he said, “but when you get too many of them, it causes major problems for our water quality in Ohio.”

&gt; But farmers such as Daryl Lies, who raises hogs and sheep and grows vegetables on 160 acres in central North Dakota, say the Obama-era restrictions on wetland development would have been “painstakingly costly for agriculture.” Those rules, he said, “would have made it a lot harder to have the livestock” near a creek that winds along his farm on its way to the Missouri River.

&gt; “Farmers and ranchers are the original environmentalists, I say,” said Lies, who heads the North Dakota Farm Bureau. “We’re not the activists, like we hear across the nation, but we are the real environmentalists. We care about taking care of our land and having it there for the next generation.”

&gt; The Trump-era rule eased the path for several construction projects, including a commercial, industrial and residential park along the Savannah River, which forms the border between South Carolina and Georgia.

&gt; The RiverPort project came with the promise of jobs in shipping and construction. But wildlife officials at the nearby Savannah National Wildlife Refuge warned in 2010 the proposal “represents a significant threat” to its bottomland hardwoods of gum and maple trees and freshwater marshes that attract migrating waterfowl.

&gt; Yet after the Trump administration rolled back the Obama-era rule, more than 200 acres of the wetlands in the project’s footprint fell out of federal oversight, according to the Southern Environmental Law Center, which is suing the EPA over the regulation.

&gt; “Every day the rule is in place, we are losing protections for 92 percent of wetlands, waters and streams,” said Kelly Moser, a senior attorney at the Charlottesville-based legal advocacy group, citing the organization’s analysis of the impact of the Trump rule.

&gt; In total, the EPA and Army Corps said they are aware of 333 projects that no longer require federal water permits under the Trump rule.

&gt; A former regulator from the purple state of North Carolina, Regan arrived in Washington with a reputation as a consensus builder and has spent much of his first months in office listening to both sides of the debate over water protections. Lies was among several people in North Dakota’s agriculture and oil industries Regan met with last week on a trip to Bismarck hosted by Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.).

&gt; “I’m cautiously optimistic that we’ll be able to work with this EPA administrator and that he truly is sincere about getting out and getting input,” Lies said.

&gt; But the fate of the EPA’s effort ultimately will hang in the U.S. Supreme Court.

&gt; At the center of the decades-long legal storm over water protections is the Clean Water Act, which bans pollution in a “waters of the United States” without a permit. The question of what constitutes such water has been up for debate since the law’s passage in 1972.

&gt; In a 2006 decision, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote federal officials could step in when there was a “significant nexus” between smaller and larger bodies of water. The Obama administration wrote its rule around that standard.

&gt; With the announcement Wednesday, the Biden administration is kicking off a lengthy rulemaking process. It must first strike down the Trump rule before setting its own definition for which waterways get federal protection.

&gt; But after Kennedy’s retirement and with the Supreme Court taking an even more conservative turn with the appointments of three justices by Trump, it’s unclear what sort of rule could now pass muster.

&gt; “That is the $64 million question, isn’t it?” said Patrick Parenteau, a professor of natural resources law at Vermont Law School. “It’s got to be a rule that gets five votes on the Supreme Court, and that’s going to be … difficult.”

 &gt;The Cuyahoga River ( KY-ə-HOG-ə, or  KY-ə-HOH-gə ) is a river in the United States, located in Northeast Ohio, that bisects the city of Cleveland and feeds into Lake Erie. As Cleveland emerged as a major center for manufacturing, the river became heavily affected by industrial pollution, so much so that it ""caught fire"" at least 13 times, most famously on June 22, 1969, helping to spur the American environmental movement. Since then, the river has been extensively cleaned up through the efforts of Cleveland's city government and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA).

I've been a water-man my whole life, very tragic to see all death and destruction.

The lagoon system from Martin County to Volusia County is a sewer on the east coast. It's all dying or dead already.

The Everglades are dying from lack of freshwater, and always at risk from development or gas/oil exploration. 

Lake Okeechobee is completely polluted by Big Sugar and pollutes the waters it empties into. On the east coast, it's the St. Lucie River. On the west coast, it's the Caloosahatchee River. Those surrounding areas on the coasts see fish kills, death of ecosystems and poisonous algae blooms. 

Red tide shows up on the Gulf Coast every year from summer to fall, but warm temperatures can see red tide continue into the winter months too. And it stays and lingers in the Gulf because of the lack of circulation (currents) in the Gulf of Mexico in these areas. Like a giant bathtub.

The answers to these major problems are known. Florida's Republican leadership will never commit to solving these problems. This is why I've stopped voting for Republicans completely. The Republican party forced me to the left, back in the day I was a ""centrist"". They forced me to vote exclusively about water. I'm always looking for any politician willing to clean up our waters. 

(Also, I found religion after a decade away from the church, which pushed me away from Republicans, but that's another story.)

Major problems:

Unregulated major development along every beach, every wetland, every lake, ever pond, every river, every puddle, ever retention pond, every stream, every creek, every spring

Dumping fertilizers into our waterways. Stop using fertilizer! Just flat out stop buying it or using it.

Spraying herbicides or pesticides near water. Just stop spraying. If weeds are really taking over a waterway, find another method to remove them. Manually remove it. Have an entrepreneurial capitalist come in here and figure out a great manual method to remove weeds choking out a pond or lake. They could make a fortune.

Big Sugar polluting Lake Okeechobee and estuaries on the coast with their agriculture runoff. If you're familiar with Lake Erie up north, they see something similar too ([https://greatlakes.org/campaigns/lake-erie-algae-blooms/](https://greatlakes.org/campaigns/lake-erie-algae-blooms/))

Blocking the freshwater flow of the water from Lake Okeechobee to the Everglades. Everglades needs the freshwater to survive. Everglades was known as the River of Grass ... well, let that ""river"" exist again from Lake O to the Everglades!

Septic tanks near waterways leaching their actual poop into our waterways. This is a huge issue. ALL houses and businesses near any waterway need to be on city water, so their poop and pee goes to a water cleaning station, not into our waterways. This will take major infrastructure upgrades.

Outdated infrastructure that handles poop and pee, breaking and leaking nastiness into our waterways. This will take major infrastructure upgrades.

Removing the layers of muck at the bottom of our waterways. When seagrass or plants die, they fall to the bottom and create muck. This muck prevents new growth of plants. Clear waterways turn off colored because the muck doubles as silt in our waters. Silted waters make it hard for seagrass and plants and oysters to grow.

In general, stop this hyper growth and development killing our waters and green areas. Cap growth. Force developers to help pay for infrastructure upgrades. Infrastructure needs to catch up, and at this point I don't care how it gets done.

For the rest of my life, I will vote water and vote green. And I'm seeing a growing movement among Floridians to finally recognize our dying environment needs major help. Florida's environment is what makes Florida unique.

Even the most selfish ahole with a multi million dollar estate on the water has to recognize the importance of cleaning up our waterways. You can't enjoy that river you live on if it's toxic from algae blooms. You can't swim or boat in it if it's bad for your health. And you can't sell your house if the waterway it sits on is destroyed.",0
t1_h2otj1x,scuba,2021-06,2021-06-22 20:01:23,1,B,"Zebra Mussels are an invasive species brought to the great lakes from a freighter who dropped their ballast water in Lake st. Clair (between erie and huron). Once they had a foothold there was zero species here who ate / could eat them and they quickly flourished. They seemed like a great thing at the time, but quickly we started noticing them, a few at a time on decks of ships, or the wheels etc. Then very quickly they coated the shallow wrecks and made the into just lumps of mussels on the bottom with zero wood to be found.

At one point the Canadian Government paid to start having some of the wrecks surveyed and I was one of the lucky few that was able to be part of that group, few free dive weekends, lots of cool ships and lots of measurements. Those ships have since disappeared under many feet of zebra mussels. At one point I heard an estimate that the mussels in lake Erie were were over 10 feet deep in the deepest parts of that lake (shallowest of the great lakes, about 160 - 190' I think). They made their way north and east. The last time I dove at depth they had started to coat some of those wrecks as well.  We are talking fairly deep too.

So they introduced Gobbi fish (think that's the spelling) because the government thought, hey why not bring another foreign invasive species to the waters that have zero natural enemies and hope.. HOPE..they eat the zebra mussels, well they didn't turns out the zebra mussels weren't as tasty as our mussels or our bait fish, the gobbi's thrived along side of our zebra mussels and now the ecosystem of the great lakes is fairly well messed up.

if I sound angry, I am. It has been nothing short of a disaster, destroying the ecosystem was bad enough, as in, really bad. But it destroyed most water sports in the great lakes, you would never want to walk on the bottom freely anymore as your feet might get cut into a bloody mess.

I tried long beach after so many people recommended it, but was not impressed. Super rocky, the water wasn't nice or clean. People were loading their boats in right at the beach so that made it loud and not natural and overall it had a real trailer trash vibe. It wasn't a nice sandy spot, it was small and grassy and kind of gross. 

Nickel beach is also nice, you can drive your car right on and I dig that, very American northeast ocean beach vibes. Super clear water, and it's got lots of sand bars so you can venture out pretty far. You need day passes tho, and you pay en entry fee to park.

t1_h3ewxea,environment,2021-06,2021-06-29 06:47:20,1,B,"The article:

With a vast portion of the United States coping with exceptional drought this summer, conditions are ripe in many places for harmful algal blooms, bringing additional threats to already-stressed water systems and increased health risks for communities.

The blooms are in large part fueled by phosphorus and nitrogen runoff from industrial agricultural operations, which provide a feast of nutrients for cyanobacteria — a group of aquatic, photosynthetic bacteria that grow out of control and overwhelm their ecosystems in the presence of excess nutrients.

To protect humans and animals from potentially lethal effects of the blooms, officials have closed beaches in Wisconsin and temporarily shuttered shellfish harvesting in Florida. Annual blooms in Oregon have contributed to what has become a full-blown water war at the California border.

To the possible relief of residents living in parts of Ohio, Michigan and Ontario, many of whom have come to intimately know the telltale stench and economic impacts that wash up when a toxic soup of algae blankets the water, scientists with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) have predicted a lower-than-average algal bloom in Lake Erie this year.

But a growing body of environmental health research links harmful algal blooms across the world to chronic health conditions spurred by microcystin: a kind of cyanobacteria linked to liver failure and increasingly, cancer. Some residents in downstream communities who have lived through past algal bloom-spurred water crises are still bracing for the worst.

Alicia Smith is executive director of The Junction Coalition, a neighborhood organization focused on social, environmental, economic and peace education that formed in response to the Toledo, Ohio, water crisis in 2014, which left 500,000 people without drinking water. “Seven years later we still hold our breath wondering if in July, August and September we will get a notification that we can’t drink, touch or bathe in the water,” Smith told Truthout.

Smith estimates that a majority of community members in her area in Toledo, known as the Junction neighborhood, were not aware of dangerous levels of microcystin in the water at the time. “We had to get football players and basketball players from our local schools to help canvas and drop off water,” she said.

Since then, in an attempt to avoid another algal bloom-fueled water crisis, a new regional commission has planned to invest in improvements to its water treatment facilities, including a $100 million new water intake system and $70 million water towers, as the Toledo Blade reported. But the cost is being passed off on city residents, whom the Blade estimated would pay double the cost of 2019 water prices by 2025.

For many Toledo residents, those prices are prompting an affordability crisis, Smith said, noting that residents still worry that water flowing through the tap may be making family members sick.

A Burst in Blooms?

Algal blooms are nothing new. According to a June article in Nature, Japanese explorers reported “red waters,” known now as “red tides,” as early as the year 731. But agricultural runoff from industrial farms and lawns and a lapse in limits and enforcement around nutrient runoff may be leading to bigger blooms. Research by the United Nations Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission has suggested that the harm caused by blooms strongly correlates with the growth of the aquaculture industry.

The tame 2021 NOAA prediction for Lake Erie is based in part on lower-than-average March and April rains this year, which brought minimal phosphorus discharge. Hans W. Paerl, a professor at the University of North Carolina Institute of Marine Sciences, told Truthout that, at the end of the day, the NOAA algal bloom forecast is only a prediction. After a dry early spring, May and June ended up bringing higher-than-average rainfall and with it, nutrients, such that if a significant drought were to set in, conditions could change — though drought conditions in northwest Ohio remain more moderate than much of the rest of the U.S.

The kind of extremes that the climate crisis brings makes the NOAA’s job a tough one, Paerl said, and means the bloom prediction could swiftly go awry. “If the water suddenly slows down, well then those nutrients are going to be sitting in the lake, you know, ready to support a bloom.”

Through Water, Through Air

“Ohio has a very chronic problem,” Jiyoung Lee, an environmental health sciences professor at Ohio State University, told Truthout, as does much of the rest of the world.

Lee has been studying cancer data in the U.S. and in South Korea for the past 10 years. Together with a wide-ranging team of collaborators, Lee has found that microcystin strongly correlates with increased rates of liver cancer. In a 2020 article, the team compared cancer data from Ohio residents diagnosed with a malignant tumor between 2000 and 2014. They linked those cases to respective census tracts, allowing the team to connect a given person to their drinking water source.

Using satellite sensing to generate a list of surface water sources with visible cyanobacteria blooms from 2002 to 2011, Lee’s research team found that people whose water came from lakes and rivers impacted by algal blooms had a 17 percent higher incidence of liver cancer in comparison with those estimated to receive groundwater — a source coming from cooler and darker underground sources where algal blooms are not prevalent. Census tracts estimated to be served by bloom-impacted waters were also linked with higher levels of poverty and more likely to be coded as non-white.

Lee says exposure is commonly understood as occurring by sipping contaminated water, eating fish living in impacted ecosystems, or coming in physical contact through recreational activities like swimming or angling.

But exposure happens in more subtle ways too. Now, Lee is studying how the use of bloom-impacted water to irrigate crops like carrots and lettuce might also be contributing to the incidence of liver disease. The research is particularly pertinent given that 70 percent of freshwater withdrawals around the world go to irrigating agricultural fields, according to the United States Geological Survey. “We need to look at [exposure] in a more holistic way,” Lee said, noting potential links between other cyanotoxins and neurological conditions like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s.

A 2020 review by Paerl found that people might face exposure to toxins in even more passive ways, by inhaling aerosol particles from bloom-impacted sources that drift off of water flowing through household faucets.

“Zero Maggots”

While there is no one-size-fits-all fix for harmful algal blooms, Paerl said; there are plenty of what he calls “non-rocket science solutions,” like leaving native vegetation to serve as a buffer between development and waterways rather than carpeting the ground with grass, and ensuring that that septic systems are not leaking into water systems.

Most essential, Paerl said, is reducing the inputs that lead to algal blooms. “The knob we can tweak is the nutrient knob.”

Kristy Meyer is associate director of Freshwater Futures, a nonprofit focused on building political power to promote water democracy and empower residents to protect the Great Lakes. She says the Biden administration should expand which waters qualify as “Waters of the United States” — those that are protected under the Clean Water Act. In 2020, the Trump administration stripped federal protections for wetlands and streams. “I think of Lake Erie like a heart,” Meyer said. “If you cut off part of the capillaries, or the arteries, the heart starts to die. That’s basically what we’re doing when we roll back the Waters of the U.S.”

A new, more expansive rule, would allow regulators to set a daily limit on nutrients for smaller water bodies like wetlands and streams, requiring industrial-scale operations like factory or monocrop operations to figure out how to decrease what they’re releasing to a certain level or face consequences. Meyer also suggests that the next iteration of the farm bill, set to expire in 2023, should include provisions requiring agricultural operations receiving federal subsidies to be subject to a nutrient monitoring plan. Existing federal law sidesteps the nutrient runoff problem, as the Associated Press reported in 2017.

Increased protections are also needed from a public health standpoint, Toledo residents say. According to the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, drinking water is safe for adults so long as it contains less than 1.6 microgram per liter of microcystin. The World Health Organization’s limit is 1 microgram per liter. No health guidelines yet exist in the U.S. spelling out safe levels of microcystin in food, a guideline that researchers like Lee would like to see established.

Smith says health standards that allow for any level of a toxic substance to enter human bodies are not good enough from a justice point of view, given the legacy of health disparities that map onto race and class in the U.S.

“We always have these wonderful numbers: Five [micrograms per deciliter] of lead is allowed. That’s better than, you know, 15…. But zero is the amount of lead that is safe for consumption,” Smith says.

In the same sense, Smith contends that no level of microcystin is safe for consumption, and that local, state and federal governments should work toward fully eliminating it, and other toxins, from water and food systems.

“Zero maggots is what I want to eat,” Smith said.",0

The greatest generation believed that the environment was so vast, that any amount of pollution would be a drop in the ocean, so to speak.  Living standards advanced rapidly so no one really cared.  It turns out things are really cheap if you can just exhaust your pollution to a limitless environment.

Boomers inherited superfund sites, a disappearing ozone layer, air pollution so bad you couldn't see the sun, ever, in Los Angeles, and rivers and lakes so polluted that the rivers into lake Erie routinely caught on fire.  Yes, the river.

In order to pay the immense costs of a cleanup, politicians turned to pensions.  The country deferred paying its civil servants so that boomers could receive the benefits the civil servants provided, while the generations after the boomers paid all of the costs for the benefits the boomers got.  To get the civil servants to agree to defer their income, we promised them guaranteed returns on the money they deferred that would be far in excess of anything they could ever earn themselves.  Then, instead of putting that money away year by year, we just ignored it, and left all those costs for the next generation.  

The insanity was not extended to the post office, once it became clear that the post office would be forever shrinking.  Unlike what the media tries to tell you, when someone is hired for the post office, no one puts away 70 years worth of pension payments, but they do put away one year, every year, so that when the post office is half its size, the pensions will be there.  So someone who earns $45,000 and  is expected to work for 50 years has 1/50th of their total estimated pension payout set aside each year by setting postal rates to the appropriate amount to cover it.  That means the people who mail letters today will pay for the pension of the letter carrier who carries that letter today. You won't be stuck with that cost.

The boomers will pay for those pensions.  All other pensions are unfunded, and generations after the boomers will pay for those pensions for services the boomers got, but you will now pay for.  Thats how all this mess was cleaned up without impacting current living standards.  It will of course impact your living standards.  Thanks boomers!",0

t1_gnkezcj,Futurology,2021-02,2021-02-15 19:52:28,1,B,"Here are some actual real ways that the meat industry is damaging people.

Methane release: methane is 30 times more effective at heat capture vs C02; agribusiness, in particular livestock and feed production, is one of the largest global contributors of methane on the earth's atmosphere. Reducing meat consumption would be a major step in reducing the very real impact of global warming.

Algae blooms: Livestock waste run off (along with other agribusiness run off) is a direct contributor to the formation of algae blooms in fresh water systems. The lake Erie blooms are the cause of major fish and ecological die offs and makes it unsafe to swim or boat in.

Health impacts: Meat and dairy should be eaten in moderation assuming average amounts of physical activity; their caloric values are very dense. Along with this, processed meats are major sources of carcinogens. Thanks to regulatory capture, meat prices are subsidized to drive consumption. This, along with food pyramids that over promote meat consumption (again, regulatory capture, the development of the new food pyramid in Canada was highly politicized), is a contributing factor to obesity in the west.",0
t1_gnldl0h,interestingasfuck,2021-02,2021-02-16 00:39:54,1,A,"I actually watched something like this form once in Western New York on Lake Erie. The mouth of an outlet creek happened to be the “weak point” one spring while all of the 10-12’ thick ice started melting and breaking up on the lake. There must have been some pretty crazy winds in Canada that day (it was perfectly calm where I was) but it pushed all the ice towards the shore very hard, and it smashed its way up the creek outlet. All the way up to under a relatively low bridge that crossed the creek. It widened what was a 30’ wide creek to about 120’ and had pieces of ice over 80’ wide and probably stacked up about 20-30’ and it even wedged itself under the bridge and slightly lifted it off the ground. 

And by widening the creek... I mean absolutely leveling all trees (regardless of size) and ripping out all grass and everything without any effort.

Septic runoff, construction of the new road within the riparian area (thus less attenuation of sediment,) a farm within in the watershed (haven't done much in the watershed since 2016 but last I knew, the farmer was resistant to changing and practices,) manure from horses/goats, dispersed campsites without toilets, and possibly a newly established population of waterfowl frequenting the lake.

Geologic time is amazing. The salt beds extend east to New York state and are mined throughout the region. Salt mining is also happening  in SE Ontario as well.

i) Eliminate potential sewage overflows to Lake Erie at Seacliff Beach.

ii) Eliminate unnecessary treatment of storm water at the pollution control centre.

iii) Make available the Seacliff trunk to operate as a separated sanitary sewer.

So my question to the City would be why is this group of homeowners being charged for benefits that may benefit the entire system of WWW users?

For i), by this I presume they are implying it is the sanitary sewer (not storm)? If so, why are you (and your neighbours) paying the cost that will benefit all residents that use that beach and value clean water? Is there a capacity study or something that shows explicit benefit to your neighbourhood?

For ii), not relevant to your bill as that is storm sewers (you are only paying for sanitary sewer). Unless they are talking about sanitary sewer inflow and infiltration (I&amp;I) problems here which is an entirely different can of worms! In that case, this is also a benefit to you.

For iii), what benefit does this provide to you as homeowners?

It's a done deal at this point frankly, but I would want to know how Exactly my property has been improved in writing. Substantially less probability of a sewer backup perhaps (which is well worth $6000 if that was an existing issue)?

The development of these apartments will also increase the intensity of runoff directly into the water there which could negatively impact bank stability and so the reinforcement of the banks and removal of trees may be part of an effort to mitigate future bank erosion.

[From the concept plans for the apartment development](https://www.cityofsylvania.com/businesses/economic-development/current-development-projects/the-somo-project/) there is proposed work shown directly along the north bank of Tenmile Creek and the West Bank of North Tenmile Creek. There seems to be an emphasis in this development of creating spaces with views of the water (whether from apartments or the open spaces), and while that sounds nice, it may be unfortunate as the trees and vegetation that line streams (also called riparian vegetation) are very important for the health and quality of the streams and the waters downstream (e.g. Lake Erie). Clear cutting trees along the banks and replacing them with an occasional tree and the rest as turf grass (which will possibly be fertilized by a landscaper and result in additional nutrient pollution) is a step down for water quality, and as OP mentioned definitely a step down from the original forested feel of the area felt under the existing tree canopy. That being said if we are talking about trees being removed on the south bank of Tenmile Creek, even if that were done in support of bank stabilization for this development, there would be no reason not to replant [native] vegetation in that park area (though obviously it takes a while for plants to grow and the canopy to recover).

Most famous is the victory of [Oliver Hazard Perry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Hazard_Perry) during the war of 1812. In recent years the lake, once known for abundant fishing and recreational activities, has been in recovery from excessive pollution and invasive species.



The design invokes this history, with the deep blue of the lake waters bordered by [hazard bars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barricade_tape#United_Kingdom) in the colors of Canada and America (red and white).",0

Follow up studies found that farmworkers who were continuously exposed to low doses of pesticides over only a few years had increased risks of brain and reproductive health problems and cancer. This almost exclusively effects Latino workers, and my mother has suffered this effects from spending her teen years picking fruit.

There's also the basically unregulated use of dumping of chemicals and fertilizers into watersheds that threaten the safety of drinking water in the Great Lakes - which provides most of the world's supply of fresh water. Several years ago, there was a water crisis involving Lake Erie where the water was unsafe to drink due to unfilterable toxins released by algal blooms. The longer, warmer summers plus fertilizer run off creates the perfect environment for poisionous algae.

By 5th grade we had moved to Michigan. The sand dunes, the lakes, the holiday's at a family's cabin were all things I loved. I hate being so far away from clean water. The water here is so bad. If I can put my hand under the water and it vanishes its a no go and sadly most of the water is like that. I miss seeing little fish swim and nibble on my toes, I miss the clear water of Lake Michigan (lake Erie was pretty dirty where I lived so we didnt swim in that lake). 

I also suffer from barometric weather changes pretty bad. Sometimes 3 days before it rains or snows i'll be laid up in bed because I get to dizzy I often hurt myself by just walking, I've passed out and fallen off the stairs (my bottom 4 are open), I've fallen off the sidewalk and twisted my foot, didnt pick my foot up high enough and tripped and fell into a wood beam outside my bathroom. And the weather changes constantly here, im just always in a state of depression and anxiety because of it, im not living life, im just living. 

I went to my cousins in Arkansas and it was beautiful, I went to a waterfall, went and collected crystals, floated in a lake with a mountain in the background, went and sat in a hot spring. I was just so at peace there, but I wouldn't want to live there. But I want to go to Maine, its been on my list for years and my friends and I all had plans to go in July but with covid no one had extra money cause they were all put on part time hours on rotations and some picked up extra jobs. We looked at moving there back in 2011 and my friends who live in that area love it. 

It sucks cause I feel trapped here. Im in a house I hate and have always hated. My parents when we tried to sell hounded me with texts daily about moving and we were only planning on moving 30 minutes away to be closer to work and when we couldn't sell told me how happy they were no one wanted my house. My husbands family is here all of them, so he wont leave. He just started up a new business venture, which I did approve but now kinda wish I hadn't cause at some point im gonna have to pull the plug and demand we move to the coast with more steady weather.

Back to the agricultural industry and pesticides. I do hope that they get banned or maybe regulate a FAR better alternative. Another huge thing is the agricultural industry needs to be regulated or incentivized to contain their own run-off on site. Maybe creating their own wetlands that farm tile drains to would be ideal. Literally every other industry either connects to a sanitary sewer or septic tank.

This is why SW Ontario and its great lakes are such shit-holes now. Especially Lake Erie. Every time there's a beach ban due to e-coli warnings, it's due to Agriculture.

Of the big lake they called Gitche Gumee
The lake, it is said, never gives up her dead
When the skies of November turn gloomy
With a load of iron ore twenty-six thousand tons more
Than the Edmund Fitzgerald weighed empty
That good ship and true was a bone to be chewed
When the gales of November came early
The ship was the pride of the American side
Coming back from some mill in Wisconsin
As the big freighters go, it was bigger than most
With a crew and good captain well seasoned
Concluding some terms with a couple of steel firms
When they left fully loaded for Cleveland
And later that night when the ship's bell rang
Could it be the north wind they'd been feelin'?
The wind in the wires made a tattle-tale sound
And a wave broke over the railing
And every man knew, as the captain did too
T'was the witch of November come stealin'
The dawn came late and the breakfast had to wait
When the gales of November came slashin'
When afternoon came it was freezin' rain
In the face of a hurricane west wind
When suppertime came, the old cook came on deck sayin'
""Fellas, it's too rough to feed ya""
At seven PM, a main hatchway caved in, he said

The beach at CP isn't really known to have bacterial issues like some beaches (due to waterfowl poo and the like). It is a big body of natural water with animals in it, so it isn't going to be like pool water, but unless you have serious health issues, I wouldn't be wary of swimming in it, just don't go drinking it (the same could be said for clear mountain streams).

Lake Erie is a clay bottomed lake, so there is a fair amount of sediment floating around, so it can look ""dirty"" or polluted up close. It is just sedimentary particles, nothing to be worried about.

Cedar Point's beach is pretty nice, and it is a nice beach to swim at, as the water deepens at a nice gradual pace, so it is easy to find a nice spot that is just right. The sand is normally clean, and it is decently long, so there is plenty of room and you're not crowded all together.

I never experienced any severe undertow or riptides at CP's beach, but I would assume if there was a risk of some they would change the status to yellow or red.",0

I imagine the western end of Lake Superior will eventually bloom green like western Lake Erie. Duluth will be the new Cleveland.

Adding:. Duluth has had a few ""once in a lifetime"" storms recently, 2012 in particular but also 2019:

""Back at the Lakefront, crashing waves punished the shoreline where Duluth’s Lakewalk used to be a favorite of visitors.

“It used to be right here,” said Randy Brody. “It’s been destroyed by previous storms and it hasn’t been rebuilt yet.”

At an evening press conference, Duluth Mayor Emily Larson raised the issue of climate change in relation to the storms.

“Yes, that’s a different press conference,” Larson said, “but we are definitely seeing them more often and with greater severity.”

t1_gvxe4vr,Buffalo,2021-04,2021-04-26 13:29:17,1,B,"It's not just toxic algae blooms - I mean that's a legitimate concern, but lakes and rivers in this area are more vulnerable to eutrophication than anything - maybe not something as large as Lake Erie, but the rivers and other small bodies of water are vulnerable. 

It's somewhat straightforward:

- Phosphorous and to a lesser extent, nitrogen ends up running off of fields. Luckily, nitrogen-based fertilizers aren't as effective at causing phytoplankton growth, and phosphorus-based fertilizers, while they're very, very good at causing growth, they're ""sticky"" so they have a harder time getting to bodies of water from where they're applied. 
 - UNfortunately, so much of both is being used that they make their way there anyway. 
- Phytoplankton (including algae) eat up the fertilizer
 - Some of the blooms are toxic, others just cause more water turbidity
- Zooplankton eat the algae, reproduce, eat more
- Fish eat the zooplankton, reproduce, at as much as they can
- Algae is depleted, and a massive population of zooplankton starve. Zooplankton is depleted, and all the fish begin to starve
- You are left with, eventually, if left unmitigated, a beautiful sparkling blue lake that's completely dead. 

Some of the smaller finger lakes went through bouts of eutrophication like this. This is going back a number of years, but I think I recall Skaneateles lake going through this. All the nearby farmland runoff eventually killed the lake as described (lots of pig farms with very, very, very phosphorous-rich byproducts (poop). 

***

The bulk of the effects are not going to be tied to residential use of retail fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides. That runoff is minimal and often gets broken down or processed before it can make it to a larger body of water, and when it gets there, the amounts are too small to be troubling. The major concern is large farm use of these things, as the quantities are very high (glyphosate application essentially ends up with an entire field saturated in RoundUp as if a heavy rain just pummeled the area). 

***

Overall, we need to work hard to:

- Manage farm fertilizer and poop runoff
- Understand and manage the runoff coming from heavy glyphosate use
- Continue to manage and protect the Lake Erie and surrounding lakes/rivers' watersheds
- Worry less about what John Smith is buying at Walmart for his lawn, and worry more about what farmer john, golf courses, and large ""mow the grass"" parks are doing to manage their vegetation.",0

Toxic blooms in the lake made the water stink and the health department was always on edge as to whether to ban swimming or not. It was always stupid, one week it was ok, next week it wasn't. The advisories were always just a few points away from stopping people. I'd go swimming but only for very short periods and a very good shower immediately after. 

And on my walks along the beach? There were dead fish that regularly washed up and on the first week of July was the worst with hundreds of dead fish every mile and it literally stank up the shoreline for miles.

I've never seen Mr. Trash Wheel before, but it appears to be just a device that removes the trash once it is captured in the net. Full capture is an end-of-pipe solution, but there are also ways to prevent trash from entering storm drains in the first place. [Here's the EPA page on various trash capture technologies.](https://www.epa.gov/trash-free-waters/trash-capture-technologies)The easiest solution would be to make sure no trash ends up on the street in the first place, but public behavior isn't that easy to sway. It takes decades, and can be reversed. 

As far as how much trash makes it out to the deep ocean, or to the garbage patch, I have no idea. It comes from countries all over the Pacific Rim, but most comes from China, Indonesia, Vietnam, and some other East- and Southeast Asian countries.

\--

I love my job because I feel like I'm helping to make the world a better place, and I work with a bunch of people who share the sentiment. We could also go work in private industry and make more money, but we're passionate about what we do. I just wanted to shed some light on the situation because it can feel like no one cares and no one is doing anything. Before I started working at the Water Board, none of this was apparent.  When I was reading our TMDL for trash and debris in Santa Monica Bay, I realized why the city of Manhattan Beach had banned smoking outdoors and polystyrene; if municipalities outlaw certain disposable items that often end up in storm drains, they get a few extra years to come into compliance with all the other requirements.

Having the resources and time to crunch the data is only the beginning, and the shortest step in the process. Dischargers need to change their processes and that can take years. Sometimes infrastructure needs to be retired, altered, or built. The final compliance deadline for California power plants to stop using once-through cooling water, for example, is 20 years for one facility. Another facility knew it would not be able to meet the requirements and chose to cease operations. That may be fine for one low-output power plant, but cities will flood if the storm drains were not operational. Parts of the San Fernando flood anyway even with functional drains. 

Have you ever been at working waiting on someone to give you something so you could do their job, but they're waiting on someone, and that person is waiting on someone, and so on? It's kind of like that. There are so many moving pieces not even counting red tape, that changes take years and years. I know its frustrating when it seems like we don't have time. New solutions are being developed all the time, like the city of Santa Monica's Urban Runoff Recycling Facility, which recovers dry weather urban runoff and removes pollutants so the water can be used for non-potable purposes.",0

Some of those microbes that grow cause infections, and just a few years ago in Toledo Ohio (where lake Erie gets more shallow and therefore warmer) they had some deaths because of an toxic algae bloom the drinking water plant wasn't built to handle.

But it's funny, stateside, there's a growing push for recycled water (ie: toilet to tap).  I doubt Canada will ever have a need, but California sure does.  It gets pushback for the optics, but I always kind of laugh.  Like, sure you picture a nice mountain stream or whatever but what do you think is in natural water ways?

Lest there be any confusion, agricultural runoff is western Lake Erie’s biggest source of algae-forming nutrients.

A third Ohio Environmental Protection Agency study since 2016 has confirmed that through science, firming up past conclusions.  

The agency has been doing that through so-called “nutrient mass balance” studies which look at data that tracks algae-forming phosphorus across the state.

In 2015, the Ohio General Assembly passed a law requiring them to be done once every two years.

That decision came in response to Toledo’s 2014 algae-driven water crisis, when the city’s tap water was deemed unsafe to drink or touch over the first weekend of August that year because an algal poison from the lake had breached the city’s treatment system.

For those studies, the Ohio EPA uses the best available data to determine the percentages of algae-growing phosphorus and nitrogen coming from non-point sources - primarily farm runoff - or point sources, typically sewage treatment plants and their system overflows.

Northwest Ohio’s Maumee and Sandusky rivers were among 11 watersheds examined across the state.

The most recent report, issued on Christmas Eve, didn’t deviate much from the 2018 study - not that anyone expected a large shift within such a relatively short amount of time.

The latest report shows 89 percent of the Maumee River’s phosphorus comes from non-point sources such as agricultural runoff, compared to 88 percent in 2018.

It also shows non-point sources - again, primarily agriculture - account for 92 percent of the Sandusky River’s phosphorus now, compared to 93 percent in 2018.

Percentages vary from stream to stream, but - for much of the state - consistently show agriculture as a primary driver. One exception is the Cuyahoga River watershed near Cleveland, because it is much more urbanized than streams in northwest Ohio and elsewhere.

“Significant changes generally are not expected over a short time period,” Heidi Griesmer, Ohio EPA spokesman, said. “However, in addition to being required by law every two years, the nutrient studies help us track trends over short periods. Over longer periods, the data compiled will identify whether significant changes are occurring. The next report is due in 2022 and will include nine years of data for comparison.”

Ty Higgins, Ohio Farm Bureau Federation spokesman, said there “is simply not enough data to show any definitive trends” yet.

“But he agreed the findings, along with other current water quality research, are “key components to finding science-based solutions for clean water and more data will certainly be helpful as future studies are released.”

Phosphorus is the nutrient most closely associated with algal bloom sizes, while nitrogen often influences toxicity.

One reason for the heavy input from agriculture: Seventy-nine percent of the Maumee River watershed’s land is in agricultural production.

In the Sandusky River watershed, 80 percent of the land is in agricultural production.

Runoff figures in spring and early summer — when most of the fertilizers are applied — often are dictated by not only volumes of rainfall between March 1 and July 31, but also the severity, timing, and duration of thunderstorms, experts have said.

Ms. Griesmer said the latest study “confirms information from previous [nutrient mass balance] work about phosphorus loading.”

“This information confirms that H2Ohio is on the right path in focusing on the agricultural sources of phosphorus running into the western basin of Lake Erie,” she said.

Shelby Croft, Ohio Department of Agriculture spokesman, said that agency has been focused on water quality issues for years. It, too, has confidence in the DeWine administration’s H2Ohio program, although she did not rule out the possibility of adjustments as more science comes in.

“ODA has learned many things about delivering the H2Ohio program in the past 11 months, and undoubtedly what we’ve learned will lead to tweaks in program structure and delivery methods in the future,” she said.

Ms. Croft said the state agriculture department remains committed to programs based around voluntary incentives.

“Moving forward, additional research and monitoring data will likely cause adjustments to [best management practices] offered through the program, or may bring new practices into the program,” she said.

Environmentalists said they saw shortcomings in the latest report.

Pam Taylor of Environmentally Concerned Citizens of South Central Michigan said it’s “no surprise that the watersheds in northwest Ohio continue to be highest nonpoint sources of phosphorus.”

“We continue to test the water in Michigan’s portion of both the Maumee and Raisin watersheds, as we’ve done for 20 years, and have seen no improvement,” she said. “Until the application of liquid manure over subsurface drain tiles is restricted in the western Lake Erie region, and until the states involved and the U.S. EPA demand accountability in the form of water tests instead of soil tests or evidence of best practices, nothing will change and the millions of dollars spent on remediation for harmful algae and bacterial pollution problems here will continue to be wasted.”

Mike Ferner, Advocates for a Clean Lake Erie founder, described the report as “two more years of [the Ohio EPA] kicking the can down the road, telling us what we already know: the lion’s share of what’s poisoning Lake Erie comes from agriculture.”

Sandy Bihn, Lake Erie Waterkeeper founder, said this and previous reports “are remiss in reporting the massive increases” in manure generated by livestock facilities close to or large enough to be known as concentrated animal feeding operations, or CAFOs.

“Failing to disclose major manure increases in the Maumee and failing to divide agriculture into commercial fertilizer and manure means that Ohio wants to tout the H2O rhetoric to make it look like Ohio cares about Lake Erie, but in reality Ohio is doing little to nothing to reduce manure sources,” she said.

Fishing is dangerous, too, with nearly all saltwater fish being precariously overfished already, and freshwater fish are often understudied, underregulated, and threatened as well (see Asian carp, lampreys, and look into ‘tire dust,’ and further, consider that the climate is changing- here by the Great Lakes, for example, Lake Erie has had some 1.5% ice cover so far, while the average by this time is at 15%. This means a LOT to the animals living in the lake as it greatly affects clarity of environment aka feeding for fish). Local farmers are, yes, generally more eco-friendly than factory farms, but since about 99% of all animal products come from factory farms (99.9% of eggs), it’s pretty likely neither you nor any of your friends are shopping local family farms (Source; sentience institute via USDA &amp; epa). Additionally, in a horribly sad irony, local/humane farming is STILL not sustainable, and perhaps less so than factory farms. There is simply not enough land to raise all those billions of animals humanely- animal agriculture already takes up 50% of usable land, and 80% of food crops go to feeding animal agriculture. 

So, while perhaps there is variance to how destructive an animal-based diet is, it remains that eating plant based is the ONLY ethical option.

Plant based is hardly extreme. What’s extreme is having the option to eat a less environmentally destructive diet during the sixth great extinction, and not.",0

That good ship and true was a bone to be chewed
When the gales of November came early
The ship was the pride of the American side
Coming back from some mill in Wisconsin
As the big freighters go, it was bigger than most
With a crew and good captain well seasoned
Concluding some terms with a couple of steel firms
When they left fully loaded for Cleveland

They may have broke deep and took water

The Cuyahoga River ( KY-ə-HOG-ə, or KY-ə-HOH-gə ) is a river in the United States, located in Northeast Ohio, that bisects the city of Cleveland and feeds into Lake Erie. As Cleveland emerged as a major center for manufacturing, the river became heavily affected by industrial pollution, so much so that it ""caught fire"" at least 13 times, most famously on June 22, 1969, helping to spur the American environmental movement. Since then, the river has been extensively cleaned up through the efforts of Cleveland's city government and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA). In 2019, the American Rivers conservation association named the Cuyahoga ""River of the Year"" in honor of ""50 years of environmental resurgence.""

I've been fishing Lake Erie my entire life and have witnessed the algae blooms. So when I see posts like this it's a reminder of how far we've come and how far we still have to go. The best way IMO to support change is to buy a fishing license from any the Great Lakes states. State DNR's do the most for research, awareness, and prevention.

Yes they have, when that environment is privately owned. Because the owners of the property will try to protect it, the aggressors on the property would have to stop the invasion and pay for the damage they caused.

The main characteristic of the market is not the collection of profits without any consequences and rules, in fact it is a characteristic of the state in collecting taxes. The state can collect taxes by force, but a private company cannot make a profit by violating other people's property rights. The main characteristic of the market is the system of property rights.

Go back to what I said

&gt; The market cannot solve problems where the market is not allowed to exist.

&gt; The market cannot solve the problem of air, river and ocean pollution, as long as these resources are state-owned. For example. Pollution problems would have been easily solved if the courts had defended private property.

Anyone has been able to dump polluting garbage and wastes in the waters, for example. But consider what would happen if private firms were able to own the rivers and the lakes. If a private firm owned Lake Erie, for example, then anyone dumping garbage in the lake would be promptly sued in the courts for their aggression against private property and would be forced by the courts to pay damages and to cease and desist from any further aggression.

In fact, it is government officials who have no reason to care about the environment, which has proven to be true through practice, letting state-owned resources be polluted.

&gt; or stopping a meteor from hitting our planet

Private companies solve an unimaginable number of problems, why not this one as well. Private companies are even responsible for weakening the pandemic by producing vaccines. You must have thought why private companies would produce a vaccine ...

&gt; or keeping people at home during a pandemic

I have already explained that the market implies a system of property rights above all, these property rights enable anyone who wants to isolate himself and not let anyone on his private property. In a fully privatized system, there would also be private cities, private streets and more, which would make rules for themselves in relation to the risk they feel. Locking citizens in their homes is a bad way to solve problems, and it also violates basic rights. It's like solving the problem of crime by banning people from going to parts of the city with increased crime...",0

So governments are bad, but courts are good?  Who enforces the decisions of the courts? Also, what is to stop the polluters from just buying the land they want to pollute?  And who do they buy it from?

&gt;Private companies solve an unimaginable number of problems, why not this one as wel

Because sad as it is, individuals aren't going to voluntarily pay a company to stop a meteor from hitting our planet. This is the type of issue that only public spending is equipped to solve.

I believe they hold close to a quarter of the entire planet’s freshwater.

If flow rates over the falls stay the same (which they do control, monitor and limit very closely now to ensure diversion to power generation/utility consumption is fair and not drying it up), part of the falls could disappear in 2,000years. Even if these falls have a never ending source of water, the other thing is that the falls’ location is eroding further upstream over time. Although man made intervention could slow this down, the forces of erosion are pretty constant and it will eventually run it all the way back to Lake Erie (in ~50,000years) to turn it into more of a series of rapids versus the massive falls that exist today.

By the way, and we both already know this, I'm clearly referring to before ""Pakistan"" ever existed and there was constantly conflict near Punjab between the Muslims and Hindus which is why the Sikhs had a very militaristic religion, and it's why Guru Nanak promoted the idea that there ""is no Muslim, no Hindus"" etc..

This is true for every free market in general, not just the stock market. I’ve seen major manufacturing companies here in my home state of Ohio dump their toxic waste into Lake Erie for years, causing toxic algae blooms in the summer months. It’s cheaper for them to illegally dump their toxic waste and then simply write a check to the EPA for their fine, rather than actually pay to have their toxic waste disposed of properly. These toxic algae blooms have devastated communities along the shores of Lake Erie for years.

When a large corporation is fined for illegal behavior, that fine needs to be a percentage of their revenue. Say, 5-10% of their bottom line. And if they do it again, the percentage increases to 10-15%. That’s the only way any fine will actually force a billion-dollar company to change their illegal behavior. 

A $275K fine to a billion-dollar hedge fund is nothing. They’re probably paying their wives’ boyfriends more than that every week",1

Even if the bars somehow enforce distancing rules, nobody will have the authority to control all the contact that will happen on busy streets, which will be teeming with tourists overflowing from reduced-capacity establishments.

Of the big lake they called Gitche Gumee
The lake, it is said, never gives up her dead
When the skies of November turn gloomy
With a load of iron ore twenty-six thousand tons more
Than the Edmund Fitzgerald weighed empty
That good ship and true was a bone to be chewed
When the gales of November came early

The ship was the pride of the American side
Coming back from some mill in Wisconsin
As the big freighters go, it was bigger than most
With a crew and good captain well seasoned
Concluding some terms with a couple of steel firms
When they left fully loaded for Cleveland
And later that night when the ship's bell rang
Could it be the north wind they'd been feelin'?

The wind in the wires made a tattle-tale sound
And a wave broke over the railing
And every man knew, as the captain did too,
T'was the witch of November come stealin'
The dawn came late and the breakfast had to wait
When the gales of November came slashin'
When afternoon came it was freezin' rain
In the face of a hurricane west wind

When suppertime came, the old cook came on deck sayin'
Fellas, it's too rough to feed ya
At seven p.m., a main hatchway caved in, he said
Fellas, it's been good to know ya
The captain wired in he had water comin' in
And the good ship and crew was in peril
And later that night when 'is lights went outta sight
Came the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald

Does any one know where the love of God goes
When the waves turn the minutes to hours?
The searchers all say they'd have made Whitefish Bay
If they'd put fifteen more miles behind 'er
They might have split up or they might have capsized
They may have broke deep and took water
And all that remains is the faces and the names
Of the wives and the sons and the daughters

Lake Huron rolls, Superior sings
In the rooms of her ice-water mansion
Old Michigan steams like a young man's dreams
The islands and bays are for sportsmen
And farther below Lake Ontario
Takes in what Lake Erie can send her
And the iron boats go as the mariners all know
With the gales of November remembered

In a musty old hall in Detroit they prayed,
In the maritime sailors' cathedral
The church bell chimed till it rang twenty-nine times
For each man on the Edmund Fitzgerald
The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down
Of the big lake they called Gitche Gumee

If you do want a backdrop of something in the region, I would try to capture Niagara Falls itself or one of the lift bridges along the canal, but if you want to include the milky way you'll have to be doing some kind of composite photo with relatively advanced techniques and skill to get something appropriate. And if you're doing that, there's no real reason to also capture the milky way you're going to composite in from such a light polluted area.

The green in Lake Erie and in Lake Huron’s Saginaw Bay is algae, which builds on the surface when winds are calm.

Sediment most often colors the Great Lakes in the spring and fall when transitioning weather patterns bring storms and strong winds. The winds stir the water, pulling quartz sand and silt from the lake bottom to the surface, says Richard Stumpf, an oceanographer with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.”

Ohio will never have mountains, and that’s fine. We have some pretty cool areas to hike but tbh I don’t think they get marketed or maintained well enough to be as big of a draw as they should be. I wish people would associate Ohio with awesome woodlands, meadows and wetlands with nice meandering streams. But that would take a lot of funding and work to eradicate honeysuckle and other invasive species from old growth forests, regrow and redrajn wetlands, building boardwalks, marketing &amp; publicizing, etc. to get this done.

Ohio could have some pretty sweet beaches too but our legislators are too interested bending over backwards to accommodate the farming lobby. Regulations need to be put on allowable runoff from farm fields to reduce the amount of toxic waste running into the water. This waste causes algae blooms in places like Lake Erie and Grand Lake St Mary’s, making the water completely toxic. The Zebra mussel and Asian Carp crises need to be handled too.
Make the lakes nice and we become a great alternative vacation spot to Michigan or places like Lake Cumberland.

Same goes for our cities. Over the past 10 years finally the right things are being done. But we can’t stop. The 3Cs need expansive mass transit to stay competitive. Not just one streetcar, but full light rail that stretches out into the inner ring suburbs to encourage transit-oriented development. Development barriers need to be created to rein in sprawl. More focus needs to be put on redeveloping blighted areas while allowing the people in those areas to be lifted up in the process. Other cities in other states have done it (Denver, Portland, Minneapolis to name a few). We can do it too in Ohio.

What’s great about Ohio is our location, our roads, our industry, and our diversity in both people and topography. If you want to do it, Ohio will probably have it somewhere.

So Ohio to me is like the grand Victorian with finishes from the 1980s... rough on the edges, in need of a lot of work, but 100% fixable. And we need to do it as a state despite the fact we are basically ran by morons who don’t know the difference between their head and their butt.",0

We've seen the homogenization of something we thought was local and unique.

People hop out of cars at scenic overlooks, snap a few selfies, and hop back in their cars.  No idea where they've been or what they saw.

Today at Avalanche i had a person holding two soda cans asking where the trash bin was.  It's at the trailhead, two miles away (next to your car).  We figured those two cans would end up behind a bush, next to all the used toilet paper.

Somebody was putting an inflatable SUP in the water, no tag.  All watercraft should be inspected for Aquatic Invasive Species (zebra mussels Quagga mussels, watermilfoi, etc.).  We don't want Avalanche Lake to end up like lake Erie.  We talked about that, and it's probably ok, please don't go over to the north shore because we have loons over there.  Guess where he went.

&gt;  
&gt;*Their swipes at fake-meat products—Impossible Burgers, Beyond Meat, and all the rest—are pretty much the same.*  
&gt;  
&gt;Progressives in the food movement have long been among the harshest critics of the livestock industry, mostly due to its reliance on Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs), commonly referred to as “factory farms.” These facilities are highly productive, but too often at the expense of animal welfare, and they place human medicine at risk through an excessive use of antibiotics. This is also the same livestock industry that supplies the red meats and processed meats Americans consume to excess, increasing the rates of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and some cancers.  
&gt;  
&gt;On the environmental side, runoff from livestock farms in the United States pollutes rivers and streams, degrading large bodies of water like Lake Erie and the Chesapeake Bay. The livestock industry is also a significant emitter of climate-warming greenhouse gases, contributing nearly [15 percent](https://uk.reuters.com/article/global-livestock-emissions/feature-fighting-global-warming-one-cow-belch-at-a-time-idUKL8N1U953J) of such emissions around the world.  
&gt;  
&gt;If imitation meat products from plant materials could begin replacing some of the real meat in our diets, all of these problems might be diminished. The fashion industry has learned to substitute imitation fur for the real thing; the shoe industry has learned to use imitation leather; imitation ivory has helped save elephants; and some imitation egg and dairy products are already a commercial success. Plant-based milks (made from almonds, oats, soy or coconuts, for example) now account for [14 percent](https://www.gfi.org/marketresearch#:~:text=Plant%2Dbased%20milk%20now%20accounts,an%20opportunity%20worth%20%2412%20billion.) of retail milk sales in the United States. If plant-based burgers could replace this much real ground beef in the coming decade, the needle could begin to move on a number of valuable goals.  
&gt;  
&gt;Despite this important opportunity, most food movement leaders have rejected plant-based meat imitations. Burgers assembled from plant materials, with chemicals added, do not conform to their preference for traditional “whole foods” with minimum processing and no added ingredients. Mark Bittman, previously a food columnist at the *New York Times* and a prominent food movement spokesperson, [faults imitation meats](https://newrepublic.com/article/119788/bloody-veggie-burger-not-vegetarians-including-mark-bittman) on these grounds: “If you’re combining a bunch of powders and turning it into something that looks like meat, I’m not sure you’re doing anybody any good. I don’t think it moves people in the direction of real food—which is the ultimate goal.”

From that article:

&gt;Government officials cannot sell the rivers or sell stock in them. Hence, they have no economic incentive to preserve the purity and value of the rivers. Rivers are, then, in the economic sense, ""unowned""; therefore government officials have permitted their corruption and pollution. Anyone has been able to dump polluting garbage and wastes in the waters. But consider what would happen if private firms were able to own the rivers and the lakes. If a private firm owned Lake Erie, for example, then anyone dumping garbage in the lake would be promptly sued in the courts for their aggression against private property and would be forced by the courts to pay damages and to cease and desist from any further aggression. ",0

I don't mean to be like ""just google it,"" but it is easy to find this information online, and how are we supposed to know that this is the policy issue that you care most about? Climate change is important but so are things like education, healthcare, jobs, the economy, racial equality, LGBT rights... you can't expect people to give you a full write up on where she stands on every issue because (1) that would be very long and (2) you already know that she's a progressive Democrat, and that tells you where she stands on most issues in a very general sense.

That's not to say that all Dems are interchangeable, but you have to remember that this is Michigan, a swing state whose last Governor was a Republican who completely poisoned an entire city's water supply so badly that it has made national headlines for the last 4 years (Flint). A state with a huge interest in protecting its water supply, the Great Lakes, which is under constant threat from Republican lobbyists who want to pollute them. Electing Whitmer was a big win for conservationists everywhere.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's her platform on conservation (copy and pasted):

* **Addressing the extensive water infrastructure crisis that the Great Lakes region is facing** by tripling the federal investment into the Clean and Drinking Water State Revolving Loan Funds to address our region’s $179 billion backlog in drinking water, wastewater, and stormwater infrastructure so all of our residents have access to clean, safe, and affordable drinking water. 
* **Incrementally ramp up funding for Great Lakes Restoration Initiative** to $475 million per year to boost the region’s work of increasing coastal resiliency, cleaning up toxic contamination, reducing runoff pollution, stopping invasive species, and restoring wetlands and other habitats.  
* **Support, fully fund, and expedite the plan to build new prevention measures at Brandon Road Lock and Dam** and support strong ballast water rules for every Great Lakes vessel to help stop and control the introduction and spread of invasive species in the region. Aquatic invasive species can alter the basic functions of the Great Lakes and all waterways, disrupting fisheries, wildlife, and water supplies.  
* **Committing to assisting states in meeting their goals of reducing nutrient pollution in the Western Lake Erie basin by 40 percent by 2025** through federal funding, resources, and new technologies while continuing to monitor, report, and reduce nutrient pollution in the other Great Lakes and regional water bodies. Harmful algal outbreaks threaten our drinking water, economy, outdoor recreation, and fish and wildlife.  
* **Supporting federal funding for ports, harbors, and critical marine infrastructure including the Soo Locks reconstruction project at Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan.** In addition to $52 million provided by the State of Michigan, $900 million is needed to modernize the Soo Locks and ensure they remain operational through reconstruction. A six-month unplanned closure at the Soo Locks would devastate the production of integrated steel, automobiles, and other heavy equipment throughout North America, decreasing U.S. gross domestic product by $1.3 trillion, costing the U.S. more than 11 million jobs. 
* **Push for increased federal action of both the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Defense to address PFAS contamination.** Across the Great Lakes region, states are tackling the challenge of addressing toxic contaminants like PFAS chemicals. States are looking to the federal government for financial resources and leadership in establishing drinking water standards.

I hope to continue the work I've already done on Council I eluded to it in my video it comes down to Safety Reconstruction, Environmental Justice, &amp; Anti Corruption legislation.

Safety Reconstruction 
Past work:  Sensible Toledo; decriminalization of Cannibus in Toledo. 
Present: Provide resources to underfunded communities &amp; people 
Goal: End bad policy &amp; wasteful spending that doesn't result in increased safety.  Do more to tackle to root of of crime as opposed to treating the symptoms 

Environmental Justice
Past work:  Lake Erie Bill of Rights; established the right for Lake Erie to be able to naturally grow &amp; flourish as part of our eco system by giving it rights.
Currently: Work to eliminate the barriers that prevent homeowners &amp; renters from the risk of lead paint poisoning.
Goal: govern with the idea that Toledo's most valuable resource is our environment. Environmental harm will disproportionately impact Toledoans health safety &amp; wellbeing &amp; future. 

Anti Corruption
Past work: Move to Amend Citizens United; established locally that corporations are not people &amp; each year we have a public hearing on democracy day on the impact of corporate money in politics.
Currently: Move to more publicly funded elections that remove barriers to new candidates getting involved &amp; create a pay to play atmosphere of corruption in government.
Goal: To change the culture of those with the most money having a greater influence on elected officials.

Typhoid rates in Fort Erie, North Tonawanda and Niagara Falls was many times higher than Buffalo, thanks to pollution from the Buffalo River, and the City of Buffalo dumping untreated sewage into the Niagara River.

The canal, obviously, was never built.

,waterloo,2020-11,2020-11-12 19:03:36,1,D,"""Isn't it going right back into the aquifer though?"" Not really. If you draw water from a 50 m deep well (a lot of the Region's wells are this deep) and then dump it back into the ground at the surface in a totally different location, you've completely altered that water's fate - in all likelihood that water was hundred+ year old rainwater (within a regional aquifer that naturally slowly, slowly, slowly moves water to regional discharge features like major creeks and the Grand River - like over thousands of years) when it was pumped, and dumping it back into the ground at surface, now it's part of the shallow flow system most likely to discharge to a local drainage ditch or small creek, from there it'll go to the grand and then Lake Erie, gone from the watershed far faster than it would have otherwise.

"" And don't all cities have substantial (more than 10%) freshwater loss in the delivery network? "" Yes absolutely. I develop groundwater models for a living  (the Region's groundwater model being one of them) and I can tell you ""enhanced recharge"" is very often applied to models in urban areas to account for this. Water distribution network engineers come at this from the other angle and tell me just how much they think they're losing through leaky pipes and it helps me inform the groundwater model's boundary conditions.

Calling it a ""massive"" waste isn't really accurate considering the quantities involved (the region pulls 115 million litres out of the ground every friggin' day so you can have a clean car and a green lawn), but don't take it for granted - death by a thousand cuts is a real thing and we all need to engaged and informed about it to preserve our most vital public resource.

“Commercial farms’ use of fertilizer is responsible for a majority of the nutrients that feed Lake Erie’s toxic algae blooms. Fertilizer is rich in phosphorus, a key ingredient in plant growth, but when too much phosphorus enters a waterbody, nutrient loading occurs and can trigger an explosive growth in algae. When the algae dies, it absorbs oxygen in the water, creating dead zones and the eventual die-off of aquatic plants and animals.”",0

You can literally go out hundreds of feet from shore and still only be waist deep in bath water temps.

I remember several years ago the water quality in Lake Erie was improving, and a portion of that was apparently due to the quantity of Zebra Mussels, which we've always been taught were pests, but apparently they eat and filter out the algae and were doing wonders for our water quality. Also pollution regulation. I'm not sure what happened since then, but it's gotten bad again. Our lakes and rivers are catching on fire again for the first time in like 20 years. Its terrifying and heartbreaking. I mean, I'm no expert of course, but something that both improves water quality while also producing materials that can be sold? And its solar powered?

Unless you're saying that the 1° rise in global temperature, isn't enough to convert snow to water? I guess that is technically true in some cases. It might not directly impact it, but there's so many other factors to consider. The slight increase in temp changes when and how long Lake Erie freezes over. This drastically impacts local climates. The rise in temps also creates massive algae blooms, which leads to worsening storms. Higher temps have been linked to less snow fall, but increased precipitation, leading to flooding, soil erosion and nutrient loss. Global warming is so much more in-depth then most people realize. Some areas will notice the impacts significantly more than others. 

You can look all this stuff up, it isn't my opinion. I've personally noticed a massive decrease in snow over the past few years, as well as unorthodox changes in weather.

However, the Balloonfest balloons collided with a front of cool air and rain and dropped towards the ground, still inflated, clogging the land and waterways of Northeast Ohio. In the days following the event, balloons were reported washed ashore on the Canadian side of Lake Erie.

&gt; Two fishermen, Raymond Broderick and Bernard Sulzer, who had gone out on September 26, were reported missing by their families on the day of the event. Rescuers spotted their overturned 16-foot (4.9 m) boat anchored west of the Edgewater Park breakwall. A Coast Guard search and rescue helicopter crew had difficulties reaching the area because of the ""asteroid field"" of balloons. A search-and-rescue boat crew tried to spot the fishermen floating in the lake, but Guard officials said balloons in the water made it impossible to see whether anyone was in the lake. On September 29, the Coast Guard suspended its search. The fishermen's bodies subsequently washed ashore. The wife of one of the fishermen sued the United Way of Cleveland and the company that organized the balloon release for $3.2 million and later settled on undisclosed terms.

&gt; Balloons landing on a pasture in Medina County, Ohio, spooked Louise Nowakowski's Arabian horses, which allegedly suffered permanent injuries as a result. Nowakowski sued the United Way of Cleveland for $100,000 in damages and settled for undisclosed terms.

&gt; Burke Lakefront Airport had to shut down a runway for half an hour after balloons landed there. Traffic collisions were also reported ""as drivers swerved to avoid slow motion blizzards of multicolored orbs or took their eyes off the road to gawk at the overhead spectacle"". 

&gt; The 1988 copy of The Guinness Book of World Records recognizes the event as a world record ""largest ever mass balloon release"", with 1,429,643 balloons launched.

Of the big lake they called Gitche Gumee
The lake, it is said, never gives up her dead
When the skies of November turn gloomy
With a load of iron ore twenty-six thousand tons more
Than the Edmund Fitzgerald weighed empty
That good ship and true was a bone to be chewed
When the gales of November came early
The ship was the pride of the American side
Coming back from some mill in Wisconsin
As the big freighters go, it was bigger than most
With a crew and good captain well seasoned
Concluding some terms with a couple of steel firms
When they left fully loaded for Cleveland
And later that night when the ship's bell rang
Could it be the north wind they'd been feelin'?
The wind in the wires made a tattle-tale sound
And a wave broke over the railing
And every man knew, as the captain did too
T'was the witch of November come stealin'
The dawn came late and the breakfast had to wait
When the gales of November came slashin'
When afternoon came it was freezin' rain
In the face of a hurricane west wind
When suppertime came, the old cook came on deck sayin'
""Fellas, it's too rough to feed ya""
At seven PM, a main hatchway caved in, he said
""Fellas, it's been good to know ya""
The captain wired in he had water comin' in
And the good ship and crew was in peril
And later that night when his lights went outta sight
Came the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald
Does any one know where the love of God goes
When the waves turn the minutes to hours?
The searchers all say they'd have made Whitefish Bay
If they'd put fifteen more miles behind her
They might have split up or they might have capsized
They may have broke deep and took water
And all that remains is the faces and the names
Of the wives and the sons and the daughters
Lake Huron rolls, Superior sings
In the rooms of her ice-water mansion
Old Michigan steams like a young man's dreams
The islands and bays are for sportsmen
And farther below Lake Ontario
Takes in what Lake Erie can send her
And the iron boats go as the mariners all know
With the gales of November remembered
In a musty old hall in Detroit they prayed
In the maritime sailors' cathedral
The church bell chimed 'til it rang twenty-nine times
For each man on the Edmund Fitzgerald

Hopefully offshore wind projects on Lake Erie can change this.

Solar is complicated by how dramatically seasonal it is for Ohio. Average might be similar to other places that have developed renewables, but without a better grid to import electricity, solar only pays off for 8 months, and the missing ones are the high-demand winter months. Means you need redundancy which makes things much more expensive.

&gt; Nuclear: About 330,000 birds, by Sovacool’s calculations.

https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/2014/08/22/pecking-order-energys-toll-on-birds

From the paper abstract cited by U.S. News:

&gt; Based on operating performance in the United States and Europe, the paper then offers a preliminary calculation of the number of birds killed per kilowatt-hour kWh generated for wind electricity, fossil fuel, and nuclear power systems. The study estimates that wind farms and nuclear power stations are responsible each for between 0.3 and 0.4 fatalities per gigawatt-hour (GWh) of electricity while fossil fueled power stations are responsible for about 5.2 fatalities per GWh. Within the uncertainties of the data used, the estimate means that wind farms killed approximately 20,000 birds in the United States in 2009 but **nuclear plants killed about 330,000** and fossil fueled power plants more than 14 million. 

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0960148112000857

Edit: furthermore, I found a source offering the actual paper:

&gt; The threat to avian wildlife from nuclear power plants can also be divided into upstream and downstream fatalities.
&gt;Uranium milling and mining can poison and kill hundreds of birds per facility per year. Indeed, in early 2008 the Cotter Corpo- ration was fined $40,000 for the death of 40 geese and ducks at the Cañon City Uranium Mill in Colorado. The birds apparently ingested contaminated water at one of the settling ponds at the uranium mine [1]. &gt;These deaths can be very roughly quantified into 0.006 deaths per GWh. &gt;The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service [31] has also noted that abandoned open pit uranium mines in Wyoming can form pit lakes hazardous to wildlife. Uranium-bearing formations are usually associated with strata containing high concentrations of selenium. It is not uncommon for these pits to kill 300 birds per year. Because those mines operated at about one-tenth the efficiency of Canon City, they would correlate to about 0.45 deaths per GWh. &gt;Taking the mean from both uranium mines gets us 0.228 fatalities per GWh.
&gt;Like fossil fueled power stations and wind farms, avian fauna can also collide with nuclear power plants. Three thousand birds died in two successive nights in 1982 from collisions with smoke- stacks and cooling towers at Florida Power Corporation’s Crystal River Generating Facility [1]. Given that the power plant now hosts an 838 MW nuclear reactor, and presuming it operated with a capacity factor of 90% and that the 3000 deaths were the only ones throughout the year, the facility was responsible for 0.454 avian deaths per GWh. Ornithologists observed 274 fatal bird collisions with an elevated cooling tower at the Limerick nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania from 1979 to 1980 [32]. Since the Limerick plant has a 1200 MW reactor, and also assuming it oper- ated at a 90% capacity factor, it was responsible for 0.261 deaths per GWh. At the Susquehanna plant in eastern Pennsylvania, 1500 dead birds were collected between 1978 and 1986 for an average of 187 fatalities per year [33]. Assuming that the 2200 MW plant operated at 90% capacity factor, it was responsible for 0.01 deaths per GWh. &gt;Extensive surveys for dead birds were also conducted at the Davis-Bess nuclear plant near Lake Erie in Northern Ohio. Orni- thologists recorded a total of 1554 bird fatalities or an average of 196 per year from 1972 to 1979 [33]. Given that the power plant hosts an 873 MW reactor, and assuming it operated with a 90% capacity factor, and the plant was responsible for 0.0285 fatalities per GWh. Taking the mean for each of the four power plants results in 0.188 deaths per GWh.
&gt;The total avian deaths per GWh for nuclear power plants are therefore about 0.416.

However, if everyone stopped supporting meat/dairy industries there would be a notable impact in a different way. Nutrient pollution from agricultural run off is creating harmful algal blooms throughout freshwater systems in the US, for example. Lake Erie has enormous blooms each year. This creates anoxic zones which obliterate ecosystems. 

Also, in terms of individual emissions. Air conditioning and refrigeration can be pretty big contributors. It’s actually fascinating, I think. The reason dense urban areas are hotter is mainly because of the feedback from CO2 emissions from air conditioning.

Until I went swimming in Lake Erie... I was out a good distance and without warning (okay, I was 17 and flirting, there may have been signs) fish began surfacing. Dead fish. It felt like hundreds or thousands (maybe less, but that's what my teenage brain remembered). Maybe the lake turned over in a spot? Methane bubble?  Whatever. No clue

But oh my sweet baby Jesus, swimming through those dead fish to get back to shore? It felt like miles. The dead fish were so thick I couldn't not touch them. These fish were... football sized or so. Every time I kicked, I kicked a fish. Every time I took a stroke, I hit a fish. They slid all over my body. There was no path without a fish. 

It took ages to get to shore. I was in a program for high school kids to get to tour colleges. They paid for everything and we also got to do a bit of fun stuff occasionally, like a beach afternoon. So there was a large group of high school kids to be wrangled up EARLY.  Everyone had to load on the busses and we all had to ride back to the hotel together. Fishy, soggy, and scarred.

I miss swimming so much. I've gotten a bit better  and have conquered some of the fear. My husband and I went out in our canoe almost once a week all summer long and into the fall.

Basically the issue is a totally natural one.  The Otter Creek and other Creeks like Catfish Creek etc are naturally silty.  The wave action with the sands grittiness and the silt weight combine to create a very abrasive environment at the shoreline.  Currently the north shore of Lake Erie is the fastest changing shoreline in the world.   100 acre farms people used to own have all but vanished.   The road between Port Stanely and Port Bruce had to be moved because it was going to be washed away soon.
Due to the sheer size of the bluffs (nearly 100 feet in most areas), there is no feasible way to engineer anything to stop this.   
I imagine if this was somewhere like a highly populated community in NY or Massachusetts they would throw money at it but because it's in a sparsely populated area with farmland, noone has the money or interest in doing anything about it.

As Cleveland emerged as a major center for manufacturing, the river became heavily affected by industrial pollution, so much so that it ""caught fire"" at least 14 times, most famously on June 22, 1969, helping to spur the American environmental movement. Since then, the river has been extensively cleaned up through the efforts of Cleveland's city government and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA). In 2019, the American Rivers conservation association named the Cuyahoga ""River of the Year"" in honor of ""50 years of environmental resurgence.""

,conspiracytheories,2020-12,2020-12-11 18:11:08,1,D,"I was at the first Earth Day in SF, so I’ve been a Tree Hugger ever since. I still work in habitat restoration, a thankless job and rapidly evolving into a futile effort. All I’ve learned over the years about the climate change timeline is being challenged at lightning speed.  Shit’s going down by centuries and decades faster than I had ever imagined. I’m not actually afraid, I’m sickened and saddened at how obvious the events are occurring. I’m from New Orleans, but moved to Western New York in 1993. I moved into my home Xmas eve 1993 and it snowed 58 straight days. FIFTY EIGHT MOTHERFUCKING DAYS!!! The entire front of my house disappeared as the snow on the ground met the snow on the roof. Several months were spent in walking an ice cave since I had 3 large picture windows down that long hallway. I was living in an ice cave. Snow plow service was $800 for 2 weeks. My driveway is 300 feet and the piles of snow on either side were about 4 feet taller than me, built by a powerful snow thrower. Driving out required getting out...and searching for any approaching vehicles; occasionally visibility was a matter of feet, so adrenaline was the drug of that era.  It was normal to have snowfall at the end of October that required plowing. That’s not been the case in years.

That was the 90s. Today it’s 48F. There’s a mere scattering of snow and you have to look for it! I’ve not needed a snow plow yet. Maybe in February? I checked my weather calendar (I keep my own records) and the usual temp right now was 0F. Yep, ZERO. 20 below was more common than not for several months. I don’t believe the Lake Erie Ice Dams are an issue like they used to be. Freak shit still happens, some years ago a town north of here got 8 feet of snow overnight. REALLY! Though it was about 60 miles north of me, I had a sunny day. Yeah, shits really weird at this stage. I don’t envy anyone born in the last decade, but they’ll have nothing to compare it with and they’ll have their own normal. But, just look at the photos of glaciers melting, taken from space. It’s damned insane. 

Then, there’s the hurricanes. I moved north because of Hurricane Andrew. I lost friends in Florida and decided I no longer wanted to fight that war. Considering what happened with Katrina, I’m relieved I did.

Anyway, my best to you! Climate Change is NOT a conspiracy. Spend more time reading what actual climatologists and geologists say about it. Twitter has some fantastic scientists that post daily and love answering stupid questions! Ciao, babycakes!",0

&gt;while in a communist system they'd be shot. Tell me which one is more barbaric.

When the known negligent actions result in multiple deaths, dining the company a pittance and allowing it to continue destroying the environment is far more harmful.

The company was fined a whole $470 million and the decision-makers behind it were slapped on the wrist with a $2,000 fine each.

Continental glaciers stretched from Hudson bay down into Iowa, and north part of ohio. Still have the big hills of glacial moraine in Ridge Tp., near Wyandot Co. and Hancock.

Massive glaciers gouged out most of Lake Erie and the other Great Lakes. Near Perry's island there are glacial grooves upwards of 8 feet in depth, to give some idea.

Glacial grooves also on limestone bedrock near BG State University. I pointed those out to the geologists, but they never got back to me. Later, emailed a geologist there and he said they knew of them, but had no idea I was the field tripper who found them.

When millions of sq. miles of glacial ice sheets began to melt, the land connections between India and Sri Lanka were severed as the oceans rose.  This important fact was missed..

I personally have an easier time on the rivers because the comfortable areas are further limited by current- carp are cold blooded, if they dont move they dont have to eat. Food is scarce in the winter so they dont want to move. Eddys behind big rock croppings or jettys, the sunny side of bays, any slow water on the warmer side is great. Bait wise i prefer a harder method mix in the winter bc you can sit on it and fish will bang it around and let you know they are there. They bite wicked light sometimes in the cold and its good to get some feedback to know you are on the right track. Also, warm water discharges are killer. Theres less and less of them these days since the best ones were attached to coal power plants but there used to be a popular one on lake Erie in Ohio. I never made the trip years ago when i travelled a lot for carp, maybe its still there. I used to go to a wwd in Alexandria VA and one in middle PA that were both killer even in the coldest weather but both are gone for a few years now. If you can find groundwater springs those can be hot spots too. Take note of the last spots to freeze in your local waters.

The only time people did not was in Estes Park area, and it outweighed those that did.

These are the type of people that come into town 2/3 times per year for goods. So that tells me stores are out of normal supplies in the area. Although a trip to both large &amp; small grocery stores showed little signs of empty shelves, so this might be very location specific. People in both states are definitely on edge no matter who you talk to, with a bit of hopium still lingering in Colorado. The fires are still going on in the west, with ash raining, &amp; smoke filled skies everyday. People rarely talk about it, but joke when they do, almost as if to help with their ‘new’ reality.

Now i can't find a sampling station at the start of any of the creeks and streams that feed into the river but i did find a watershed analysis of the water in Shenandoah.  The maps in their document have several different kinds of stations that they (the researchers) sampled from.  Also if you search for water sample stations in Shenandoah, you'll get all kinds of links for different kinds of analysis done in the park ranging from discussing water pollution caused by live stock, to suitable pH levels for fish,  monitoring algae blooms, and so on and so forth.  

I don't think it's a pump station, mostly because the water pump stations for hikers are at camp sites and cabins. The park says ""no camping"" on the limberlost trail. Maybe a long time ago, there was a camp site, but it's such a well maintained and easy to hike trail for the park, that it doesn't seem as likely of an answer as the sample station idea.

Pollution was and is a serious problem in the Rust Belt (Detroit, Cleveland, Pittsburgh and the areas around them) where there used to be just a ton of industry (coal, steel and automotive industries especially, none of which are terribly clean). The Cuyahoga runs directly through Cleveland and pretty much right on the banks are the steel yards and assorted factories, so they all just used to dump straight into the river. This in turn caused a river that more oozed than flowed and had solid layers of oil and trash on top. That’s what caught fire.

It got cleaned up and it’s much better now. Its still not a nice river, but fluke oil tanker accidents aside it doesn’t catch fire anymore and you can be next to it without getting sick.

If I remember correctly the whole third floor of the Great Lakes Science Center (in Cleveland and right on the shore of Lake Erie) is actually about the Great Lakes, the water cycle and the pollution of the Cuyahoga and the effort to clean it up.

Unfortunately, those short term benefits of using synthetic fertilizers can make your problem worse over time as different soil dwelling organisms that really highly impact your tree’s development rely on organic nitrogen sources too.

The results of unfettered dumping of raw sewage and industrial effluent added the word ""eutrophication"" to Americans' vocabulary.    My Mom, who grew up in Buffalo, can remember the signs on the beaches advising people not to swim. Cleveland was an especially large contributor to this dead zone, infamously, the Cuyahoga River caught fire in 1969. So, in 1972, the Cleveland Regional Sewer Commission was created. Sewage treatment was greatly improved with spectacular results.

I go swimming on the lake regularly on the Canadian side, the shallowness means it gets much warmer than the other great lakes, which makes for great swimming. Also makes it much more susceptible to algae blooms and pollution.

Lake Erie is a nice toasty pool temperature by mid June typically, while Lake Ontario is still freezing cold. Lake Ontario's warmest temperatures are typically way below Lake Erie.

Because of this Lake Erie is the only great lake to regularly completely freeze over in the winter. The others are so deep that they keep heat longer, keeping the ice off of them.",0

They were granted six miles on either side of the Grand River from the source to Lake Erie. The official map was drawn with straight lines and didn’t include the actual “headwaters” so the Crown issued paperwork and “reclaimed” them in the the late 1800s. The issue came up in 1993 when they started to build a new housing development in First Nation land. They went to court in 1995 but the court refused to hear arguments. They have continually protested by singing, dancing, and constructing tipis/wigwams. 

This bigger issue is the pipeline. It’s one of the most massive above ground tubes on earth. The Wetʼsuwetʼen people have a right to the land from the river source to the lake. If the pipeline failed it would contaminate the river from its source. The oil would penetrate the water table, the land on either side of the river would be spoiled for miles all down the river and their land would be ruined. 

You couldn’t do as much damage as an oil spill if you were burning and salting the earth. Their ancestors fought for Canada and lost life and land in a war that wasn’t about them.

,liberalgunowners,2020-05,2020-05-03 00:52:22,1,E,"I am not surprised by this reaction one little bit. I saw this coming back in 1987, so if anyone is interested, here's my ""This is why I'll *never* visit our benighted neighbors to the north ever again"" rant.

My girlfriend and me spent a few weeks in the summer of '87 driving around and camping in northern Michigan. I'd brought with me what was probably the cheapest mouse gun available at the time, a Raven Arms .25 Auto and a couple boxes of ammo, just to plink with. At one point we decided it would be kinda cool to visit Canada too, so we got the map out and decided to cross over at Sault Ste. Marie and sight see through to the Canadian side of Niagara Falls, where we'd cross back into the U.S. and drive home along Lake Erie back to Ohio.

So we pull up to the border station and there's a sign says something like ""take this lane if you have anything to declare."" Now I didn't know if I needed to ""declare"" this little handgun, but I knew Canadians were kinda funny about guns, so I figured better safe than sorry. I pulled into the designated lane and smiled and told the nice man there I had a handgun packed away in the back and wasn't sure if I needed to mention it. I swear his pasty face paled just a little bit as he directed me to a specific parking area.

The minute I stopped multiple border agents swarmed the car, ordered the two of us out, and demanded to know where the gun was. ""Well"" I said, ""it's in that backpack in the back seat, unloaded. Seems like this is a big deal to you guys, huh? I mean, you understand *I* told *you* it was there, right? There's nothing nefarious going on here, we're just camping!""

So they safely located the dangerous weapon, and then proceeded to pull every last thing we owned out of the car and dump it on the oil-stained pavement to be pawed through. Every dirty sock, every pair of underwear. There were sniffer dogs. At one point a border agent pulled a crushed empty cigarette pack from the *very* bottom of a sleeping bag and demanded to know ""who this belongs to"" as he slowly pulled it apart with gloved hands, looking for drugs? Explosives? Jimmy Hoffa?? 

They then took us into separate rooms and had us strip so they could paw through the clothes we were wearing too. When we got back to the car and *all* our stuff unpacked and strewn out on the lot, our cooler dumped and our food on the pavement, they said we could put our things back now.

""So what about my gun?"" You can't just bring a gun into Canada sir. ""Ok, but I'm sure as hell not letting you keep it, what now"" Well sir...so there was an hour and a half of forms to be filled out and lots of bureaucratic sneers and indignation that I would dare enter this other Eden, this demi-paradise with a dirty dirty gun, and the upshot was, I had to come back to this border crossing to reclaim my horrible weapon or forfeit it, which was clearly what they expected to happen.

So we went to Niagara Falls (was pretty cool) and drove all the way back to claim my shitty little Raven out of general goddamn principal. This process was *of course* a multi hour, multi-form filled exercise in manufactured difficulty designed by hoplophobic bureaucrats to dissuade people like me from despoiling their frozen Hoser paradise of enforced passivity with my can-plincking-in-the-woods ways! And they were successful. As I walked back to my car with my cheap little gun to drive the long way home from Michigan, I scraped the toxic, benighted queen-worshipping Canadian soil from my feet and vowed never enter their country again, and I never have.

Oh Canada, you've got some good things, like your health care system, but your current enthusiasm for becoming disarmed peasants is *exactly* what I would have predicted all those years ago. Enjoy!",0

This means that at some point down the line, the storm and sanitary sewers are combined into one line leads to a water treatment plant. The treatment plants are designed to be able to handle a certain volume of sanitary sewer waste, but when it rains a lot, there is simply too much volume for the capacity of the treatment plant. Rather than hold the extra water in the sewers and let it back up into the streets and eventually into peoples homes, the sewers have an emergency overflow that dumps into your nearest water body. This is why sometimes the beaches close for unsafe bacteria levels after heavy rains. Lake Erie gets full of poop water. 

These days, new sewers are always kept separated. It is really expensive to separate the old sewers, though. The CSO tunnels are one solution to hold the extra volume until excess capacity is available at the plant.

,WTF,2020-05,2020-05-11 00:47:08,1,B,"This has been a problem all through out the Great Lakes. I am curious to hear more about your situation, I like to know what's going on farther up the Great Lakes before it gets down to Niagara Falls and Lake Erie. Lake Ontario's shoreline has been up about 5-10 feet higher this year (it's been even higher than that in the past few years, hovering around 20 feet higher). A shit ton of Land along the NY Ontario shoreline has been lost due to the higher water line. It's been wiping out docks/boat houses and creating massive flooding issues everywhere. Lake Erie's level has also been up higher, I know of erosion problems along the shore line of Buffalo and Western New York too.  


Where I live, the lower Niagara river is also up about 5-10 feet higher and some of the landmark rocks below Niagara Falls are no longer visible. I look at the river all day long while I am at work and I have never seen it as high as it has been the past couple of years (been working at the same place for almost 10 years, plus lifelong resident). It has made some of the work my crew does harder (since some areas are submerged deeper than usual and the Falls flow rate is increased). A significant amount of water is diverted away from going over Niagara Falls and into the hydro-electric power plant reservoirs, I can only imagine how much worse the water level would be if we didn't have that ability to control the flow rate and store the excess water for later use. A bit higher up the upper Niagara river, before the the water plunges over the falls and into the Niagara gorge, some neighborhoods located along the river have had flooding problems recently.  


 Here, there is a big controversial fight about the international treaty, Plan 14, between NY and Canada. The plan basically calls for the more of the water to be contained in Lake Ontario instead of diverted downstream through the Saint Lawerence river/Seaway and along Ontario's watershed, in order to prevent the city of Montreal from getting flooded out. So people in this region have come to believe that the reason why the lake and river levels have been increasing is due to a foreign city (Montreal) can benefit at their expense.  


But that's bullshit in my opinion, because the water level is high every where through out the Great Lakes. It's not just isolated to Lake Ontario and it's not like all that water is getting backed up through the Great Lakes just because of Montreal. I did my final university internship with a local soil and water conservation district (each NY county has a government organization that monitors the county's soil/water health). Every single stream, creak and spring's water level  in the county that we measured was up significantly higher than it has been historically. These streams, creeks and springs are directly flowing into the Niagara river and Lake Ontario. One main reason for the increased water level, is that we are still receiving about the same amount of precipitation through out the year, but the winters have become much more milder and warmer than they usually are historically. So all precipitation isn't getting stored as snow or ice through out the winter and slowly released in the spring/summer. It's just coming right down and melting right away into the watershed. The oxygen and flow rate were also both way up, while the turbidity was down, meaning that the rate of which the water is getting released into the watershed may also be way up high.

,Cleveland,2020-05,2020-05-13 12:44:21,1,B,"The reservoir in Tokyo is for flood storage so that the water doesn’t get released untreated after a huge rain. The reservoir you see in Cleveland is for storing drinking water, or for water that will be treated for drinking water. Cleveland also has a new network of flood storage tunnels under the city that serve the same purpose as Tokyo’s flood storage. 

Cleveland and most other older cities have separate sanitary and storm sewers, but the overflow channels for these are combined—so whenever we get a heavy rain, storm waters overflow and raw sanitary sewage gets mixed in with the storm water. Cleveland’s sewer plants try to treat the water, but usually the overflow would flood the treatment plants as well, so at that point storm water with raw sewage gets discharged into Lake Erie. One such outlet can be found on the dog beach at Edgewater Park. This is why Lake Erie is unsafe to swim in after a storm—because of the raw sewage discharged. The storage tunnels under the city are intended to hold the overflow water until after the storm, when the treatment plants will have capacity to pump them out and treat all the water. This will make Lake Erie way healthier, and not just to swim in. The phosphorus that feeds toxic algae blooms often comes from raw sewage...and even more from agricultural runoff...which is because they fertilize fields with the equivalent (or actual) of poop from animals.",2

Excessive phosphorus use from agriculture and residential use literally killed Lake Erie in the 60's.  

Your lawn really doesn't need much P, so if you alternate an application of milorganite with fertilizers that contain no P you slow down the P buildup and slow down the environmental damage.

P in soil only moves about an inch or two a year, so once your soil has enough P, you shouldn't apply any at all (except maybe a light dash of starter when you're seeding to get some P immediately next to the seedlings).  If you overdo the P, that also means it takes a few years to get levels under control.  

If you want organic fertilizer, just use one with little to no phosphorus.  If you like the period of dark green from massive iron application like milorganite uses, use ironite or a synthetic with iron added, like Scott's Green Max.

I like milorganite, it's good fertilizer, but it isn't the best one to use on lawns if you've already got enough P.",0

,funny,2020-05,2020-05-28 05:37:59,1,B,"There is actually good reason for it. Dog poop contains tons of harmful microorganism. When it rains, that poop breaks down, in whole or in part, and washes into the local water systems. If it is just going into the sewers and gets immediately recycled through water purification plants, it isn't as harmful since those plants will do massive cleaning. However, if you live in an area that is a watershed (such as the Great Lakes area), then you end up draining all of those microorganisms into the local water. Not only can this harm the local wildlife, it can also hurt people who use the water systems.

So, why is it a problem for dogs and not other animals? It ultimately is about what they eat. Dog food tends to be very nutrient rich, which causes their poop to contain high amounts of certain elements, such as phosphorus, which can cause harmful algal blooms. In fact, it was because of fertilizer run-off that there were some extremely serious algal blooms in Lake Erie several years back, which caused many places to be unable to drink the water due to the toxins present. 

Wildlife doesn't have this problem though because they keep a closed system, for the most part. Deer eat things right in the environment and then return those nutrients to it. Dogs eat food from outside of the environment and then put nutrient dense poop into it.

As well, this generally applies to cat poop. It is not recommended that cats be allowed to poop outside if possible, one of the many reasons to not let the genocidal bird killers... I mean cute furry things, outside unsupervised. As well, cat poop also contains parasites (T. gondii) as well which, when in the body of an animal they can't complete their life cycle in (e.g. humans), become dangerous.

Personally, I’ve only ever searched for sea glass (We call it beach glass where I live) in Lake Erie, one of the Great Lakes in North America.  I’ve found a few pieces similar to the shape in the picture above, but the majority of my pieces are the same as you stated- flat, some curved, many resembling pieces of bottles or plates.  This could be due to the fact that during the industrial era, many glass making companies dumped their glass into Lake Erie.  

It is possible that if many large chunks of glass were dumped into a body of water, over time they could form the pieces pictured above, but due to my past experience it makes me weary that so many pieces could be formed in such a similar fashion, especially with such rare colors.

That good ship and true was a bone to be chewed

Coming back from some mill in Wisconsin
As the big freighters go, it was bigger than most
With a crew and good captain well seasoned
Concluding some terms with a couple of steel firms

Of the wives and the sons and the daughters

In the rooms of her ice-water mansion
Old Michigan steams like a young man's dreams
The islands and bays are for sportsmen
And farther below Lake Ontario
Takes in what Lake Erie can send her
And the iron boats go as the mariners all know

In the maritime sailors' cathedral
The church bell chimed till it rang twenty-nine times

,collapse,2020-06,2020-06-16 15:22:47,1,B,"A school district in Beverly Hills, California, was saddled with a bill of at least $11 million to plug 19 oil wells on the property of its high school, after a judge in 2017 absolved Venoco LLC - the bankrupt company that had been operating the wells - of any responsibility for clean-up because other creditors took priority. The city of Beverly Hills is contributing another $11 million to the job.

“This is an incredible amount of money” siphoned away from education, said Michael Bregy, superintendent of the Beverly Hills Unified School District.

State and federal regulations normally require drillers to pay an up-front bond to cover future cleanups if they go belly-up. But the rules are a patchwork, with wildly differing requirements, and they seldom leave governments adequately funded. In Pennsylvania, for example, it would take several thousand years to plug its estimated backlog of 200,000 abandoned oil wells at the current rate of spending, according to data from the state regulator.

Oil-industry lobbyists have been fighting state and federal efforts to increase the bonding, arguing it would hurt jobs and economic growth during an already tough time for the industry.

“States and the federal government have many sources of funding available to reclaim and plug abandoned wells,” said Reid Porter, a spokesman for the American Petroleum Institute, the country’s largest oil and gas trade group.
The API spent $1.44 million in the first quarter of 2020 lobbying on Capitol Hill, with oil well bonding legislation one of the target issues, lobbying disclosures show.

The U.S. Government Accountability Office estimates that cleaning up and plugging an abandoned well runs from $20,000 to $145,000, **putting the price tag for cleaning up all of America’s abandoned wells somewhere between $60 billion to $435 billion.**

#‘SHOOTING OUT OF THE EARTH’

**The pollution threat goes beyond climate change. Leaks from abandoned wells have been found to contaminate groundwater and soil. In extreme cases, gas from abandoned wells has caused explosions.**

In Ohio and Texas, state regulators have each found an average of around two groundwater contamination incidents per year related to orphaned wells, according to research by the Groundwater Protection Council published in 2011 and dating to the 1980s.

In April 2017, for example, neighbors of Ohio farmer Stan Brenneman alerted him to the smell of oil coming from a drainage ditch on his 111-acre corn and soybean farm near the town of Elida, Brenneman told Reuters. The ditch drains water from the farm and carries it into rivers, streams and eventually Lake Erie.

Ohio’s Division of Oil &amp; Gas Resources Management excavated 800 feet of the farm’s drainage system to find a well casing - about 130 years old - releasing oil three feet underground. The plugging operation took two months to complete and cost the state $196,915, according to a spokeswoman for the state Department of Natural Resources.

More recently, in 2018, the U.S. EPA was alerted to the presence of nearly 50 abandoned oil and gas wells on Navajo Nation lands within the borders of Utah and New Mexico that were bubbling water at the surface. Tests showed the way from some of the wells contained potentially dangerous levels of arsenic, sulfate, benzene and chloride.

The Navajo Nation Environmental Protection Agency said plugging the wells would require “major funds” and that, in the meantime, the public had been warned not to drink the water.

In rare cases, gas from long-abandoned wells can cause dangerous accidents.

In January of last year, a 1930s-era well sent a geyser of gas and dirt 100 feet into the air at the construction site of a Marriott seaside hotel in Marina del Rey, California, an upscale community in the Los Angeles area, according to a state report. The hotel owners did not respond to a request for comment.

“It was horrifying,” said resident Marilyn Wall, who witnessed the explosion from her home across the street. She said she was stunned “by the extent and the length of time that the stuff was shooting out of the earth.”

A worker standing on a construction platform above the plume was sprayed with debris and scrambled to lower himself down with an escape rope, a video of the explosion shows.

#DON’T DRINK THE WATER

For Hanson and Michael Rowe, their troubles did not end the day their abandoned well was plugged. They no longer drink from the water well on their property because it gives them diarrhea, they said. Michael Rowe said she still suffers from headaches and coughing spells.

Kentucky’s Energy and Environment Cabinet is still fighting to recoup the $383,340 cost from the now-defunct J.D. Carty and Blue Energy in an ongoing court battle.

An attorney for John Carty, founder of J.D. Carty, said his client had sold what few assets remained in the company and therefore bore no responsibility. A lawyer for Blue Energy said the company denies ever operating the wells on the property and has no responsibility to maintain or plug them.

J.D. Carty was only required to have one $50,000 “blanket bond” to cover all its wells in Kentucky. The amount forfeited to pay for the leaky well on Rowe’s land, determined in part by its depth, was just $2,500 - less than 1% of the cost to fix it.

After the incident, Kentucky lawmakers passed a bill last year that effectively doubled bond requirements for shallow wells to help cope with the state’s 13,000 abandoned wells. Still, state regulators say the list of wells is growing.

Hanson Rowe said he supports fossil fuel development because using natural gas for heat and cooking has improved his quality of life. But the couple say they hope their lawsuit against the companies involved will help change the way the energy industry manages its wells.

“You lost your health, you’ve lost it all,” Hanson Rowe said.

&gt;The threat to avian wildlife from nuclear power plants can be divided into upstream and downstream fatalities.
&gt;
&gt;Upstream, uranium milling and mining can poison and kill hundreds of birds per facility per year. Abandoned open pit uranium mines in Wyoming have formed lakes hazardous to wildlife. Uranium-bearing formations are usually associated with strata containing high concentrations of selenium. For example, one of these pits killed 300 birds during a single year (US Fish and Wildlife Service 2008). Presuming this rate stayed constant, deaths at this mine therefore correlate to about 0.45 deaths per GWh.
&gt;
&gt;Like fossil-fueled power stations and wind farms, avian fauna can also collide with nuclear power plants. Three thousand birds died in two successive nights in 1982 from collisions with cooling towers at Florida Power Corporation’s Crystal River Generating Facility (Maehr et al. 1983). Given that the power plant now hosts an 838-MW nuclear reactor, and presuming it operated with a capacity factor of 90% and that the 3000 deaths were the only ones throughout the year, the facility was responsible for 0.454 avian deaths per GWh. Ornithologists observed 274 fatal bird collisions with an elevated cooling tower at the Limerick nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania from 1979 to 1980 (Veltri and Klem 2005). Since the Limerick plant has a 1200-MW reactor, and also assuming it operated at a 90% capacity factor, it was responsible for 0.261 deaths per GWh. At the Susquehanna plant in eastern Pennsylvania, 1500 dead birds were collected between 1978 and 1986 for an average of 187 fatalities per year (Biewald 2005). Assuming that the 2200 MW plant operated at 90% capacity factor, it was responsible for 0.01 deaths per GWh. Extensive surveys for dead birds were also conducted at the Davis-Bess nuclear plant near Lake Erie in Northern Ohio. Ornithologists recorded a total of 1554 bird fatalities or an average of 196 per year from 1972 to 1979 (Biewald 2005). Given that the power plant hosts an 873-MW reactor, and assuming it operated with a 90% capacity factor, and the plant was responsible for 0.0285 fatalities per GWh. Taking the mean for each of the four power plants results in 0.188 deaths per GWh. 
&gt;
&gt;The total avian deaths per GWh for nuclear power plants are therefore about 0.638.",0

Keep in mind algae is a very broad term that refers to wide variety of fresh and salt water organisms.

OP likely meant phytoplankton, which are an algae, and are negatively impacted by acidification.

Phytoplankton have calcium shells, which break down as acidity goes up, as well as produce a large portion (approx 50%) of oxygen on the planet through photosynthesis.

Phytoplankton are at the very base of the food web and preventing a collapse is crucial for the survival of humanity.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algal_bloom

&gt;The term ""algal bloom"" is defined inconsistently depending on the scientific field and can range between a ""minibloom"" of harmless algae to a large, harmful bloom event.[4] Since 'algae' is a broad term including organisms of widely varying sizes, growth rates, and nutrient requirements, there is no officially recognized threshold level as to what is defined as a bloom. 

&gt;Blooms are the result of a nutrient that the particular algae need being introduced to the local aquatic system. This growth-limiting nutrient is typically nitrogen or phosphorus, but can also be iron, vitamins, or amino acids.[3] There are several mechanisms for the addition of these nutrients in water. In the open ocean and along coastlines, upwelling from both winds and topographical ocean floor features can draw nutrients to the photic, or sunlit zone of the ocean.[10] Along coastal regions and in freshwater systems, agricultural, city, and sewage runoff can cause algal blooms.[11] Two examples of anthropogenic algal blooms in the United States are in Lake Erie and the Gulf of Mexico.[12]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plankton

&gt; Phytoplankton absorb energy from the Sun and nutrients from the water to produce their own nourishment or energy. In the process of photosynthesis, phytoplankton release molecular oxygen (O
2) into the water as a waste byproduct. It is estimated that about 50% of the world's oxygen is produced via phytoplankton photosynthesis.[30] The rest is produced via photosynthesis on land by plants.[30] Furthermore, phytoplankton photosynthesis has controlled the atmospheric CO
2/O2 balance since the early Precambrian Eon.[31]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytoplankton

&gt;The effects of anthropogenic ocean acidification on phytoplankton growth and community structure has also received considerable attention. Phytoplankton such as coccolithophores contain calcium carbonate cell walls that are sensitive to ocean acidification. Because of their short generation times, evidence suggests some phytoplankton can adapt to changes in pH induced by increased carbon dioxide on rapid time-scales (months to years)",0

&gt; Every year, an explosion of microscopic life reigns over western Lake Erie, forming a green slick of algae and bacteria so massive and vibrant that it can be seen from space.

&gt; [...] In 2014, it left 400,000 people without drinking water for three days after toxins infiltrated Toledo’s water system.

Lake Erie, despite being the shallowest and amongst the least in terms of volume, it provides the most drinking water out of the Great Lakes.

For example, I live in Buffalo, which is a city prone to lake effect snow storms. The storms come in from Lake Erie.

Lots of stuff goes to the toxic waste dump. But there are radioactive hot spots all over the county. Parts of the Manhattan project went to the dump.

Lots of nasty stuff that wreaks havoc on people, especially prolonged exposure. Hooker chemical used to have outlet pipes to the Niagara river (north of the falls where it lets out into lake Ontario) and the water was awful. That kind of dumping temporarily made lake Erie officially a dead lake. The zebra muscles actually helped clean the water a lot, after they were forced to stop dumping of course, but the sediment is still filthy. There are always warnings about going to lake beaches after storms. You're limited to eating one fish a month from the lake if I remember correctly, pregnant women have been warned to never eat lake fish.

Used to get an ear infection if you put your head under the water, according to the guy that taught me almost everything I know about sailing. He was related to the guy that owned hooker chemical, same last name. Grew up during the dumping. Sailing and swimming in that water since the late 50s, when he first started sailing.

So you're right that it's absolutely not *all* radioactive material. There's a lot of terrible shit. But there's absolutely nuclear waste in the dump. And spots that set off monitors all over, I'll try to find a video someone did with a news article about it. It was years ago, can't remember if it was buffalo news or not.",0
,CapitalismVSocialism,2020-01,2020-01-21 19:39:57,1,C,"&gt; you cant pollute without paying the price

To whom to pay price?

Consider what would happen if private firms were able to own the rivers and the lakes. If a private firm owned Lake Erie, for example, then anyone dumping garbage in the lake would be promptly sued in the courts for their aggression against private property and would be forced by the courts to pay damages and to cease and desist from any further aggression. Thus, only private property rights will insure an end to pollution — invasion of resources.

As factories began to arise and emit smoke, blighting the orchards of neighboring farmers, the farmers would take the manufacturers to court, asking for damages and injunctions against further invasion of their property. But the judges said, in effect, ""Sorry. We know that industrial smoke (i.e., air pollution) invades and interferes with your property rights. But there is something more important than mere property rights: and that is public policy, the 'common good.' And the common good decrees that industry is a good thing, industrial progress is a good thing, and therefore your mere private property rights must be overridden on behalf of the general welfare.""

I live near Lake Erie and we have had some issues with inconsiderate dog owners. One of the beaches is designated for people to bring their dogs but they need to be on a leash and the owners need to clean up after them. Unfortunately there was a problem with people bringing them to one of the beaches used by families with younger kids since the wave action is far mellower on that beach and there is more shade. There started to be an issue with shit being left on the beach so they ended the dog beach thing because nobody wanted to contend with dogs shitting on the beach where the kids were playing or dogs off leash barking/growling at people.

I've seen some people still bringing them into the park on the bay side so when I swim I stick to the open water part of the park where nobody brings kids or dogs. If there is shit in the water at least the wave action is enough to keep it seriously diluted.

We were actually better off playing in the swamp with the snakes and bullfrogs.)   Lots of air pollution as well as water pollution, as there was SO much industry going on back then.  But no one felt the need to wear masks ... maybe we should have done.  By the 1990s, I was a smoker, and had a group of roleplaying buddies.  At our busiest game, you could see eight people around a big table, 8 2L bottles of Coke, and 7 asthma inhalers (and one pack of smokes, but I took it outside, of course.)  All my friends were actually from out of town, and didn't develop asthma until they moved to Windsor.  Go figure.  (I've quit smoking.  My lungs collapsed while I was being operated on for a holey gut, and they said my lungs were basically utter garbage.  Two weeks on a breather cleaned 'em up real good, though, and a month in the hospital was a great start on The Patch, so I was able to quit, finally.  I also left that polluted shit-hole 20 years ago, and that solved a chronic migraine problem on its own ...)

The lake was at 36°F today (February 4th) which ties the record for daily temperature. Another alarming note about the lake is as of a few days ago, there was ice coverage totalling 0%. It is getting into mid-winter (or what should/used to be the middle of it) and I can't think of a time in my life that there was a ZERO for the amount of ice coverage. If anything it should be &gt;70% covered, and it wouldn't be abnormal to have it as high as 90%+ (If I can find a current estimate for ice coverage I'll edit this, haven't seen any measurement since this past Friday morning) Either last winter (2019) or the winter prior (2018) the lake was 100% frozen around now, give or take a couple weeks.

If a cold burst of air ever ends up coming through, coupled with winds out of the southwest, we are going to get HAMMERED with lake effect snow. Because Erie is wide open without any ice, there will be nothing to prevent the moisture from being absorbed from the surface. I'm interested to see if this pattern of freeze&gt;thaw&gt;freeze breaks and we get any ""normal"" winter weather, which would mean the snow on the ground lasts longer than 3 or 4 days. Our yearly snowfall average is 95""/241cm which we have currently a total of only 40""/~100cm.

Steelhead in the GL are non- native and were introduced in 1876 from McCloud River California steelhead and released into the Au Sable River. Several strains of mykiss have since been introduced and Little Manistee strain steelhead have been introduced into Lake Erie tribs ( Steelhead Alley)

Brown Trout in the GL are non native as well and were brought over from German brood stock in 1883 and released into the Baldwin River in 1884. Several different strains of brown trout have since been introduced. 

Atlantic Salmon and Brook trout are native GL species, although the Atlantics were nearly completely wiped out by overfishing snd habitat loss/pollution Reintroduced in The St Mary’s River in the early 1980s and planted in several other rivers in the last 5-7 years and are doing well.

In the winter, the humidity can be bad and make it seem more cold than it really is. It's just above freezing at 34° but with humidity and wind it feels like 25°.

In the winter, given the right conditions along Lake Erie (the most notable for lake effect snow), will result in lake effect snow. And one of those criteria? Good, upper atmosphere humidity and a good temperature variation between the lake and the atmosphere, which is entirely possible for a big lake of water up North in the winter.

The really sad part is climate change. After my city made the front page a few years ago for how much snow we get, we're now on par for a low snowfall year, and potentially a record low in ice extent along Lake Erie.

Only two other years since 1973 have had less in ice extent. I hope I turn out to be wrong, but as it stands it's at ~2.5% ice extent and was projected by NOAA to be at 80% by late February.",0

I mean, chemical contamination is still a major concern for this region, but as far as I know, it's not really new chemical pollutants being released that are the major problem of concern (since the DEC/EPA tightly regulate that and the various environmental watch dogs like the Waterkeeper and WNY Land Conservancy).

The main issues with chemical pollutants are the hot spots where toxic chemicals were released in the past (before regulations) and have been slowly been getting released into the water systems through leechate. I am talking about spots like the Buffalo River and parts of the Niagara River, Lake Ontario and Erie where the toxic chemicals are buried beneath the silt/soil layers deep down at the bottom of the waterways. The only way to really get that stuff removed is by dredging, sealing it with a clay liner or using certain plant species to absorb the waste.

Either way, I am all for the city of Buffalo to really step it up more than just the new Green Code and implement a multi-prong system for cleaning out the waterways by adding stuff to the city like these storm drain system catch nets, the trash water wheels and consistent litter clean up efforts.

,Ohio,2020-02,2020-02-28 14:40:59,1,C,"You may have heard of the Lake Erie Bill of Rights (“LEBOR”), an amendment to Toledo, Ohio’s City Charter that was passed in February 2019. But what is LEBOR? LEBOR is the latest effort within the United States to develop “rights of nature” laws, which declare that ecosystems like Lake Erie have their own fundamental rights. Relying on Ohio’s Constitution, LEBOR attempts to declare an immediate emergency within Lake Erie’s ecosystem based largely on Toledo’s concern for its drinking water, which comes from Lake Erie. You may remember that in 2014 the water supply to Toledo had to be shut down due to toxic algae blooms in Lake Erie caused by water pollution.
LEBOR was intended to permit Toledo, its residents, or Lake Erie itself to enforce the lake’s proclaimed right to exist, flourish, and remain a clean water source through lawsuits and refusing to acknowledge state or federal permits issued to any corporation that would infringe on Lake Erie’s rights. Its primary targets: farms, dairies, and industries with run-off or discharges to Lake Erie, even though these discharges are already regulated by state and federal laws.
LEBOR is not the first attempt to have the rights of nature recognized in the United States. In 1972, the United States Supreme Court considered whether nature or natural features should have rights, and correspondingly legal standing to enforce those rights, in Sierra Club v Morton.1 The United States Supreme Court held that environmental objects did not have legal standing to sue for their own preservation. Justice William O. Douglass penned the lone dissent, stating that “[c]ontemporary public concern for protecting nature’s ecological equilibrium should lead to the conferral of standing upon environmental objects to sue for their own preservation.”2
The day after LEBOR was approved by Toledo voters, an Ohio farm filed a federal lawsuit against Toledo. The State of Ohio joined the lawsuit alongside the farm, challenging LEBOR as both unconstitutional and preempted by state and federal law. Interestingly, a motion was filed by parties aligned with Toledo to permit the Lake Erie Ecosystem itself to participate in the lawsuit. The federal judged denied the motion, holding that Lake Erie lacked capacity to sue because the “rights of nature” legal concept is not recognized in the United States.
While the lawsuit is still ongoing, a preliminary injunction was issued stopping Toledo from formally adopting LEBOR as part of its City Charter and forbidding any enforcement actions or lawsuits pursuant to LEBOR until the case is decided. A motion to dismiss the lawsuit has been filed and should be heard in the coming months. In the meantime, other Toledo citizens have also filed a lawsuit against the State of Ohio requesting that LEBOR be found enforceable due to Ohio’s alleged failure to address pollution in Lake Erie.
While LEBOR will likely be struck down, these cases are worth keeping an eye on. Water quality concerns in Lake Erie will remain a hot topic in both Michigan and Ohio, and how to address Lake Erie’s pollution and algae blooms may affect Michigan agri-businesses in the future.

,Pennsylvania,2020-04,2020-04-02 17:31:32,1,C,"Here is info on the non-profit that that Rolling Stone chose to omit in their article:

-------------------------------
The Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund continues to target communities in Pennsylvania and Ohio for so-called Rights of Nature initiatives aimed at banning fracking and other regulated development activities. Initiatives similar to those that have appeared in Youngstown and the Lake Erie region in Ohio, as well as Grant Township and Potter County, Pa., have been rejected by several courts and voters, and proven costly for taxpayers.

Here’s what Pennsylvania and Ohio residents should know about the group behind the initiatives:

**What is the Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund (CELDF)?**

CELDF is a nonprofit law firm based in Mercersburg, Pa., west of Gettysburg. It offers communities “free” services to draft local ordinances and provide legal representation for the communities that pass them. Ordinances – which go by names such as “Community Bill of Rights,” “Rights of Nature,” “Charter amendments or home rule” initiatives – often fail or end up in litigation, with the costs for either outcome falling to taxpayers in those communities. CELDF started out fighting “factory farms” and has since set its sights on the oil and gas industry.

**Who is CELDF?**

Founder and Executive Director Thomas Linzey’s agenda is based on a dismantling of private property rights, as he made clear in a 2015 speech:

&gt; “If you are going to put all that work into a ballot initiative, why not do a ballot initiative that bans all finance companies in New York City from funding new projects that exasperate climate change? Why not do something real…why not do something real…cause people are saying to themselves, ‘it would be illegal, it would be unlawful, it would be unconstitutional, because you are taking their property’ well..(expletive), it’s time.” 

Additionally, in 2016 Linzey told audiences in Lancaster that “Pennsylvania’s constitution is a weapon for corporations,” and that it’s “time for a revolt.”

He’s not the only extreme voice in the group. In a 2015 meeting in Youngstown, CELDF National Organizer Ben Price told attendees that “we’re gonna make decisions in here that the rest of the community will just have to live with … It’s how it’s done!”

CELDF’s Pennsylvania Community Organizer Chad Nicholson, who hails from Spokane, Washington, has given numerous presentations, including one titled “Defying the Corporate State,” to communities across Pennsylvania.  Nicholson said in 2017:

&gt; “Let’s be clear: our state agencies, tasked with ‘environmental protection,’ are legalizing harmful activities by issuing permits to corporations with histories of violations. And, they are doing so against the will and sovereign law of the people who live in the community.”

Also in 2017, Nicholson said that “from the very beginning of this country’s founding with our Constitution that was written in 1787,” we “don’t really have a democracy to begin with, that it’s not just failing.”

CELDF’s Board of Advisors includes Gasland director Josh Fox; Karenna Gore, who is the founding director of the Center for Earth Ethics in New York and Al Gore’s wife; Rainforest Action Network founder Randy Hayes; former Pittsburgh city councilman Doug Shields; and other anti-industry activists.

**CELDF’s record**

CELDF does not have a winning record and its desire to prolong litigation even when it knows it has no chance of winning is well documented.  In 2018, a Pennsylvania federal judge reprimanded CELDF attorneys (including its founder and executive director, Thomas Linzey) for “bad faith” efforts to impose a ban on an injection well in Grant Township, Indiana County. U.S. District Court Judge Susan Baxter ordered the organization to pay $52,000 in legal costs and said in her ruling:

&gt;“This Court has determined that Attorneys Linzey and Dunne have pursued certain claims and defenses in bad faith. Based upon prior CELDF litigation, each was on notice of the legal implausibility of the arguments previously advanced…”

&gt; “Despite their own prior litigation, CELDF and Attorney Linzey, in particular, continue to advance discredited arguments as a basis for CELDF’s ill-conceived and sponsored CBR, and in doing so have vexatiously multiplied the litigation of this matter.” 

CELDF focuses on using litigation to drive conversation, regardless of the cost that these irresponsible cases can bring on municipalities and taxpayers. When asked about CELDF’s ultimate motivation, Reuters reported:

&gt; “Linzey says his goal is not to write local laws that are popular, or stand up in court, but rather to trigger a public debate about community rights to local self-government – even if it means a community ultimately falls into financial ruin.”

**Who pays for CELDF initiatives and legal costs?**

CELDF’s failed initiatives have already cost taxpayers in places such as Youngstown tens of thousands of dollars. Voters in the city recently rejected a CELDF ballot initiative for the eighth time. The costs to taxpayers doesn’t appear to bother Linzey, who said,

&gt;“If a town goes bankrupt trying to defend one of our ordinances, well, perhaps that’s exactly what is needed to trigger a national movement.” 

**Who funds CELDF?**

How can CELDF afford such repeated failure? It’s funded through foundations and private donations. They include the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, Heinz Endowments, Wallace Global Fund and others that actively support anti-fracking and anti-industry groups and initiatives.

**What is a “rights of nature” initiative?**

Linzey explained the organization’s “rights of nature” movement as:

&gt;“What is increasingly growing is a realization that for a real environmental movement to occur, ecosystems must have legally enforceable rights of their own.” 

CELDF has not been successful defending “rights of nature” initiatives in Pennsylvania. Most recently, following CELDF’s attempt to intervene in a lawsuit on behalf of the ecosystem, Judge Baxter ruled:

&gt;“As to the issue of whether the Little Mahoning Watershed, an ecosystem, has standing under the law, no determination need be made here. Clear and convincing evidence has not been produced to show that [the township’s] vigorous defense of the Ordinance, the terms of which protect the Watershed in all of its locations, do not line up precisely.” 

Baxter also explained,

&gt;“Although defendant wishes it were not so, the development of oil and gas (which necessarily includes the management of waste materials generated at a well site) is a legitimate business activity and land use within Pennsylvania.

&gt; …

&gt;“There is no state authority expressly granting a municipal government or its people the authority to regulate the depositing of waste from oil and gas wells or to invalidate permits granted by the state or federal government. Any provision enacted without underlying legislative authority is invalid and unenforceable.”

As recent years have demonstrated, CELDF will continue to advance its unlawful and unconstitutional agenda so long as wealthy foundations that fund the “Keep It In the Ground” agenda continue to provide the means for it to do so. And given CELDF’s dismal track record, taxpayers will continue to foot the bill for this folly.",0

Buffalo is much colder, wetter, snowier, windier, icier, with a phenomenon called ""lake effect snow"".  Furthermore, There are lingering effects that Buffalo suffers from as being one of the original rust belt cities.  Thus there are pockets of poverty and crime scattered throughout the city which don't exist in Roanoke.  (yes there are small areas of poverty in ROA, but not the miles of boarded up housing war zones I've experienced in rust belt cities up north.)

As far as the climate goes, there is no comparison.  West of  Buffalo, when Lake Erie experiences sunlight and evaporates, the evaporated lake water turns to snow and dumps itself onto shores and land east of Lake Erie (and Lake Ontario).  This can lead to a seemingly endless pummeling of snowfall for weeks and months.  I lived in Cleveland for 44 years, and it's what drove me out of the city (not to mention the increasing levels of poverty and crime) and it's probably what will badger you for the rest of your stay in Buffalo if you decide to live there. One particular winter the high temperature did not go above 29 degrees for 40 straight days, all with six to fourteen inches of snow.

I was looking for Great Lakes facts and just found that one (it’s 34% of the total surface area and 53% of the volume). Other fun (and less fun) facts:

* Lake Superior could submerge the Americas in 1 ft of water
* The Lorax (in 1971) referenced Lake Erie due to how badly the smallest Great Lake was polluted
* Lake Superior has a residence time of 200 years (the water leaving today could have flowed in around the year Napoleon died)
* In the 1960s, the lakes were stocked with game fish salmon to inspire tourism, but also to eat up alewives. Alewives had gotten so numerous that they died off in hoards - once burying the shoreline of Chicago in up to a foot of... rotting fish goop. (This actually worked out for a surprising amount of time, but non-native mussels worked from the bottom up and took out the alewives food supply.)",0

,IAmA,2020-04,2020-04-22 15:56:57,1,D,"Yes, I'm from the Bay Area as an Environmental Programs Manager and garbage can placement is HUGE. We have taken a page from Disneyland and tried placing our cans in closer proximity to each other AND in locations where people will likely have trash with them (e.g outside of restaurants, picnic areas, etc.). The problem is the cost of maintenance. All of those cans have to be emptied at least once a week, and the cost of installing them can be pricey (we once got a quote for 10 cans at 10k). So while adding more cans is the best, figuring out placement of what you have is a great BMP. 

You should give data driven results of litter reduction when cans are repurposed in new locations and the area of effect for each can (a little markers around the can on a map to show trash is reduced within this area).

Also I would add pet waste in your study for litter. Many agencies will have to come into compliance with F.coli TMDLs for their watersheds. Reducing pet waste has been shown to help in bringing that down (as well as reducing excess sediment and vegetation). Anyway, I love the idea and progress your team has made, keep up the good work :).",0

After awhile, corruption tends to eat away at anything.  Had it not been made and the city hadn't been forced into cleaning the river up, people never would have cared and it would have eventually polluted Lake Erie.  Like I said, you can choose to ignore what good it did do but I won't.  If you're unwilling to give credit where it is due then you're just being close minded.  If that agency still functioned the way it did when it was first started, we wouldn't even be having this discussion.

I personally don't blame the agency itself though or any other for that matter.  I hold the people that operate them as the responsible parties.  By your reasoning though, the state DID respect property rights.  Which is precisely why that river became so polluted.  They accepted it simply as a result of industrialization so long as jobs were booming there, they didn't give a shit what any of the companies did there as far as dumping waste.  They thoroughly believed those very companies would regulate themselves on their own properties.  Guess what?  They didn't do that until it was forced upon them and rightfully so in this matter.",0

I had lived within a couple blocks of the Maumee River most of my life and never seen a bald eagle on the river.

At that time I think there were only 8 nesting pairs in the entire state of Ohio, and the nearest nest to my town was 40 miles away at Ottawa Refuge on Lake Erie.

Currently, there are eagles nesting roughly every 5 miles along the Maumee River, and it is pretty much impossible to be along the river and not see one.


It shows what environmental protection, hunting regulation (the switch to steel shot stopped lead poisoning in eagles that ate wounded ducks), habitat protection, and public awareness can do.

Dayton was hit hard being that it is home to Wright Patterson AFB, which ironically wasn't hit very hard and continues standing and operating to help those in need

Toledo was hit by a couple bombs outside the perimeter, but remains standing as a trader town along the Maumee river and Lake Erie

I think waves are almost 100% dependent on wind on the Great Lakes. There are plenty of days I'm not brave enough to go out. On very windy days the waves can be six or eight feet high (I've heard reports of them being twice that, depending on what the bottom is like in the area).

,MapPorn,2019-12,2019-12-24 12:23:25,1,B,"I live near Lake Erie. We have miles of lovely beach. It's not white-sand ocean beach; it's dark-sand pebbly or rocky beach, or shale beach (which is quite different). Often it's low cliffs dropping to a narrow beach or right into the lake. It's completely gorgeous.

*Edit*: It's kayakable maybe half the year (south shore of Lake Erie), though for a couple of those months you'll need cold water gear to be safe. For three or four months of the year it's warm and amazing. I go out in shorts and a t-shirt, with my PFD when it's not like a glass mirror (otherwise, PFD strapped to the deck in arm's reach). During the summer months my challenge is to avoid sunburn and heat stroke. And when it's cold, it's really fucking cold. The beaches are still beautiful, if you're bundled up. The ice isn't some pretty sheet of white stretching to the horizon; because of pressure from farther out in the lake, what used to be our water turns into something like Superman's Fortress of Solitude: big, angular, jagged slabs of ice sticking up at odd angles, for miles and miles.

Yes, unregulated dumping is still a problem despite decades of cleanup and regulation efforts. It's generally safe to swim where I live, though this is partly (I've been told) because of invasive species like Zebra Mussels which filter the water so aggressively that they endanger native fish and plants. 

Cleaning up industrial, city, and farm pollution is an ongoing battle (but progressing, thank you, and much, much better than a couple of decades ago), but one of the worst pollution issues in freshwater lakes in North America, including all the Great  Lakes, is microplastics.

,unpopularopinion,2019-07,2019-07-03 00:11:50,1,B,"I beg to differ sir. I’ve been a hunter, fisherman, and gardener since I was a little boy. Sometimes you go out and come back with hardly nothing, but for a skilled woodsman such as myself (not to brag), those days are few and far between. The days that happens are outweighed by the days you come back with a large game animal or a pile of fish. Take this morning for example, I went fishing for about 5 or 6 hours and came home with 4 catfish, 3 drum, and a perch. That’s more than I can personally eat in one sitting by a lot, so if I was living off what I was able to collect from nature and nothing more I’d have had a surplus of food. When I do the math I made the calories I spent today back in an hour of fishing so I’d have had a lot of extra fish to smoke and keep for later. That’s fishing completely legally with my limit of 2 lines attached to 2 fishing rods at a time with a maximum of 2 hooks per line. No nets, no funnel traps, no trotlines or setlines, no shooting carp with my bow, nothing besides my legal limit of 2 fishing rods per fisherman in our polluted overfished waters of the modern era. Imagine if I could break the law and set a gill net or a trotline out. Imagine if I could shoot the passing ducks and geese and buzzards. Imagine if I could trap the woodchuck and the mink around the area. That’s just a public Lake Erie water access point with hundreds of boats going by per day and charter fisherman ripping up the fish populations. 


It’s hard to make ones living off the land, but it is natural. I find my job much more degrading than sitting on the side of the lake or “survival camping” with my buddy where we go out and only eat wild foods for a set period of time. I could do that shit every day. 


From my small, 1/8th of an acre garden I have been able to yield so far probobly 20 pounds of beans as well as some young diakon long radishes, I’d guess about 8 pounds of them. Imagine if I had all the time in the day to make that garden bigger with hand tools. Between fishing legally and gardening legally I could reasonably sustain myself. I’d harvest surpluses of fish when I could and smoke it to preserve it long term and sun dry vegetables I grow. Imagine if our earth wasn’t god knows how many degrees hotter than it’s supposed to be and the big Lake Erie actually still froze enough for icefishing. If that was the case I could reasonably feed myself off just fishing and gardening legally. I plan to return to wild nature one day, Michigan’s UP or Alaska, near the Innoko River. The laws won’t effect me when I do that. How do you think I’d be able to do? I’d venture to say I’d be eating pretty well",0

,nuclear,2019-07,2019-07-03 20:03:40,1,D,"&gt; People went to fossil fuels because ... renewables didn't exist yet.

What utter ignorant nonsense.&amp;nbsp; ""Renewables"" are the ORIGINAL energy source.&amp;nbsp; The first uses of wind and water power are lost in history, solar has always been used to dry food for storage (not to mention orienting buildings to capture warmth), and biomass is the raw material for that defining human invention, fire.

Muscle built the dikes which separated Holland's polders from the North Sea, but wind pumped the seawater out of them.&amp;nbsp; Don Quixote attacked ""renewable energy devices"" with his lance centuries before Newcomen and Watt.

The ""renewables"" were abandoned because, frankly, they suck.&amp;nbsp; Plants in general (let alone trees) just do not grow fast enough to provide for human energy needs; whole countries were almost denuded for firewood and building material.&amp;nbsp; And when coal was first being used as heating fuel, mines were pumped out with wind-powered pumps a la Holland when they were dug down to the water table.&amp;nbsp; Problem with that was, a calm stretch let the mines flood and nobody could work.&amp;nbsp; No work, no coal.&amp;nbsp; No coal, no money.&amp;nbsp; No money, no food.&amp;nbsp; Starvation really sucks.&amp;nbsp; So do lung disease and blindness from the smoke from indoor dung fires for cooking.

Do you begin to understand why steam power took off so fast, and why it was NOT driven by ""free"" solar energy?&amp;nbsp; A little time reading up on technological history could save whole societies from going over the cliff at the end of the romantic fantasy road.

&gt; Why can't we have solar, wind and storage, with nuclear peaker plants?

I'm assigning you some homework.&amp;nbsp; Calculate the average electric power demand of the USA (any figures after 2015 will do).&amp;nbsp; Assume a need of 2 months of storage to deal with seasonal surpluses and deficits of ""renewables"".&amp;nbsp; You are given the entire water volume of Lake Erie to use for pumped-hydro storage.&amp;nbsp; How high would you have to lift it to store the required amount of energy?

I'll give you a direct answer when you show some will to understand things on your own.&amp;nbsp; It'll make you appreciate the work that goes into informed opinions in these matters.

&gt; Is there no room for solar or wind in the power mix?

If you have to cover for dark/cloudy and calm conditions, you're going to need other energy period.&amp;nbsp; If you're not saving emissions by not using this other energy, what's the point in not using it all the time instead of the ""renewables""?&amp;nbsp; They become an expense without a benefit.

&gt; Is it necessary to go 100% nuclear to satisfy you?

No.&amp;nbsp; If you have certain classes of dispatchable loads, you can make use of plenty of intermittent, unreliable energy.&amp;nbsp; You just can't use them for much else, or rather, if you're not really saving anything then there's no point.

Among the things that ""renewables"" are mostly useless for:  
* Municipal water and sewage treatment  
* Food refrigeration, preparation and delivery  
* Powering industry like steel mills and semiconductor fabs  
* Keeping EV batteries charged (waiting for the wind to blow before you can drive to work is a non-starter)  

If you can convert today's short-term excess of electricity or heat into something that's both compact and easily stored for weeks or months, you can make use of unreliable energy.&amp;nbsp; I lean toward methanol/dimethyl ether as storage media for that exact reason.",0

Good question, actually. We all share a climate but we do not all share the same level of access to resources and infrastructure.

However growing up the big difference came when school was canceled for different reasons. When I was younger it was because of the amount of snow we got, I remember measuring a snow drift in my yard as 1.2 meters. There would be so much snow the school buses could leave the parking lot and without transportation schools had to call off. More recently however we have been hit with Polar Vortexes starting around 2012 or 2013. Base temperatures reached -35C with windchills making it feel even colder.

However, the issue with that term is that the [dumbest people on the planet](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/02/26/jim-inhofes-snowball-has-disproven-climate-change-once-and-for-all/?utm_term=.a1d8326a5778) think that it means that holding up a snowball is proof that it's wrong.  They conflate ""weather"" and ""climate"" as it suits them.  In fairness, layman climate change advocates also sometimes make the same mistake in blaming a particular heat wave on climate change.  The shift to ""climate change"" does better describe the effects of global warming, which go beyond simply ""it's more hot"".  


One example I read was that in 2006, for the first time in recorded history Lake Erie didn't freeze.  That ended up resulting in GREATER lake-effect snow than usual because there was more moisture in the air.  I'm not saying that proves climate change, but it's just a possible example of the sort of consequence that CAN result that might not be as clear to describe as ""global warming"".   


I fucking hate the ""the climate changes naturally so we shouldn't do anything"" argument.  It's in bad faith.  It's like saying that the fucking Vancouver teen couldn't have started the Eagle Creek fire because forest fires happen naturally all the time.  Or ""I don't own lightbulbs because night happens all the time"".  The fact that weather and climate change is not evidence that mankind cannot influence it.

And here's the thing:  people spouting that bullshit don't know what they're talking about. They aren't scientists.  You know how we know that the climate has undergone periods of heating and cooling over hundreds of thousands of years?  Because the same fucking people that are telling us that manmade CO2 emissions are altering the climate told us - climatologists.  It's absurd to think they haven't taken that into account.

&gt;From 1,000 feet / 300 m below Lower Harvard Bridge to Newburgh and South Shore Railroad Bridge, the channel becomes wider and deeper and the level is controlled by Lake Erie. Downstream of the railroad bridge to the harbor, the depth is held constant by dredging, and the width is maintained by piling along both banks. The surface is covered with the brown oily film observed upstream as far as the Southerly Plant effluent. In addition, large quantities of black heavy oil floating in slicks, sometimes several inches thick, are observed frequently. Debris and trash are commonly caught up in these slicks forming an unsightly floating mess. Anaerobic action is common as the dissolved oxygen is seldom above a fraction of a part per million. The discharge of cooling water increases the temperature by 10 to 15 °F / 5.6 to 8.3 °C. The velocity is negligible, and sludge accumulates on the bottom. Animal life does not exist. Only the algae Oscillatoria grows along the piers above the water line. The color changes from gray-brown to rusty brown as the river proceeds downstream. Transparency is less than 0.5 feet / 0.15 m in this reach. This entire reach is grossly polluted",2

Unsafe pollutant and bacteria levels killed off a short-lived public beach at Times Beach in the 1950s.   The Buffalo River was essentially a sewer at the time, and Times Beach was too close to its mouth.  

Chicago never industrialized the shoreline north of the South Shore neighborhood.  The Lake Erie shoreline was solidly industrialized down to Hamburg.  South of that, most of the shoreline has private ownership.  There’s a few state parks, and a lot of town resident-only beaches, but the land just isn’t there for Chicago or Milwaukee-style lakefront parks.  

What about the NFTA land?  The breakwall stops most longshore sand flow that could accumulate for a beach.  Remove the breakwall, and you remove safe harbor for any boats — lake freighters or bowriders — in a storm.

NYS is VERY strict when it comes to managing waterbodies and hydrological resources. Even if there was a place for a groin to collect sand, it would be very difficult to build today, because it would alter Lake Erie’s natural shoreline.  Never mind that two centuries of industrial activity already altered it beyond recognition.

I’m not saying it’s impossible.  Im saying you’d have to get really, REALLY creative to get a Chicago-style lakefront in Buffalo.  Also, maybe wait a couple hundred years for total waterfront deindustrialization, land acquisition, financing. and waiting out the half-life of what’s in the muck.",0

Nobody's really tried to upgrade it to a big enough scale to provide all our energy storage needs, but eventually they will have to. It's easily got the potential to provide all the storage we need, it just needs some investment to make it happen. And once the demand and requirement for storage is there, I think the investment will quickly follow.

Lake Erie is already the biggest pumped storage reservoir in the world, but we only use the tiniest sliver of its actual capacity because there's no need for more, at least no need that anyone is willing to throw money at and there's a big tourist attraction in the way. The normal, natural variation range of Lake Erie's water level represents about 11 Terawatt-hours of stored energy. Enough capacity to power the entire world for over 6 months, without even pushing the lake beyond its normal shorelines, high or low. The generation and pumping capacity you would need would be enormous, but the physical capacity in the reservoir is easily available. The energy is being stored and released whether we choose to take advantage of it or not. Niagara Falls eats more hydroelectric energy every day than the entire world uses. It is certainly beautiful, and historically significant, but is it worth destroying the rest of the planet simply to avoid more completely harnessing that monster?

- You have a rich history. Businessman wants to build a canal from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario to bypass the falls. He fails, leaves it half finished, moves out of the state. The unfinished canal becomes a swimming hole/park for kids and families
- Chemical plants and other industry pop up in Niagara falls. Pollute like crazy. Dylatov-like figures just say that it's fine.
- City Government desperately want to rezone and develop residential/school stuff where the chemical plants are
- Chemical plants actually suddenly become good, discouraging the transaction. City government insists, eventually gets land. 
- School is built near major underground waste storage. Playground built on top of it. Heavy machinery chew up the concrete containing everything
- Happy neighborhoods pop up
- 20 years later, after snowy winter, wet spring, literal barrels float up out of the ground and into people's backyards
- Lots of illness
- Drama ensues as people protest, others deny, and eventually officials are kidnapped and held hostage until something is done.

Hey, you're right. That's what I get for going off memory

&gt; The plants are not beyond their operating life. The Perry plant hasn't hit it's original license expiration.

Again, I was thinking about Davis-Besse. Which did have it's original license run out. The NRC made 40 year operating licenses, because at the time, that was how long they thought they would run, hence the end-of-life comment.

However yes, they did just get a license renewal. Apparently, the NRC does believe that engineering advancements over the past 40 years means that they can continue operating them safely. But, IMO, the NRC is abdicating their regulatory duties here. According to the Wikipedia article (and the line is cited too), the NRC has determined that 2 of the 5 worst safety incidents have happened there. Given that it's a Gen 2 reactor and can't passively cool itself, the NRC IMO should be shutting this plant down to punish FirstEnergy, not giving them another 20 years to potentially fuck up Lake Erie and Northern Ohio with a reactor that has known design issues and is run by a shitty company.

The history of the area is fascinating: Native Americans called the river: Cuyahoga- means crooked river. There’s a continental divide in Akron that turns the river north where it empties into Lake Erie; yes, it’s the one that caught fire. There are horseback riding trails, mountain biking trails and the towpath trail. 

Yes, the OHIO &amp; Erie Canal went through here and parts of the trails follow that path. The flood of 1913 ended the canal; however, the floods were due to storms that crossed the entire Midwest and ruined many communities. 

In Akron there is a marked path along the street called Portage Path; 50 bronze arrowheads mark the actual trail. In the Valley there’s a huge bronze Indian statue where they pulled their canoes out to portage them 8 miles to the Portage Lakes where they could get to the Tuscawarus River and eventually the Ohio. 

Stan Hywet is along Portage Path in Akron. It was built in 1913-15 by the Seiberling family who founded Goodyear. 65,000 sq ft mansion with 28 fireplaces, indoor swimming pool, fantastic gardens, birch allee and glass conservatory. The pipe organ in the music room has pipes that are 3 stories tall. It opens April 1 each year. Seiberling’s grandson helped create Cuyahoga Valley National Park. 

If you go into downtown Akron, Lock 3 has a Children’s Museum and ice skating in the winter; concerts in the summer. If you go on the trail behind the Rubber Ducks baseball stadium there is an outline of a towpath barge that is outlined in metal. It gives a great idea of what travel was like. 

Summit Metro Parks co-manages some of the trails like Deep Lock Quarry. It’s where they got a lot of the stone for the locks. The Mustill Store is in Akron and along the Towpath Trail. It’s one of the earliest stores still around. 

The Conservancy for Cuyahoga Valley National Park partners with the National Park and provides lots of great programming. They’ve helped fund a new visitors center soon to be open. W
Hen government shutdowns occur, programming still happens through the Conservancy. 

Boston Mills is a small town in the middle of the National Park. At one point, the bank there had the highest deposits of any bank in the US. The gas station is now an art venue.

If a person volunteers to go Green. Then they are a free rider trying to solve the problem of global warming, which is a tragedy of the commons. Going green is the social martyrdom of the people who's work indirectly supports those who refuse to solve the problem. Such that by doing nothing you are better of than people who are doing something as long as someone is doing something. So it would be more economical for individuals to do nothing and let others pay for the cost. 

This is why we tax pollution. Because global warming is an externality and all costs must be paid eventually. The discussion of individual accountability is pointless. We need enforcement to ensure that we don't rely upon free riders, and to limit damage done through the tragedy of the commons exploiting them. It is not an individualist problem, it's not even limited to a single nation either. It's a global crisis. Right now nations are playing a game of brinkmanship with the future of the world because few nations want to be a free rider. 

An excellent example of the problem is the history of the Great Lakes and pollution. To which the largest sources of fresh water in the world has been polluted to the point of making lake Erie and Michigan dying seas. The lakes were free places to dump waste. With just a small amount of waste there was no problem and no need to enforce anything. However over time there were more and more sources of pollution. Too many for the lakes to manage for us all for free. If we let keeping the lakes alive be voluntary, then they would be dead by now because that situation was what allowed the problem to develop and not resolve itself in the first place. Even now they aren't doing that much better off about 50 years after Nixon, but at least they aren't entirely dead. 

My argument is that enforced action is required and that's all that will be effective. Voluntary action is going to be ineffective. Because at this point in this problem there are too many individuals exploiting the free ride of the earth's temperature management.",0

The Cuyahoga River ( KY-ə-HOG-ə, or  KY-ə-HOH-gə) is a river in the United States, located in Northeast Ohio, that runs through the city of Cleveland and feeds into Lake Erie. As Cleveland emerged as a major center for manufacturing, the river became heavily affected by industrial pollution, so much so that it ""caught fire"" at least 13 times, most famously on June 22, 1969, helping to spur the American environmental movement. Since then, the river has been extensively cleaned up through the efforts of Cleveland's city government and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA).

The country seemed to face existential threats on all fronts. The economy was a mess - people were paying credit card-level rates on *mortgages*. The Great Lakes were so polluted that one of them actually caught on fire. Crime was *unbelievably* high.

The ocean may give you a gentle feeling of floating up on on a wave, into the trough, then up on the other side in a very smooth motion. Lake Erie though can be like being in a washing machine.  I cringe seeing open jon boats 4 miles off shore, no life jackets, bouncing up and down on the waves.  One errant wave and the boat will flip (I think most have flotation compartments, but still).

As for recreational boater traffic, though it's a lot of fun on Labor Day (Air Show) and July 4th fireworks on the lake, the drunk to sober ratio peaks during those times and boat traffic can get nuts.  I stay away from the lake on those two days. 

On the plus side, drive your boat directly North on a summer night. Keep going till Cleveland drops out of sight and there's nothing but stars and a faint glow to the South.  It's magic.",0
,politics,2019-09,2019-09-13 13:20:59,1,B,"Polluted agricultural runoff is the leading source of water pollution in rivers, lakes and well water. The pesticides in runoff can seep into people's water supply when using well water. The runoff can also build up in fish, which can expose people who eat the fish to high levels of chemicals. Polluted agricultural runoff can also trigger harmful algae blooms in coastal waters. 

In the 2000 National Water Quality 
Inventory, states reported that agricultural nonpoint source (NPS) pollution is the leading source of water quality impacts on surveyed rivers and lakes, the second largest source of impairments to wetlands, and a major contributor to contamination of surveyed estuaries and ground water.

,stopdrinking,2019-09,2019-09-13 22:49:55,1,E,"ok, over the last 5ish years, even when i was drinking heavily every day, i used to try to go on tinder dates sober. we didnt go to bars or anything of course, that wouldnt have made sense. i usually tried to convince girls to grab lunch with me, or coffee, and some of the best were convincing them to go on a bike ride with me - my friend always let me borrow her bike for this purpose. i love riding bikes and i cant recommend that kind of date enough, especially if you live somewhere you can pick the person up, then drive to a parking spot to unload bikes and ride down a path to go grab a bite to eat in a few miles of riding. Then ride a little bit more and take a break to sit down and talk on a bench or wherever (i had a grassy incline along the bike path id always love to stop and sit at and look at the city skyline). Then ride home, give her a hug or kiss goodnight. Excellent date. I highly recommend. Even when i was drinking 1.5L of vodka every day, i still went on dates sober (the problem was leaving the date and driving to the liquor store and going home with a bottle afterward - thats the part that needs left behind).

Another fun sober date i had was along lake erie, there is a wetlands area along the water w/ boardwalk trails. we went on a walk and checked out the local wildlife, enjoyed views of the wetlands and the lake at other points, it was great. this was also while i was drinking heavily, but i was sober until i dropped her off after that. great experience, again, just need to cut out the alcohol use afterward

I did do plenty of drunk dates within that time period too, They actually always failed. I never once saw a girl again after a drunken night w/ a girl i met on tinder, and that happened maybe 7 or 8 times in the past 5 years.

the point of telling these stories is that sober dates are BETTER, and i hope all of you guys here arent worried about having to do sober dates now after stopping drinking. The sober dates are the good dates!",0

,law,2019-09,2019-09-14 01:34:32,1,B,"&gt;Further, the coverage is touting “pollutant” in laymen’s terms without elaborating on what the CWA treats as a pollutant. They make it seem as if a pollutant is always some form of a dangerous chemical. 

I didn't get that impression, but I also studied environmental science and the CWA specifically and understand how impactful pollutants like excess sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorus are to aquatic ecosystems. 

&gt;Most pollutants that end up falling under the term are gravel, rocks, dirt, sand, or other sediment that are adjacent to the “water way” anyway. Certain rock and gravel is often used for land loss prevention as a protection for further erosion. 

Just because they are useful in some areas doesn't mean they aren't incredibly harmful in other areas. Wetlands aren't high erosion zones like river banks or shorelines, and the deposition of sediment will fill in wetlands over time and smother plants. Remediation for this is *insanely* expensive and is often too little too late. The is a reason that the watersheds for the Chesapeake Bay all have TMDLs for sediment: it is a pollutant of major concern even if it won't directly make you sick. Other ""not scary chemicals"" like excess nutrients are extremely disruptive and damaging for aquatic ecosystems like wetlands.

So it's true that ""pollutant"" doesn't necessarily refer to things like lead but that doesn't mean that we shouldn't be concerned about the impact the changes will have on wetlands.

&gt;There are contaminated and polluted “wetlands” across the US that are waiting to be remediated, but the landowners either can’t secure the proper permit from the Army Corp of Engineers or have to spend millions of additional dollars to appease the ACE’s and EPA’s supervision requirements and clean up specifications.  

What landowners are trying to spend tens to hundreds of thousands remediating wetlands but being stopped by regulations? Even if that is a problem, there are other ways to go about addressing it than rolling back protections like this. I guarantee you that there are far more land owners looking to develop and pollute wetlands.",0

I assume you believe they constitutionally wrong to do so because of the 10th amendment?  In my opinion the commerce clause (Art. 1, section 8) allows the federal government to regulate environmental standards as one State's lack of standards could impact the well being of another State.  For example, Michigan decides to just dump everything and anything into the Detroit River/Lake Erie.  Michigan doesn't care, they only have a small portion of Lake Erie in their border.  But Ohio, PA, NY, and Ontario do care because this affects their fishing and tourism economies.  The federal government needs to come in and set a universal standard that appeases all states and a foreign entity.  

Now the commerce clause has been strengthened over the centuries by the courts, and you may disagree with that, but as we are a common law country, their rulings shape the law today.  You may also feel that the executive should not have the power to solely enact federal environmental regulation.  I agree, but since Congress has steadily been giving up their power to the executive over the last century, you have to work with what you got.  I would love if Congress took back from power from the executive, but given the train wreck that is DC, I doubt that will happen anytime soon. 

Since environmental standards are extremely important, and impacts the economy, well-being, and general welfare of all people and States, it must be the role of the federal government to set a standard, and the states may enforce a higher standard per the 10th amendment.",0

3) Then there are microbial sources that, while they won't kill you, can make you ill if you aren't used to them. ""Montezuma's Revenge"", for example. The water is ""safe to drink"", but since your body isn't used to it, you get sick

,carnivore,2019-09,2019-09-24 13:01:09,1,B,"Cool, that sounds like a fun class. Anyway, I'd recommend not thinking about it as a veganism = bad for the environment carnivore = good, because its not that simple. If people want to do what is best for the environment then that is going to mean buying local as that will minimize the amount of energy required to get that food from the farm to your plate. 

The thing is that its very hard to do a vegan diet by just eating locally grown plants, especially for certain parts of the year. 

In addition to the energy required to farm, there is also the problem of run-off from fertilizer on farms that can harm the ecosystem. For example Lake Erie has been dealing with this problem lately. The rain comes and washes the fertilizer and such into the water system which goes into lake erie, lake erie then has a boom of nitrogen which causes a spike in the algae population which makes the water toxic to a lot of the native species and can make the water undrinkable. Specifically this year Toledo's water was not drinkable for a period of time. 

Now that is a problem with farming practices in general, not with a vegan diet in particular. A lot of plants grown in the US go to animal feed or to energy production, especially most of the corn in the midwest. 

Do what you will but I'd focus on making the argument that the vegan philosophy places minimizing animal suffering above human health and environmental health. And then make the argument that minimizing animal suffering and improving environmental health are at times at odds with each other, enter arguments for ruminant animals on pastures helping trap carbon in the soil and whatnot. If you really want to go after veganism. 

But as I said before, as for the environment its about buying local. But [according to this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/13/dining/fruit-vegetables-imports.html) over half of fruit and a third of vegetables come from outside the US. The article also states that over 80% of seafood is imported.

You’re right, I don’t deny that fact, that’s why it is listed on the MLS and with an actual agent. 

Allow me to share my theory.

I love the fact that everyone quotes these TV shows, before they take the time to actually evaluate and think about the various types of disasters folks are prepping for. Not everyone is prepping for of “economic collapse” or “break down of society and law and order” again TV words. 

But perhaps some are prepping for that environmental disaster, that is looming, you know global warming, melting ice caps, rising sea and ocean levels, maybe some are already living it, such as those folks behing flooded out on a weekly basis at the Lake Ontario and Lake Erie areas. But they need a second option, or maybe they need a waypoint between locations.  

Or perhaps they need an area that is between 1800 to 2000 feet above sea level, and an area with a variety of farms both vegetable and animal from with one may choose to barter with, and also wild life again both plant animal and fungi, then perhaps it will make sense. Not to mention some dangerous roads during inclement weather

As for the close to “large population centers,” lol I love that phrase, most preppers don’t got the funds to prep, therefore they need those large population centers to keep their jobs, while considering that they need a bug out location that is within 200 to 300 miles from that city center, because that’s the average mileage per tank of “fuel” in every vehicle in America, but who fills up their tanks anyways right. 

So considering the natural resources, distance from the interstate, and major roadways, inaccessibility of certain areas, mountain passes, and farmers- ‘Mercia loves us our farmers, cause most of us have not got a single green thumb in our body much less our families. 

So yes your theory is extremely feasibly, but that doesn’t deny the fact that people still live in New York State, oh and by the way, considering that every state has a lock down procedure for their borders currently, well my theory is a feasible one also.",0

The Cuyahoga River ( KY-ə-HOG-ə, or  KY-ə-HOH-gə) is a river in the United States, located in Northeast Ohio, that runs through the city of Cleveland and feeds into Lake Erie. As Cleveland emerged as a major center for manufacturing, the river became heavily affected by industrial pollution, so much so that it ""caught fire"" at least 13 times, most famously on June 22, 1969, helping to spur the American environmental movement. Since then, the river has been extensively cleaned up through the efforts of Cleveland's city government and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA).

We were born into the expectation of a full nuclear exchange between Russia and the US. 

&gt;In my elementary school from the first grade to the fifth we practiced getting under our desk when the civil defense sirens or a planned bell went off every couple of months.

CBS’s news anchor Walter Cronkite and his like had scientist on once a week (we all watched the news, it was terrifying fun) telling us that the increase in population was unsustainable. We pppsaw tapes of people already starving by the millions in India, and China was worse. Soon the whole world could be starving as the population reached unsustainable numbers. Civilization itself would collapse before the year 2000 as starving immigrants flooded the first world countries.

Pollution in the US was as bad as China today. Lead was thick in the air and contaminated rivers were catching on fire. In 1970, the great Lake Erie was declared dead, void of all life due to pollution.

Not as bad as the 1966 headline of the prestigious Time Magazine asking a very religious nation in a hopeless time, “Is God Dead”?

The Ozone hole was in there somewhere, at point X it would kill us all.

Not a lot of assassinations today, but:

A President was shot in 1963, Malcom X in 65, Kennedy and MLK in 1968. Multiple riots burned big inner cities to the ground and the political wars made today look like a pillow fight.

The 1970’s economy was a cluster. Inflation over 10%, mortgages higher than 15%, no chance we were ever going to have it as easy as out parents. The President had a serious speech and said the country was in a malaise.

In 1977 I learned the World was going to completely run out of oil by the year 2000. No tractors gas to feed the starving in America , no cars, no 18 wheelers to distribute food. In the real world gasoline lines were over 2 hours long. When we are out of gas in 2000 Societies would collapse, yada yada you know the drill.

Now we learn just a few big Nukes will cause a worldwide nuclear winter. Human Extinction possible.

Jump forward only because I’m tired. 

The Aids virus was devastating. It would soon kill heterosexuals at the same rate per 1000 as it was killing Homosexuals. If you have been with multiple people you are possibly already infected. Being diagnosed was a certain death sentence, and like we hear with Coronavirus, when critical mass is hit in the heterosexual community we will run out of people, care facilities and body bags to comfort and bury the dying.

The Y2K predictions were from disaster to apocalyptic.

You get my drift. Coronavirus is real. Climate change is real, but we have been crawling under the desk waiting for the bomb to fall since the first day we can remember.

Here are some really smart English baby boomers as 13 year olds in 1966 predicting the future of the year 2000.

,londonontario,2020-03,2020-03-26 01:18:46,1,D,"The Legend of Hell’s Gates

The area of Lake Erie from Long Point to close to Port Stanley, Ontario,  holds many dark tales.  During the War of 1812, American raiders came from all directions to pillage, burn and loot.  From the Grand River to Point Pelee they left a deep psychological impact on the people and the land, so much so that even today no major Canadian city exists on the north shore of Lake Erie, in direct contrast to the large American cities on the south shore of the Lake.

	One grim lake tale plays out around a thickly tree-lined country lane near “Saulter’s Gulley” which runs off the Nova Scotia Line between Port Bruce and Port Burwell, beside the pioneer cemetery of Grovesend. The lane ran down to the high cliffs overlooking Lake Erie.  Halfway down the lane one can still see the mysterious 1870's “traffic circle”.  At the end of the lane, perched a mansion close to the cliff edge a little past two huge stone gates. These gates would become commonly called “Hell’s Gates”; they were “The Entrance to Hell” because so many who dared go through them would disappear, never to be seen again.  With time and erosion, the mansion crumbled into the lake, leaving only the gates  which stood for many years, until more time and more erosion claimed them, too.

	For many years I talked to locals and heard several versions of this story, an though they vary from person to person, the basic elements stayed true.   However the origin of the intense fear of the place took me many years to track down, and the answer came from an older man who wished to remain anonymous.   While I can never prove conclusively what I am to tell you, I personally feel satisfied with the origin of “Hell’ Gates”.

	Around the crumbling mansion and the Gates grew a local Unrequited Love and Ghost story which itself gave way to many versions, depending on who was doing the story telling.  The basic “story” is, I believe, is founded on an actual 1870's conflict within a local  church congregation resulting in  a bitter split among its members.  The Split was solved when the church burned; some of the day called it arson. Two new churches were built to accommodate the arguing factions, one on the original site with its original graveyard, a new one on a new site with a new graveyard.  Although one of the churches are gone, the cemeteries still exist, but for historical note, neither of these two cemeteries are the Grovesend cemetery. 

&amp;#x200B;

	 Also divided were the families of the original congregation, two in particular.  A young woman from one group and a young man from the other group were in love. She was forbidden to see him again.  (1)With broken heart, she flung herself off the cliff near the mansion, to her death.  Or (2) She was killed by the jilted lover she was forced to leave.  The motive for her death is also subject to debate,  some local folklore  claiming she was in a “family way.”  She was, factually,  laid to rest in neither of the newer cemeteries but the original pioneer cemetery beside Saulter’s Gully/ Grovesend, which, to this day, according to continuing reports, she haunts, wandering in sorrow.  

	Others say it’s not her sobbing from the cemetery that they hear, but her lover moaning deep into the night as he  trods up and down along Saulter’s Gully, just as he did in life, in the dark of the night so as not to be seen, long into his old age, his guilt bearing down on him both in life and since, in death.   The fact that she was not buried in either of the newer church operated cemeteries, or what could be seen as “hallowed ground”  lends support that some something terrible happened and this was far from a natural death.

Today the long lane to the cliff edge where the mansion once stood is blocked by a wide gate and a large “No Trespassing” sign which is kept in good repair.

	During the American Prohibition years, circa 1920-1933, this Unrequited Love/Ghost story was given a different twist and took on a new life.  Added to the mournful lovers haunting Saulter’s Gulley was a ghostly apparition whose face could be seen in the bark of a large trees near the mysterious “traffic circle” halfway down the lane. The description of this “ghost” resembles the “Green Man” of pagan Celtic deity,  tradition possibly repeated by the first Scottish settlers who pioneered here circa 1803.  It was said that, should one venture down the lane one would see the ghostly face in the tree and, if it smiled one could continue unharmed, but, if it frowned, something terribly lay ahead.

	Ten years of conflicting research of these stories came to a partial realistic end when, some years ago, I met an elderly gentleman who, as a young child, had spent time in the old mansion and  had seen “the goings on”.  During the Prohibition years, he said, the mansion was a major meeting and transfer site for smuggling Canadian liquor across Lake Erie into the U.S.  

	Another part of this “ghost story” survives today on the internet is the “Lake Erie Triangle”, modeled after the famed “Bermuda Triangle”, which covers roughly Erie, PA to Cleveland, OH up to the north shore of lake Erie, ranging from Port Stanley to Long Point, depending on whom you talk to.  The area of lake Erie just off Erie, PA itself is sometimes referred to as “The Graveyard of Lake Erie” because of the many shipwrecks in that area over the years. Factually there has been periods of mysterious disappearances of small boats and ships over the years, but after talking some time ago to members of the Eire County Historical Society, they point out that many of the “strange disappearances” happened during Prohibition years  and that Erie, PA was a major port for incoming Canadian bootleg liquor.   The gentleman who told me the original story backed that point up.  According to him, violence was not uncommon on water or land, either side of the lake.

	So it came to be the bootleggers and smugglers of the time either knew or learned of this old ghost story and adapted it to help scare off the curious.  But the original story itself wasn’t always enough, it had to be supplemented by something more sinister - thus, The Face in the Tree.  This was, of course, the constant look-out who was hidden in the trees at the old “traffic circle” in lane.  When I asked if the lookout was to watch for the authorities, the old gentleman scoffed at me and said bootleggers had those folks well paid off, “And besides” he snorted, “We had bigger guns than them.  It was the other gangs who were the real danger.”   

	So I asked the old man “What was the something terrible that awaited down the lane if the face frowned instead of smiled at you?”  “Well”, he said, “let me put it this way; Lake Erie is a big place to try to find a person”.

	A good historian should be able to document and prove their thesis, however for obvious reasons, this is one I will never be able to do so.  The reader is to make up their own mind.   What is most interesting is how an original legend and bit of local folklore changed and expanded over time, either by happenstance or determined effort,  because it served a practical need.    Two distinct  events linked only by physical location yet bound inseparably by all those who still tell the story.  My whole main issue is this then: How many other stories, legend, myths and tales are there told today that may have gone through some similar metamorphosis in the past?   For any historical investigator who uses old folklore as a research tool, keeping this thought in mind may prove useful.

&amp;#x200B;

	I will close with two footnotes to ponder.   First, consider that the entire north shore of lake Eire was a major entry port for fleeing refugee slaves during the time of the Underground Railroad.  Sometimes when I talk to the  decedents of  mixed race families in our area I  encounter stories about the  difficult  issues these  relationships caused at the time, tales that are  not at all dissimilar from our original legend.   If we think of the preponderance of black settlers in this area and time frame, is there be another part of history waiting  to be discovered?

,newjersey,2019-08,2019-08-01 04:47:04,1,B,"&gt;The Morris County Board of Freeholders and Assemblyman Anthony Bucco have authorized an expanded street sweeping and storm drain inspection and cleaning project on county roads around Lake Hopatcong. This is part of a coordinated effort with towns to improve Lake Hopatcong’s health. Lake Hopatcong has been closed to swimming for more than a month because of a series of algae blooms. Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey Sierra Club, released the following statement:

&gt;“This is just a PR stunt to make it look like they’re doing something when they’ve been doing nothing. More street sweeping and storm drain inspects are too little too late. They should have been doing them all along. After all these years Assemblyman Bucco has been involved in Lake Hopatcong he has not done anything real to protect the lake. Now he’s issuing press releases about cleaning up streets. He should be pushing for a stormwater management plan for the lake, to bring back Septic Management Districts and expand stream buffers. We need more funding for restoration projects for wetlands and natural systems, and to retrofit stormwater systems in existing developments. We must also fix our aging infrastructure and reduce nutrients from failed septics, leaky sewers and combined sewer overflows.

&gt;“Lake Hopatcong has been closed to swimming for more than a month because of toxic algae. The algae can cause severe skin rashes and other illnesses. Recent tests showed the algae count increasing in many areas of Lake Hopatcong. We could reach a point where the lake itself collapses. Bucco’s issuing press releases about sweeping streets because he wants to sweep these problems under a rug. Lake Hopatcong’s crisis is a direct result of the state’s failure to properly protect our waterways. They have no watershed management programs. They have not addressed stormwater management and failed septics. They’ve done nothing with nutrient loads and Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) to limit pollutants. They have not controlled overdevelopment.

&gt;“Assemblyman Bucco bears some of the responsibility for Lake Hopatcong’s problems. He voted against the Highlands Act, and opposed Stormwater Management Utilities and C1 categorization of streams. He supported Christie-era rollbacks that got rid of the Septic Management Districts and weakened stormwater protections, rollbacks that still haven’t been reversed. He opposed dock fees that would provide money to help clean up lakes. Now he wants to clean up streets and storm drains. That’s not closing the barn door after the horse has escaped. The horse is 50 miles down the road. He attacks every program to help the environment, and then when something goes wrong and the public is an uproar, he pretends to do something. Bucco’s anti-government, anti-environment, anti-regulatory policies have helped create the pollution problems in Lake Hopatcong. A little cleanup now doesn’t accomplish anything.”",1

&gt;Climate change is likely to increase the frequency, intensity and duration of cyanobacterial blooms in many eutrophic lakes, reservoirs and estuaries197,198. Bloom-forming cyanobacteria produce a variety of neurotoxins, hepatotoxins and dermatoxins, which can be fatal to birds and mammals (including waterfowl, cattle and dogs) and threaten the use of waters for recreation, drinking water production, agricultural irrigation and fisheries198. Toxic cyanobacteria have caused major water quality problems, for example in Lake Taihu (China), Lake Erie (USA), Lake Okeechobee (USA), Lake Victoria (Africa) and the Baltic Sea198,199,200.

&gt;Climate change favours cyanobacterial blooms both directly and indirectly198. Many bloom-forming cyanobacteria can grow at relatively high temperatures201. Increased thermal stratification of lakes and reservoirs enables buoyant cyanobacteria to float upwards and form dense surface blooms, which gives them better access to light and hence a selective advantage over nonbuoyant phytoplankton organisms202,203. Protracted droughts during summer increase water residence times in reservoirs, rivers and estuaries, and these stagnant warm waters can provide ideal conditions for cyanobacterial bloom development204.

&gt;The capacity of the harmful cyanobacterial genus Microcystis to adapt to elevated CO2 levels was demonstrated in both laboratory and field experiments205. Microcystis spp. take up CO2 and HCO3− and accumulate inorganic carbon in carboxysomes, and strain competitiveness was found to depend on the concentration of inorganic carbon. As a result, climate change and increased CO2 levels are expected to affect the strain composition of cyanobacterial blooms205.",0

My friends and I used to swim a lot. In lake erie, at a camp ground, and 2 public pools in walking distance to us. We'd have chicken fights. That is where someone is on your shoulders and you work to keep them up while they work to knock the other person down. Close physical contact with your friends pretty much all summer long. In cleveland the stereotype that black people dont swim never held water.

So I said what I said about skin differences based on intimate experiences. Further, I'm gonna be 50 next month. I'm still friends with some of the people from my pre-teens and teens. While not 100% the general trend is that my black friends have aged better than many of my white friends. 

But I also know that my personal experiences do not count as evidence; thus I require input from others to have justified beliefs. You may have read hitch hikers guide. Do you recall the man who rules the universe? I am as noncommittal to reality as that guy. What I see suggests truths -vs- makes truths.

,magicTCG,2019-08,2019-08-21 02:27:06,1,B,"Question. How does pre-release foil plastic end up in the ocean? It's opened in the store (the vast majority of the time) and stores collect the garbage and that gets set to a landfill. They only way it gets into the ocean in that scenario is if someone is trucking ships to the ocean and dumping it, and then perhaps that's the issue we need to address.

&gt; but your last paragraph is pure speculation.

It's not though. Anything biodegradable is instantly out, because booster packs are kept for decades and need to remain sealed. Anything purely paper based is out, because paper wouldn't protect the cards (e.g. from humidity), never mind that the package itself would be ruined. Anything derived from petroleum would just be a shift from one type of pollutant to another. Any organic non-biodegradable plastic replacement would have the exact same issue re:the ocean plus additional ones from people confusing it with biodegradable. Any metal based solution would have at minimum the same issue re:disposal and would likely add additional ones depending on the metal used.

At the end of the day you can't have something that doesn't break down but also does break down. It's an oxymoron. On the supply side there doesn't exist materials that meets the requirements without having bigger impacts. This has been discussed many times before and many material scientists have weighed in.

&gt; If current trends don't change, in 2 or 3 decades the world's oceans 

Luckily trends did change in the last decade or so. The US stopped recycling plastic, which was performed horrendously. The US didn't process it domestically, it shipped all the plastic back to china and was sorted in China (along with other similar countries such as Indonesia). Some of that was from accidents with boats, shipping crates falling off etc and some of it was foreign countries that have poor enforcement of environmental standards not catching companies that decided to dispose of waste plastic by dumping it in seas and the ocean. 

[China is responsible for 30% of ocean plastic](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/world-s-oceans-clogged-by-millions-of-tons-of-plastic-trash/) and the next offenders are Indonesia, the Phillipines, Vietnam, Sri Lanka and Thailand.

These countries have recently raised the standard of living enough that it's no longer profitable to attempt to hire people to sort through garbage and so we've stopped shipping garbage to them and have disposed of it in environmentally regulated domestic landfills which has helped reduce a lot of that waste. Now we just have to figure out a way to get environmental regulations enforced internationally so every country can make the change that we already made. 

Planet Money has a good [two part series](https://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnByLm9yZy9yc3MvcG9kY2FzdC5waHA_aWQ9NTEwMjg5&amp;episode=NmI1NTM5ZDQtMDliMy00Mzg4LTg4NDMtM2M4ZjExZGVjYzkz) if you're interested in the history of landfill and recycling.",0
,magicTCG,2019-08,2019-08-21 02:35:53,1,B,"Actually the cardboard would be even worse if it ended up in a landfill. If plastic ends up in a landfill in a developed country (which magic is biased towards since it's so expensive) then it just sits there. It doesn't really decompose and anything that leeches out is caught and handled correctly (that's the point of the environmental regulations and why local dumps aren't a thing anymore).

Paper on the other hand does partially decompose. Normally that'd be fine as it's CO2 neutral, but in a landfill there isn't enough oxygen to break it down to CO2. Instead it breaks down into methane, and methane is far worse in terms of GHG effects.

&gt; that they would even live in an area that can accept that recycling.

Or that the area even recycles it. Plastic comes in all different types and is often contaminated with food or something else (like glue). It requires sorting it by hand and paying workers even minimum wage to do that would be insanely expensive (not to mention dangerous as it could contain something toxic of biologically unsafe).

What most nations used to do for recycling was fill those shipping containers back up with plastic and ship them back to the countries everything was imported from (e.g. China). There labour was cheaper and safety regulations were lower and it'd get sorted there. Recently these countries have started to actually respect their citizens slightly so they've stopped accepting plastic.

Most recycling programs continue to take plastic in the hopes that someday we'll figure out a way to recycle it and then we won't have to reteach everyone to recycle, but chances are very good that the plastic is just ending up in the landfill.

&gt;Climate change is likely to increase the frequency, intensity and duration of cyanobacterial blooms in many eutrophic lakes, reservoirs and estuaries197,198. Bloom-forming cyanobacteria produce a variety of neurotoxins, hepatotoxins and dermatoxins, which can be fatal to birds and mammals (including waterfowl, cattle and dogs) and threaten the use of waters for recreation, drinking water production, agricultural irrigation and fisheries198. Toxic cyanobacteria have caused major water quality problems, for example in Lake Taihu (China), Lake Erie (USA), Lake Okeechobee (USA), Lake Victoria (Africa) and the Baltic Sea198,199,200.

&gt;Climate change favours cyanobacterial blooms both directly and indirectly198. Many bloom-forming cyanobacteria can grow at relatively high temperatures201. Increased thermal stratification of lakes and reservoirs enables buoyant cyanobacteria to float upwards and form dense surface blooms, which gives them better access to light and hence a selective advantage over nonbuoyant phytoplankton organisms202,203. Protracted droughts during summer increase water residence times in reservoirs, rivers and estuaries, and these stagnant warm waters can provide ideal conditions for cyanobacterial bloom development204.

&gt;The capacity of the harmful cyanobacterial genus Microcystis to adapt to elevated CO2 levels was demonstrated in both laboratory and field experiments205. Microcystis spp. take up CO2 and HCO3− and accumulate inorganic carbon in carboxysomes, and strain competitiveness was found to depend on the concentration of inorganic carbon. As a result, climate change and increased CO2 levels are expected to affect the strain composition of cyanobacterial blooms205.",0

,wholesomebpt,2019-10,2019-10-12 21:44:34,1,D,"It would be very expensive and still bad for the environment.

The average PV solar panel has a lifecycle ghg emission of 46 g CO2/Kwh. Of course, michigan has much more atmosphere to dissipate radiation between it and the sun, so using the average would be very generous.

Next, the average industrial humidifier can produce 2.5 L of water per Kwh @ 80 F, and 60% Rel. Humidity. Flint, as of right now, is ~50 f and ~40% humidity, it would probably be about ~50% as efficient, but lets assume that Flint is optimal for solar panels and is nice and tropical.

This means for every 1 kg of water extracted, 18 grams of carbon are ""released"" by the solar panels (technically those emissions come from the resource gathering/production, etc.,  Hence the term life-cycle emissions).

The average american truck releases 160 g CO2/ton-mile hauled. It reduces down to 160 mg of carbon per kg(or liter)-mile of water hauled.

This means that a diesel truck can haul 1 kg of water 18/.16=110 miles and still have less emissions than an idealized solar powered dehumidifier in flint. That's enough range to haul water from lake Erie in Toledo, Ohio to Flint with less of an environmental impact than the solar option, even with all of the leeway I gave the water creation system.

TLDR:  Not even considering the financials, it would be worse for the environment than hauling water from out of state by truck.",0

You have a solid camera and lens combination. I just briefly looked up your location and it is quite light polluted, which perhaps is why you are having trouble seeing and photographing the Milky Way. BUT, there is hope! It looks like there are some slightly darker skies further East of Monteville. Furthermore, Lake Erie looks promising if you want to short due North. This can be useful for targets facing North as well as star trails.

This time of year, the Milky Way is setting due Southwest on the horizon. The problem with that is you will be shooting facing Cleveland, so the light pollution on the horizon is washing out the Milky Way setting in that approximate location. However, and I am not quite sure how you can do this, but if you take a ferry or something to get across lake Erie such that you can shoot with it in your foreground facing due SE/S/SW, you will be able to grab the Milky Way far more effectively. This is because rather than light pollution in your direction of shooting, you will have a nice dark, unpopulated area for the stars to shine. The lake would also make for some awesome reflections compositionally.

Photopills is a great app, but it can be a little confusing at first. [Here](https://www.photopills.com/videos/how-find-and-plan-milky-way) is a comprehensive, but great video on how to use app to find the Milky Way. Be sure to use the NPF rule to calculate your shutter speed! 

Also keep note of the moon phase. This coming weekend the moon will be illuminated to the point where the Milky Way will be washed out. You are better off waiting until next weekend when the phase is more ideal. I hope this helps!",0

,politics,2019-10,2019-10-26 03:09:12,1,B,"I’m on the east coast of Florida in Indian River County, the red tide on the west coast made it to me last fall, basically around and up the coast from the Gulf. I’ve been very involved in several organizations addressing water issues in my area. Working with local politicians, organizing, and educating. So I’m happy to rant a little bit about them. 

Algae Blooms are happening all over the world at a rate hitherto unseen. Rising temperatures and climate change are exacerbating them and we as modern peoples are woefully unprepared for their impacts. 

Potable water sources all over are imperiled and strained by them. An example is [in Lake Erie and water taken from there. ](https://www.wxyz.com/news/giant-algae-bloom-returns-to-lake-erie-threatens-drinking-water). Most water treatment plants do not currently treat water for certain bacteria caused by the blooms. Cyanobacteria is an example of this. Getting it out of drinking water requires specialized treatment which many plants do not use as they’ve never needed it before. This is expanded on in a very scary but interesting documentary called [The Toxic Puzzle.](https://www.toxicpuzzle.com/)

One of the biggest causes of the blooms is nutrient pollution (especially nitrogen and prosperous) and the best way to stop them is to stop nutrient pollution. Easier said then done though. Pretty much just our living our 21st century lives causes nutrient pollution. In Florida our population grows by about 900 people per day. We’re reaching the tipping point in many of our waterways. (As an aside, add in the archaic Florida water permitting laws and republican crony stacked water management districts and we have huge problems.) 

Money is the biggest thing stopping us from addressing real issues. Florida has over 2 million septic tanks. Any built before 1983 can be within 6 inches of the water table. (They added stricter regulations in 83, but older systems were grandfathered in and many pre-1983 septics are still in use today. [source from Indian River County. ](http://www.ircutilities.com/S2S/Presentation.pdf) 

So we are literally pooping into the water. How do we know? One way is Sucralose, lose, an artificial sweetener that cannot be broken down by the body or any treatment process for that matter. [source](http://www.fau.edu/newsdesk/articles/septic-system-study.php). It is an ingredient in diet sodas and the like. No way that could be in the water unless someone is dumping Diet Coke or the septic tanks are a leaking. 

That doesn’t even take into account into the bacterial like enteric bacteria which is found in waste. This caused the closure of beaches this year and last year here... And they only test three spots in the whole county... once a week. [Source. ](https://www.tcpalm.com/story/news/local/indian-river-lagoon/health/2019/08/16/bacteria-warning-indian-river-lagoon-sebastian-inlet-state-park/2028210001/)

Not really great for our tourism.  

At this point I try to stay away from the water personally because of the various health threats. A guy was killed here a few years ago from a flesh eating bacteria that he got from fishing. Others have also died. [source. ](https://www.tcpalm.com/story/news/local/indian-river-lagoon/health/2017/01/06/vibrio-vulnificus-indian-river-lagoon-bacteria/96166924/)

But I wish septics were the only problem. They are not. Other issues are fertilizers which are basically nitrogen. So add them to your non-native yard, it rains like it does in tropical Florida and it washes a bunch of nitrogen and phosphorus into our waterways, furthering the blooms and bad things in the water. Thankfully many cities and counties around here have banned application of fertilizer in the summer rainy season. But golf courses and Ag are exempted. And of course they are some of the biggest polluters. Add in that many local big box stores don’t care about local regulations and thus they still sell fertilizer even when it is illegal to apply it. [source. ](http://ircstormwater.com/fertilizer.htm)

Yet another contributor is stormwater runoff. As you probably know, Florida is pretty flat. It used to be a swamp for the most part. I live in what was once part of Mosquito County [(old map) ](https://www.floridamemory.com/blog/2018/12/21/a-county-called-mosquito/)because they had a lot of swampy standing water. In the middle of the 20th Century, as people were discovering how lovely the weather is in Florida, the state and local municipalities undertook one of the most ambitious engineering projects of the time, draining the swamps and straightening the rivers and making more land for people and farms. These canals still exist today and are maintained rigorously to avoid flooding. This basically flushes all the rain water to our lagoon and oceans. Untreated. So we also get septic pollution washing out from houses away from the waterways and also trash and plant waste (branches, grass clippings, etc.) in our waters. Some parking lots drain directly to the lagoon or ocean with no treatment. There are several stormwater parks in our area which treat the water in a natural way, as it passes through. Nature set itself up to clean out a certain amount of nitrogen from water as it goes by, trees use it (like our beautiful Mangroves) but there is too much now. [Source, but I said a lot here and it may not all be covered here. ](http://ircstormwater.com/)

This does not take into account the damage the freshwater does to the Indian River Lagoon, which is brackish (a mix of fresh and salt water) and messes with the ecosystems in the water. 

A further complication is “sewage sludge.” The right wing PC word for this is Biosolids. Biosolids are the de-watered sewage by-product of wastewater (sewage) treatment plants. Despite the name, biosolids are predominantly water, typically containing only 20% solids. Because they are biologically active, nutrient-rich, and contain chemical compounds as well as toxic metals, disposal of biosolids onto open land is a major threat to our waters. Land application of these were banned in South Florida, so they moved up north and farmers were applying “free” fertilizer to their farms with sewage sludge from south Florida. My county has put a 6 month moratorium on these, but can not ban them completely due to state law. This led to a terrible bloom in Blue Cypress Lake last year. [source](https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-blue-cypress-lake-tragedy-20180720-story.html)

So back to money, just replacing all the septics in my county (all 30k of them) would cost the taxpayers an estimated $500 Million. I can not find a source for this but I heard the number from the IRC Director of Utilities at a meeting last week. One of the previous links provided the way they are doing it now, by fixing the biggest problems first, and could be done in a few hundred years at their current rate. 

Another way money is a big problem is that special interests buy a lot of influence. And the state legislature is doing pretty much nothing to stop it. [example. ](https://www.miamiherald.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/carl-hiaasen/article236586568.html) [another example. ](https://www.tampabay.com/news/environment/2019/10/24/new-florida-wildlife-corridor-expedition-aims-to-show-what-new-toll-roads-would-destroy/)

A few years ago there was a big victory for environmental groups, we had a citizen amendment called Florida Water and Land Conservation Initiative, Amendment 1 (2014). [Amendment info.](https://ballotpedia.org/Florida_Water_and_Land_Conservation_Initiative,_Amendment_1_(2014)). The legislature did not like this and did not abide with (at least) the spirit of the law. [source. ](https://news.wjct.org/post/court-backs-florida-lawmakers-conservation-fight) The money was supposed to buy and conserve land but has been used for other purposes. My favorite was to pay FDEP Tech Support salaries. Basically they took the money And used it for things that weren’t proper uses so they could get away without cutting other programs or raising taxes. 

All of this said, this may be more than you asked for but it really pisses me off how pretty little people care about their water. Water is everything, and giving crops or livestock polluted water can cause them to also be polluted. [source. ](https://www.onegreenplanet.org/environment/shocking-facts-on-how-factory-farms-cause-water-pollution/)

And I didn’t even get into things like [Glyphosate (Round Up)](https://usrtk.org/pesticides/glyphosate-health-concerns/) or when [there are sewer spills into the water. ](http://veronews.com/2018/07/26/city-aerating-bethel-creek-part-cleanup-effort-sewage-spill/)

A similar wreck, involving a wooden vessel, occurred in June 1923. The craft, previously a World War I submarine patrol boat called the Sunbeam, had been returned to its owner, a New Yorker, after the war ended. The owner sold the boat to a new owner, and the boat was taken west on the Erie Canal, to be docked at a port in Lake Erie. The crew made a navigation mistake and found themselves well into the Niagara River, though still several miles upstream from the falls. They retired for the night in a nearby hotel. During the night, the unmanned boat came loose from its moorings.

The current carried the craft to the vicinity of the scow, and it likewise became caught in the shoals. The owners sold the wreck to Red Hill for a nominal sum, but Hill decided that the salvage cost was too high, so the boat remained marooned and by the late 1930s had broken apart.

The water levels I saw on Lake Erie this year were intense. A beach that used to be about 20 meters from the shore of the water to where the line of the beach starts had been completely submerged by water.

Manure transport across state lines is regulated by USDA and the various applicable state agencies, often the transport is fairly local as the cost to move it long distances is too high to be feasible. 

Another major issue is the lack of riparian buffer on the channelized streams and ditches. A wide vegetated buffer combined with a stream or waterway that meanders provides much more opportunity for the nutrients to be recycled. That’s why we are seeing localized issues (see Grand Lake St. Marys) and large scale (Lake Erie). Fortunately studies are showing that the BMPs are more cost effective than the inverse.",0

It creates a cascading situation - first you get hit by one wave that maybe doesn’t seem so bad because there’s only an inch or two of water in the boat, but then when the next wave hits you’re already an inch or two lower so even more water comes in in the next one. Even if you never get hit by a second wave, the weight and inertia of the water inside makes the boat very unstable and makes it much harder to gain speed, steer, go straight, and stop. 

I really appreciate that you’re asking for advice instead of just taking your chances. The main factors in most paddling deaths are inexperience and inappropriate preparation for conditions. If you want to get out on the ocean, get the right kind of boat, and don’t forget to always wear your PFD. 

Any boat that can take a skirt can be reasonably safe for light ocean use, although shorter boats are going to have handling issues. A spray skirt will keep water out even if a large wave crashes over you, although you’d still be in danger if you capsized and didn’t know how to roll upright. I take my whitewater boats out on the ocean or just Lake Erie in big waves from time to time, but I got a touring boat for serious open water. They’re a lot more than $149 but used ones can be fairly affordable, often under $500 if you’re willing to deal with an older unit.

Do you know when states rights entered the common discussion?  When the south was trying to whitewash everything in the era of civil rights.  You know what the civil war was about before that?

,cats,2018-08,2018-08-26 15:57:27,1,D,When an invasive species such as the round goby in Lake Erie is caught by an angler. The angler is obligated to extinguish that animal.

The Lake Erie algae bloom has been happening for mostly the same reasons, a massive amount of fertilizers from farming operations slowly leaking into the watershed and the natural ecosystems wiped out in favor of growing singular monocrops. Rick Scott just happens to banking off one of Florida's big cash crop industries (sugar instead of corn or wheat). All that sugar getting grown down there is just taking away the natural buffer that would help protect the watershed from this kind of stuff. One of the big similarities between the two algae blooms is that both areas that have been heavily affected both used to be these huge chunks of swamp/marsh wetland areas.",0

,offbeat,2018-08,2018-08-29 14:00:53,1,B,"Festivals aside, I have been aware that my kids (now in their 30's) were far less careful than my generation with ""stuff"". I suppose because my parents grew up during the depression and had to take care of what they had because it wouldn't be replaced, they were very hard on me to do so as well. There were very few things considered truly disposable. My friends were much the same even if their folks weren't quite as strict as mine. We used things up. Buying even a cheap tent to leave behind somewhere would be unthinkable. We would pack it away for that future date when we or someone we knew might have a use for it - even just a kid ""camping"" in the back yard. But I failed to impress this value on to my kids when they were still at home somehow. They preferred to buy cheap new stuff over having free hand me downs. When they moved out, they griped about taking old furniture, for instance, where I had been thrilled to get anything that allowed me to spread my money further. I'm sure there are a few tents in the garage that were used once and forgotten and another tent bought for the next camping trip. Funny though, now that they are established, and raising families and have true money concerns, they are less wasteful.

I find it really strange that in this day of sooooo much concern for the environment, that this kind of carelessness is prevalent. My parents generation thought nothing of burning whatever crap they had to save on a trip to the dump, and had no idea that a lot of it might be toxic. But they reused jars and margarine containers. The 70's brought all kinds of pollution controls and changes - kids today gripe about smog but have no idea what cities were like in the 60's! We couldn't swim in Lake Erie back then because it was a cesspool or worse. Yet, there is just so much cheap, disposable crap out there. Appliances are only built to last about 4 or 5 years and then dumped. Ridiculous! They used to last 20-30! But people want the latest ""looks"" in their kitchens don't they? pfft.

If there are other incentives, or initiatives to help with our climate problems I'm all ears, but there's a pervasive attitude that because it costs money we should just do nothing at all and ignore the problem. Climate change is real, humanity to a large degree is responsible for it, we can't ignore it. What's worth more? The air we breath, the food we eat, or some ""tax"" money? We sacrifice our long term stability as a society for a short term gain in profits. Besides, it's never going to get better unless large corporations change. The idea that these problems are caused mostly by consumers is a myth. The plastic in the Pacific for example is largely made up of fishing nets, and pollution in lake Erie is caused by large companies dumping waste, plus large amounts of farm run off (also from the U.S). Companies make money, that's what they do and they do it at any cost. We have to give companies a reason to cut back on waste.

,preppers,2018-09,2018-09-10 14:25:32,1,D,"There are a few reasons for it that come to mind for me.

People do have a short memory about this sort of thing.  Which has always been the case.  There is also the factor of people saying ""it won't happen here"" or ""it won't happen again"".  

Those are just part of human nature though.  I don't think there is anything we can do to get rid of those factors.  

Honestly, I think one of the biggest problems with people's lack of preparedness is the ""culture of preparedness"".  I consider myself a prepper and even then a lot of what I see turns me off from it.

I keep my prepping fairly quiet, and I prep for very normal things.  Major storms, large scale power outages, etc etc.  My in laws had no idea I was a prepper until the summer of 2014 (a year after the wife and I got married) when Toledo (where they live) had a toxic algae bloom in Lake Erie and the water for the entire town was dangerous to even touch with your skin for several days and not safe to drink for over a week.

My wife of course knew I was a prepper and always thought I was a bit crazy about it.  She always thought if something happened you just run to the store and get what you need real fast.

We got a call at 8:45 am about the situation from her parents.  Her entire family (about 16 people) who lived in the city had run out to stores and bought what they could.  However it wasn't much.  

Many of her family members had gone to Ann Arbor, Cleveland and other ""nearby"" towns two and three hours away to get water and found shelves were empty.

The wife went to buy some water for them here in Columbus (about 3 hours from Toledo) and found that by the time she got to the store around 10am that they were sold out down here too.

The wife came home and had this look on her face like she hated that she had to admit that I was right about how fragile our modern infrastructure actually is.  

I loaded up the truck with 20 5 gallon bottles of water that I had in the basement  (Side note, carrying 800 pounds of water up stairs sucks) and we went trucking towards toledo.  

I called two of my buddies to ride up there and help me out with the water deliveries.  I told the wife it was because I wanted help lugging the water.  Really it was because I wanted help securing the water as I had a feeling people would be getting desperate.  We all three have our concealed carry permits.  But that day we all three open carried and made sure to bring a few extra magazines.  I also wore a vest under my shirt, which thankfully was not needed.

The truck was full when we left town, but with all that extra weight and interstate driving I had to get gas.  My two buddies got out of the truck while I did ""to stretch their legs"".  

While nobody got violent and tried to steal our water.  Four or five people did come up to us begging for the water.  Some offered to buy it most just begged for it.

After we finish dropping off the water at all of her family's various houses my father in law said something to the effect of ""I'm glad we called you and you were able to grab this water for us in Columbus"".

Then the wife told him that Columbus was sold out too and all this water was already sitting in our basement because I was a ""prepper"".

Their response was something to the affect of ""But he's a normal person."".  

Basically, they thought preppers were crazy people.  And I don't really blame people who think that.  Everytime you see or hear about preppers it always comes across as crazy.  People talking about Zombies, Aliens, Nuclear war, The complete collapse of our entire society resulting in a mad max movie, armed uprisings, WW3 etc etc.

They also talk about how you have to have your own private army and arsenal that could rival a small country and you need to be able to fight like you are a real life action hero.

Very rarely do you hear preppers talking about things like hurricanes, Earthquakes, tornadoes, blizzards, drought, water table contamination, layoffs, etc etc.

Even I, as a prepper get tired of people only talking about the crazy things (that yes, mostly could happen but aren't very likely) and ignoring the things that absolutely will happen.


TLDR;


When the city the In Laws live in had a water crisis and found out I was a prepper by me bringing them 20 5 gallon bottles of water they were surprised I was a prepper because ""I wasn't crazy"".  

Most people consider preppers to be crazy because more preppers talk about things like the complete collapse of society resulting in a mad max movie (which could happen but isn't very likely) instead of things like layoffs due to a bad economy or a hurricane (which absolutely will happen).

IMO many people don't prep because many preppers come off as crazy.",0

Over time, as human activity has increased, the blooms of both red tide and blue/green cyanobacteria have gotten worse both in severity and in length when they move inshore.  In fact, the longest offshore bloom in recorded history of red tide was ongoing until it moved inshore this year.  

It's true that that blooms start offshore, but the discharges create a perfect storm for them to move inshore and do their dirty work.  And by in-shore, I mean under 10 miles from shore, because i've personally see the discharge color break 8 miles out in my own boat.   [New research has shown that K. brevis feeds off way more sources, fertilizers included, then we previously thought.](https://www.sailorsforthesea.org/programs/ocean-watch/nutrients-feed-red-tide)

Do you think the same thing about the blue-green cyanobacteria?  Because there is even more evidence, from Lake Erie to Lake Okeechobee, that pollution is the main factor in bloom severity.  Yes, its a natural bacteria, but it would never get to this level naturally without all the food we give it.

,Libertarian,2018-09,2018-09-20 00:37:32,1,C,"&gt;  just because the decisions are going to be made locally, doesn't mean that the decisions will be better 

You're right, it doesn't mean the decisions will *necessarily* be better, but the decisions will at least be able to respond to the local needs. With state control, the decisions will likely just follow what's needed in NYC because that's where the voter base is, and all decisions are forced to fall in line with that. But Manhattan is worlds apart from South Bronx, let alone a small town along Lake Erie. I'm not saying local control is a panacea, and I doubt Larry is saying that either, I just think it would tend to yield better results as a whole.

I don't know if you've worked at a company larger than a few dozen people, but hopefully this parallel will resonate with you. If you've worked at a medium sized company, you may have noticed that upper management or corporate occasionally imposes sweeping standards on everyone. Maybe it works well for a third of the groups in the company or even two thirds, but almost invariably, certain groups become less efficient because those standards don't quite work for them. The firm I work for allows for localized control over certain things and those things work really well, but there are some burdensome office wide standards that don't make any sense to us (obviously they make sense to SOMEone at corporate) and we in the satellite office have to fight and claw just to get them to allow us to things the way we think it should be done (sometimes we literally have to ""hide"" things from them so we can do what's best for us). And very often, when we are allowed to do things our way, things get better (for us). Do we make better decisions for ourselves than corporate? It certainly appears that we do. Do we make the *right* decisions? Certainly not all the time. Can we make better decisions for corporate than corporate themselves? Probably not.

The basic logic is that even if the smartest, rightiest, and bestest people work in Albany (or DC), the local bodies will *always* understand their local problems and issues better than those people in Albany (starting with parents themselves, then the local schools, then the districts and so on), and actually understanding them inherently gives them an advantage. Even the smartest person in the world can't figure something out if they can't possibly know the issues for each region in the first place. It's a very basic libertarian understanding...the individual knows more about him/herself than the community can, the community knows more about itself than the state can, the state knows more about itself than the nation can. That's why power should be as localized as possible (down to the individual).

There is another aspect to it, but seeing as how I've written too much already, I'll keep it quick...it's that when the state controls education, you only have one model to evaluate. When you have a bunch of different regions in charge of themselves, you'll have a bunch of different models to evaluate. From multiple models, you are much more likely to figure out which are good models and which are bad models.

Yes, I like charter schools as well. But given the ""blueness"" of New York, I'm not sure if talking about charter schools will get a positive or negative reaction. Where I am in California, it seems like when someone says the words ""charter school"", people hear ""I want rich people to kill kids for sport"".",0

,DebateEvolution,2018-09,2018-09-22 20:58:00,1,E,"The Human and Chimp Topoisomerase 2A proteins are practically identical.  Same for the ZNF136 protein which is in the family KRAB-SNF protein.

So the argument goes, since creatures like chimps and humans have virtually idenical genes, they must share a common ancestor, otherwise the similarity is by common design. 

But there is another angle to decide between common descent and common design, that is orphan proteins/genes or 
better yet taxonomically restrictred genes/proteins (TRGs).

KRAB-ZNF protein families appear only in Sarcopterygian fish and land animal Tetrapods.  KRAB-ZNFs sort of poofed onto the scene. 

So here we have a family of proteins that really share much similarity to any other set of creatures, they are
orphan to that group.  They don't have a common ancestor, and the probability of such a protein and SIMULTANEOUSLY 
The Chromatin remodelling targets and systems which KRAB-ZNFs interact with is astronomically improbable.


One could argue common descent, plus a few poofed in specially created proteins and the systems they are a part of, but then the irony would be Universal Common Ancestry needs miracles of special creation to rescue it.

FoxConn is going to be utilizing roughly 5% of the water that flows over Niagara Falls each day, and not returning ~2% of that water (the total, not of 5%). There's a strong chance that they're going to be contributing in a non-insignificant manner to contamination of the water, and also contributing substantially to the temperature of the water (which directly contributes in some ways to algal blooms).

I don't believe that there will be proper precautions in place for cooling, and so effectively we're going to see a non-trivial amount of water leaving the system, a large amount of heat energy entering the system, and the potential for industrial contaminants that are generally highly regulated. Generally speaking, these companies receive regulatory loopholes due to unforeseen weather related circumstances - meaning that e.g. during the Spring or periods of heavy rain, Foxconn may be legally allowed to dump amounts of completely raw waste into the watershed. 

The impact is certainly going to be much more minimal than if the factory were to e.g. be built in Cleveland, but unfortunately we're at the ass end of Lake Erie which leads to many of our beach related maladies.",1
,conspiracy,2018-09,2018-09-28 16:18:46,1,B,"Yes. In Ohio right now the ""algae bloom"" is a big issue on lake erie. A lot of the blame is being placed a farmer's feet. While huge factory farms MAY play a role in this the ones being punished by sanctions will end up being the smaller farmers. We're forced to take classes(that we have to pay for) to teach us how to ""safely"" spray our manure on our own fields. Factory farms can afford to do this, but it is a ridiculous waste of time and money off the farm for most of us. Thankfully, I am starting to see a slow shift to people wanting meat that has been ethically raised and humanely slaughtered, so those of us who can't afford to raise huge amounts of animals are starting to at least get a corner of the market back.",0

Then why are you only supposed to eat fish from Lake Erie four times a month?",1
,Buffalo,2018-09,2018-09-30 19:19:10,1,B,"For starters, there is no uniform limit on lake erie fish. You can eat more then 4 servings of numerous species. It heavily depends on the type of fish and where you caught it, as well as the age of the fish and whether or not you are pregnant, or are considering pregnancy. The 2018 NY state fishing regulations magazine has a chart available, although I can't find mine at the moment.

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, farm raised fish have plenty of toxins of their own. The same dietery restrictions generally exist for farmed fish as they would for lake erie fish. How much you should eat will depend on the type of fish, where it was farmed and other factors. The cheap tilapia you buy in the grocery store is fed the cheapest possible trash that keep the fish just barely healthy enough to make it to slaughter. In order to keep so many fish in such a small area alive, they are pumped full of antibiotics and the water is doused with regular pesticides.

&amp;#x200B;

Not to mention it tastes like crap. I'll have the delicious homegrown fish if I can get it.

,stormwater,2019-06,2019-06-02 05:34:25,1,B,"It's definitely an important part of designing any new developments right now. Most new subdivisions are going to have a pile of ditching and sewer running to wet/dry ponds. Some do it well, some seem more like they are just ticking off boxes on a list somewhere.

Infrastructure remediation is a major field. A lot of the older parts of cities like Toronto or Kingston have combined sewer systems where sewage and storm water are combined into one pipe. This can overload wastewater treatment plants during heavy rain falls and cause untreated overflows into the lake. These systems are generally being replaced but it's going to take a long time to completely separate them.

Agricultural runoff can create algae blooms which are terrible for lakes. This is a common issue for Lake Erie which is too shallow to really dilute the problem away. There are some provincial programs aiming to create a buffer of land between farms and watercourses to help contain the runoff before it reaches the water. Many cottage country municipalities have toughened up regulations around septic systems near lakes for similar reasons. 

The realignment and renaturalization of the mouth of the Don River in Toronto is an interesting project to help prevent storm flooding in the portlands and provide more green space in the harbour area. The ravines in Toronto have been protected from development since Hurricane Hazel hit in 1954 and killed 81 people in the floodplains of the rivers there. It's an example of a storm having wide ranging urban planning effects and led to the wonderful park system that is there today.

Salt runoff from winter road salting is an interesting problem here. Some creeks can get saltier than the ocean during the spring melt. Spring flooding is an annual issue that makes the news. It was pretty bad in the Ottawa area just in the last month and usually at least starts conversations about land use or watershed controls.

How precisely do you propose increasing the discharge rates from Lake Erie, Lake St. Clair, Lake Huron and Lake Michigan in order to lower their water levels?

Conversely, how precisely do you propose to decrease the discharge rates from Lake Erie, Lake St. Clair, Lake Huron and Lake Michigan during wet years in order to reduce the discharge of their waters into Lake Ontario?


And if your only solution is to draw Lake Ontario down by several meters by instituting massive discharges into the St. Lawrence River during normal or dry periods (While doing nothing about the inflows to the lake), how do you plan to protect the communities along the river from the inevitable flooding that would occur?


Additionally, such a plan would absolutely devastate local economies along Lake Ontario which depend heavily on lake based shipping, tourism, fishing, etc...

There demographics are certainly down due to over-commercialization and other direct/indirect human effects. Its kind of disheartening when our state legislature doesnt declare it 'in distress' when it clearly is. I'm not as nuanced with Lake Michigan, but i would imagine this would be even more profound in Chicago as its a more industrial and much larger city in general. There are no River otters anywhere close to the metropolitan cleveland area. They mainly stay in adjacent counties of Lake, Ashtabula, etc. Would you say this mimics your sightings?

Edit: As for adaptation, human introduced barriers are much more sudden then those nature presents. It would be difficult for them to adapt to the constant changes that humans present. Without realization of our interactions with the environment, animals wont have time to adapt. They will simply die off. I wouldnt expect to see open water versions you mention, for these reasons. The only change we will see is if we make conscious efforts to embolden them and extend their habitats. Not sure introducing, what would be, an apex predator like a large otter or seal would be particularly good for these Lakes as they have no natural predators there. Nature is tough to balance, we can only look to minimize our impacts on animals, both the positive and negative ones.",0

Of the big lake they called 'gitche gumee'
The lake, it is said, never gives up her dead
When the skies of November turn gloomy
With a load of iron ore twenty-six thousand tons more
Than the Edmund Fitzgerald weighed empty
That good ship and crew was a bone to be chewed
When the gales of November came early
The ship was the pride of the American side
Coming back from some mill in Wisconsin
As the big freighters go, it was bigger than most
With a crew and good captain well seasoned
Concluding some terms with a couple of steel firms
When they left fully loaded for Cleveland
And later that night when the ship's bell rang
Could it be the north wind they'd been feelin'?
The wind in the wires made a tattle-tale sound
And a wave broke over the railing
And every man knew, as the captain did too,
T'was the witch of November come stealin'
The dawn came late and the breakfast had to wait
When the gales of November came slashin'
When afternoon came it was freezin' rain
In the face of a hurricane west wind
When suppertime came, the old cook came on deck sayin'
Fellas, it's too rough to feed ya
At seven pm a main hatchway caved in, he said
Fellas, it's been good t'know ya
The captain wired in he had water comin' in
And the good ship and crew was in peril
And later that night when his lights went outta sight
Came the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald
Does any one know where the love of God goes
When the waves turn the minutes to hours?
The searches all say they'd have made Whitefish Bay
If they'd put fifteen more miles behind her
They might have split up or they might have capsized
They may have broke deep and took water
And all that remains is the faces and the names
Of the wives and the sons and the daughters
Lake Huron rolls, superior sings
In the rooms of her ice-water mansion
Old Michigan steams like a young man's dreams
The islands and bays are for sportsmen
And farther below Lake Ontario
Takes in what Lake Erie can send her
And the iron boats go as the mariners all know
With the gales of November remembered
In a musty old hall in Detroit they prayed,
In the maritime sailors' cathedral
The church bell chimed till it rang twenty-nine times
For each man on the Edmund Fitzgerald

Of the big lake they call 'gitche gumee'

All the heavy industry that surrounded it had been dumping fucktons of chemicals and contaminants  into it for decades and it became a polluted nightmare. Then, we realized that was terribly wrong, then we started instituting policies to stop it and now, it's not perfect, but it's WAY better. The solution there was stopping the polluting. 

Can we start talking about that a bit more? That maybe, using the oceans as national dumpsters isn't such a good idea?

And then, as is par for developing effective policy, we identify the mechanisms of action that are causing it to occur? 

Then we go a layer deeper and identify the actors that are participating in it occurring? 

Then we use the force of law to stop the behavior? 

I mean, this formula isn't magic.",2

A delta is not a natural feature and without a constant stream of sediments it erodes. If anything higher higher sea levels if the sediment load of the mississipi were still high would cause a velocity drop sooner and the land to form closer to population centers. 

I am saying that is like complaining about a rattling door when your car engine keeps stalling. 

This same thing occurred in lake Erie when houses put up sea walls to stop the erosion of their property. The lack of erosion there caused sand point at point pellee national park to basically disappear. That spit of land was within a few miles of Ohio at one point.

You just seem to be completely underestimsting how much 200 million tons of silt a year is. In the first 30 years after the lock system was created (1930) the delta lost 1700 square miles during a time when the earth was in a cooling period. 

Additionally, a major part of hurricane damage occurs because of the loss of the sand bars, and barrier islands that used to protect population centers from waves. You could literally convert the world to renewables, and cool the climate at the fastest pace on record; but within 100 years new Orleans will be an isolated island in the gulf of mexico (delta will have receeded).

Buffalo is doing their part to mitigate these overflows but shit flows down hill and we've got a host of metro  areas with similar systems upstream of us.

Yep, I could've abstained from posting the question but I saw those threads and they advise Zoar or beaches on Lake Erie which isn't what I was looking for. I like the suggestion above to check out the creek at Amherst State Park, and that lead me to find something similar with Sprague Brook so I got what I was looking for.

,collapse,2018-07,2018-07-18 21:41:16,1,B,"Cleveland, OH reporting in. Here are a few things I've noticed since I moved here 10 years ago:

* Serious decline in road infrastructure. Despite being caused by the extremes in weather we see up here, the local government's ability to stay on top of it seems to be getting noticeable worse.According to [an article from a couple of years ago ](https://www.cityclub.org/blog/2016/01/04/what-would-it-take-to-fix-cleveland-s-roads) they were spending only 3% of what it would take to fix the existing infrastructural problems. Anecdotally, I would say the situation has only worsened since then.

* Water quality concerns. Despite the utility companies assuring us that our water quality is fine and that there's nothing to worry about, the phosphorous-induced toxic algae blooms in Lake Erie returned in 2004 and [are an ongoing issue](https://amp.detroitnews.com/amp/779473002). For those of you who don't know, these are clusters or ""blooms"" of cyanobacteria that can produce dangerous toxins, and people living within half a mile of lakes with algae blooms are [2.3 times more likely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanobacteria#Health_risks) to develop ALS, or Lou Gehrig's Disease. Note to self: move up move out date.

* Financial struggles are increasing. As with most places in the U.S. [prices are increasing](https://www.bls.gov/regions/midwest/summary/blssummary_cleveland_oh.pdf); Cleveland however falls below the national average for wages and our unemployment rate is higher than average. It doesn't take an economics student to see that this discrepancy between wage-earning and price increase spells trouble ahead. The more I research this the more I see that Cleveland mirrors national trends relatively closely on most graphs, we're just doing so in a generally worse manner by most metrics. Anecdotally most of my coworkers and friends are struggling, a evidenced by many of them looking for side jobs, joining pyramid schemes and in launching their own businesses - most of them don't have a passion for business or new product mind you - the main reason is always ""I need extra sources of income"".

,Showerthoughts,2018-07,2018-07-20 01:29:12,1,D,"Huh, I wonder how

Edit: If anyone else is interested where they got their numbers

&gt; Uranium milling and mining can poison and kill hundreds of
&gt; birds per facility per year. Indeed, in early 2008 the Cotter Corporation
&gt; was fined $40,000 for the death of 40 geese and ducks at the
&gt; Cañon City Uranium Mill in Colorado. The birds apparently ingested
&gt; contaminated water at one of the settling ponds at the uranium
&gt; mine [1]. These deaths can be very roughly quantified into 0.006
&gt; deaths per GWh. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service [31] has also
&gt; noted that abandoned open pit uranium mines in Wyoming can
&gt; form pit lakes hazardous to wildlife. Uranium-bearing formations
&gt; are usually associated with strata containing high concentrations of
&gt; selenium. It is not uncommon for these pits to kill 300 birds per
&gt; year. Because those mines operated at about one-tenth the
&gt; efficiency of Canon City, they would correlate to about 0.45 deaths
&gt; per GWh. Taking the mean from both uranium mines gets us 0.228
&gt; fatalities per GWh.
&gt; Like fossil fueled power stations and wind farms, avian fauna
&gt; can also collide with nuclear power plants. Three thousand birds
&gt; died in two successive nights in 1982 from collisions with smokestacks
&gt; and cooling towers at Florida Power Corporation’s Crystal
&gt; River Generating Facility [1]. Given that the power plant now hosts
&gt; an 838 MW nuclear reactor, and presuming it operated with
&gt; a capacity factor of 90% and that the 3000 deaths were the only
&gt; ones throughout the year, the facility was responsible for 0.454
&gt; avian deaths per GWh. Ornithologists observed 274 fatal bird
&gt; collisions with an elevated cooling tower at the Limerick nuclear
&gt; power plant in Pennsylvania from 1979 to 1980 [32]. Since the
&gt; Limerick plant has a 1200 MW reactor, and also assuming it operated
&gt; at a 90% capacity factor, it was responsible for 0.261 deaths per
&gt; GWh. At the Susquehanna plant in eastern Pennsylvania, 1500 dead
&gt; birds were collected between 1978 and 1986 for an average of 187
&gt; fatalities per year [33]. Assuming that the 2200 MW plant operated
&gt; at 90% capacity factor, it was responsible for 0.01 deaths per GWh.
&gt; Extensive surveys for dead birds were also conducted at the
&gt; Davis-Bess nuclear plant near Lake Erie in Northern Ohio. Ornithologists
&gt;  recorded a total of 1554 bird fatalities or an average of 196 per year from 1972 to 1979 [33]. Given that the power plant
&gt; hosts an 873 MW reactor, and assuming it operated with a 90%
&gt; capacity factor, and the plant was responsible for 0.0285 fatalities
&gt; per GWh. Taking the mean for each of the four power plants results
&gt; in 0.188 deaths per GWh.
&gt; The total avian deaths per GWh for nuclear power plants are
&gt; therefore about 0.416

,askgaybros,2018-07,2018-07-29 02:24:12,1,B,"I am more worried about pollution than climate change. I think climate change has taken away from the importance and urgency of pollution.

Plastic is in a lot of water sources, like a shit ton, and it ends up in a lot of our food and drinking water. Micro particles of plastic are small enough that they don't get filtered by our water filtering systems and they don't get filtered by our kidneys and end up directly in our blood.

Then there is polluted food grown in China, and pesticide use virtually everywhere.

Lake Erie is totally fucked because of run off from pesticides; algae blooms. We should all be worried about our drinking water and how much plastic/ toxins we are consuming in our food/drinks.

But NOPE, everyone's worried about the earth heating up. It's like pollution stopped being a problem in the 1990's. We are toxifying our planet, who gives a shit about climate change when we are literally consuming poison right now.

Also no one knows what the effects are going to be from how much plastic we consume, we'll find out in a couple decades, could be benign, could cause lots of problems. Toxins are generally linked to cancer, and I think we're going to see a heavy rise in cancer in a couple decades after enough of it has accumulated in our bodies.

Another thing is nuclear waste, acid rain, and garbage dumps. This world is getting trashed and people forgot to even give a shit about that stuff because of some ice caps melting.

All bottled water and bottled beverages in plastic contain micro particles of plastic, all of them, they're very hard to filter and the ocean already has ridiculously high concentrations of it. This is all stuff that is proven and happening right now, it's not a ""what if"" like climate change. The climate fluctuates, plastic and toxins have never been so heavily in our diets until now, never.

NEXT TUESDAY’S ELECTION IN TOLEDO - Should Lake Erie Have Legal Rights? #Yes4LakeErie

Something unprecedented is happening in Toledo, Ohio. On February 26, voters there will be asked to approve the Lake Erie Bill of Rights (starts on page 4), a ballot initiative that would make it possible for citizens to sue those who pollute the lake for damages. The proposal is controversial, quite possibly unconstitutional, but passionately supported by environmental activists who are tired of watching state and federal officials stand by with their hands in the pockets while the Earth’s 11th largest lake slowly dies from man made pollution. In essence, the ballot question asks whether Lake Erie has the legal right “to exist, flourish, and naturally evolve.”

The City of Toledo depends on Lake Erie for its drinking water. In 2014, phosphorous pouring into the lake from nearby farms made the city’s drinking water unfit for human consumption for three long days in the middle of summer. According to the New York Times, “Stores closed. Hospitals accepted only the most seriously ill patients. Restaurants were empty. And some 500,000 people depended on bottled water in the middle of a brutally hot August.”

In recent years, Lake Erie has been covered in green algae that sickened swimmers and dogs. The slicks were large enough to see from space. Yet the ballot initiative is pitting members of the community against each other. Everyone agrees that farms near the lake are largely responsible for the phosphorous and other runoff from fertilizers that cause the algae blooms and undrinkable water. But much of the local economy depends on those same farmers for its existence, especially at a time when the automakers who used to employ tens of thousands of area residents have reduced their operations in an around Toledo dramatically.

Forcing People To Confront The Problem

Thomas Linzey is the executive director of the Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund, a nonprofit group based in Pennsylvania that helped write the Toledo ballot initiative. He says it has two objectives. One, to send a warning the community is fed up with a lack of state and federal action to protect Lake Erie. Two, to force the courts to recognize that ecosystems like the lake “possess independent rights to survive and be healthy.” He says, “There’s no precedent for any of this. It is almost a new consciousness — that a community is not just Homo sapiens.”

Actually, there is a tiny bit of legal justification on the side of the environmental activists, but it is a very slender reed indeed to build an argument around. In 1972, Supreme Court justice William O. Douglas, one of the most fearsome intellects to ever sit on the court, wrote a dissent in the case of Sierra Club v. Morton in which the majority rejected a claim that the natural world has legal rights.

Douglas disagreed, writing, “Contemporary public concern for protecting nature’s ecological equilibrium should lead to the conferral of standing upon environmental objects to sue for their own preservation.” Such willingness to “find” novel legal principles buried within the language of the Constitution is, of course, anathema to conservative judges spoon fed on the absurd theory of “originalism” that permeates many of the seminal cases decided by the Court this century.

A 15-Year Campaign

Linzey’s group began working with towns and cities to protect local natural resources 15 years ago. Since then the idea that nature has rights has won support in dozens of municipalities — from cities with long histories of environmental activism to unexpected places like Tamaqua, Pennsylvania in the heart of that state’s coal mining region. It became the first place in the nation to approve a rights-of-nature ordinance in 2006 after it banned companies from dumping dredged minerals and sewage sludge into open pit mines.

Four years later, Pittsburgh approved a rights-of-nature ordinance that prohibited fracking in city limits. Santa Monica, California, has since passed an ordinance that requires the city to “recognize the rights of people, natural communities and ecosystems to exist, regenerate and flourish.” Earlier this year, the White Earth Band of the Ojibwe tribe in Minnesota announced that it had granted wild rice its own legal rights, including “the right to pure water.”

Demonizing Farmers Is Not The Answer

The Toledo ballot initiative has created political fault lines in the community. Yvonne Lesicko, vice president for public policy for the Ohio Farm Bureau acknowledges that farms are the primary contributors to the algae blooms and pollution afflicting Lake Erie. But she also points out other sources of harmful runoff include lawns, septic systems, and golf courses.

Farmers are trying to limit fertilizer and pesticide use, she says, but changes may take up to 20 years to come to fruition. Can the lake wait that long? She suggests the ballot initiative is not a reasoned response to what is a very complex problem. “We care very much about the lake,” she says. “But this is not a solution. In fact, it is counterproductive. This is going to lead to lots of lawsuits and stress.”

City political leaders are conflicted about the ballot question. On one hand, Lake Erie is vital to what makes Toledo a place where people want to live. On the other, the city could be forced to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on legal fees to defend itself against legal challenges to the new policy if it is approved by voters.

“I think everybody is frustrated,” Nick Komives, a member of the Toldeo city council, tells the NY Times. He says he supports a clean lake but opposed the ballot initiative because it could drain city finances. “The initiative is a powerful tactic. And for me, coming from an activist background, it is important to send messages. But this is probably unconstitutional.”

Capitalism And Sustainability

There is an old, fairly crude expression that goes like this: “You don’t shit where you eat and you don’t eat where you shit.” This seems so obvious that it hardly bears repeating. Yet since the first colonists set foot in North America, the waterways have been used as little more than sewer pipes for carrying industrial, agricultural, and residential wastes to nearby rivers and lakes that carry them on to the oceans.

People may argue about whether human activity has contributed to a warming climate but there can be no debate that algae blooms and phosphorous contamination are caused by human activity. Where did the notion originate that people could treat the environment like a community toilet and never have to suffer the consequences?

Certainly the indigenous peoples knew better than to shit where they eat. What is it about colonizers that makes them think they can destroy the things that make life possible — clean air, clean water, and clean land — with impunity? If the native culture had prevailed, people and nature would have continued to live in harmony. Of course, their would be no interstate highways and SUVs, but the environment wouldn’t be contributing to shortened lifespans and sickness either.

An analogy could be drawn between putting a price on dumping harmful products into the environment and putting a price on the carbon dioxide that pours into the atmosphere as the result of human activity. Behavior that has no consequences rapidly becomes antisocial but can be curbed with appropriate pricing signals.

Yes, the Lake Erie ballot initiative in Toledo would forever change how the local community interacts with the land and the water, but why is that a cause for concern? Just because we have been dumping poisons into the lake for hundreds a year, does that give humanity a license to continue doing so in perpetuity? Is there not some point at which people wake up from their centuries old reverie and say, “We can’t continue to do this anymore?”

The Lake Erie ballot initiative may or may not pass. If it does, it may or may not survive legal challenges. But it is a sign that attitudes are changing and that caring for the environment is no longer something that appeals just to treehuggers and socialists.

Do you think that this sort of scenario is still a threat? And if so, what steps would you be willing to take to prevent it from happening again? Note that you shouldn't feel pressured to say it is still a threat, this happened a while ago and I would really just like to ask if you think the work done to prevent it from happening again so far has been enough.

If there is a benefit experienced from these drainage areas, it'd be of the nature described by Roger S Ulrich in his 1984 paper titled ""Aesthetic and Affective Response to Natural Environment"" where Ulrich talks about the aesthetic response to environmental settings as supporting positive emotional experiences both individually and socially. 

However, I don't think it's the same benefit as gained from isolated park experiences. The drainage system is surrounded by traffic and virtually inaccessible to individuals wishing to immerse themselves in a greenspace. 

""Greenspaces"" aren't necessarily green in colour, either. Here in Southern Ontario we have a place called Longpoint Provincial Park and while there is shrubbery and wetlands surrounding it, the *general* draw is the beach on Lake Erie. 

It's the experience gained from spending time at (in this case) the beach, both with others and alone, that constitute to this improved mental and emotional health. Being able to relax, to occupy yourself in the moment. To choose whether you'd like to be social, to spend time how you personally enjoy spending your time, and to do it on your schedule so that you can leave when you would like.

I am assuming you're in a nicely maintained unit, without peeling paint, crumbling plaster (covered in paint) or deteriorating wallpaper. When the paint-covered walls are in poor condition, people can inhale lead-paint dust and children tend to eat peeled lead paint chip, because lead tastes sweet. 

Your zip code has a lot of impoverished households that can't afford to live in a maintained apartment, and are living in a poorly-maintained slumlord apartment. There a lot of places with holes in the floor, ceiling, walls and peeling wallpaper that slumlords don't fix. Children living in apartments like these inhale and ingest more lead. It's a function of *condition* more so than age, even the more recently developed suburbs are full of pre-1980 homes that likely have lead paint, but these areas aren't hotbeds of slumlording and concentrated poverty. 

&amp;#x200B;

The third way kids ingest lead is through drinking. Throughout the *country* lead service lines were used through the early 1900s, and think of all the cities developed before then. Lead pipes (you can see this in the basement where the line enters the home, if you have them) get a coating, just like copper turns green. This coating prevents lead from dissolving into the water in it. In all the older US cities, the water engineers know about lead service pipes, and make sure the water they produce is the right pH to prevent that coating from dissolving, so the lead stays safely behind the coating. One reason Flint, MI was such a huge scandal is because they switched to a different water source and didn't treat it to make sure it had the right pH - for water engineers it's negligence, this is a basic consideration. In Buffalo, they plan for this and will never switch water sources from Lake Erie. You can also get your water tested by the Erie County health department (I think for free) if you want to be sure. If it is elevated, which also can come from crappy overseas fixtures being made with higher lead content, a national problem, then there are things you could get for your faucet before drinking - fixtures are a national problem.

Corporations should be able to do what they want, but also should probably have standards for workers, wages and environmental protection.  Nixon started the EPA because all the manufacturers were just polluting the shit out of everything.  See e.g.  Lake Erie, most major river systems in the Midwest.  

For every person that wants to invent the next cure for cancer, flying car, internet, there is another person working just as hard to figure out how they can profit off the work of others.

So, steps in the right direction would be (obviously these are just my opinions, and I am no way arguing that I’m correct):

1.  Almost all money out of elections.  No corporate donations, campaign funds capped, no pacs or superpacs or whatever else.   Federal elected officials in the US spend half their time in office fund raising.  No wonder nothing gets done.   Campaigns should be weeks long instead of years.  Election Day off. 

1a.  Citizens United needs to go away.  Corporations aren’t people enough to get money=political speech.  Especially when they then get the loudest speech. 

2.  Overhaul spending for defense contractors.  No more paying before work is even started, no more $1 trillion overages on contracts for a plane that is already obsolete.  No more $400 toilet seat unless it’s on a sub or plane and they don’t come any cheaper.  

2a.  To be fair there should also be an overhaul of the social security/Medicaid/Medicare stuff.  But I honestly have no idea how.  There probably needs to be some changes as to retirement age and that kind of thing.  And I don’t want AIG or Lehman Brothers in charge of it, we see how well that went.  Fraud and overspending are problems but I’m not sure how pervasive.  It seems like they arrest the doctors committing fraud sooner or later.  

3.  Criminal justice reform, nonviolent offenders shouldn’t be in prison for 30 years. Ain’t nobody want to pay for that.  Take some of the money saved and spend it on rehabilitation programs to train people to integrate back into society and better themselves.  And private prisons probably shouldn’t be in charge of that.  They aren’t going to zealously work toward having less “customers.”

4.  Either a robust single payer system or socialize medicine.  Something to actually drive the cost side of the equation down.  There’s no reason we should have the worst healthcare system in the first world when it’s also the most expensive.  Hospitals shouldn’t charge $8.00 for an aspirin or cotton ball.  The doctors should be the highest paid people in healthcare, not the executives.  No more drug ads, spend that money developing new drugs to charge a shitload for.  

5.  Carbon tax maybe?  I don’t know about this one, but something has to be done to incentivize moving away from fossil fuels.  Oil companies should have to invest a portion of their net profits into R&amp;D for renewables. (Why they aren’t anyway kind of boggles my mind, even spending 25% is like $4b/yr for Exxon.)  Not a fan of forcing this stuff but no one in power are really doing it on their own.  

Obviously these are all pipe dreams, like a perfect communist utopia or a perfect free market.  The problem is that big companies and governments get to a certain point where they aren’t accountable to the people they are supposed to be working for.  I don’t know how we fix that.

The Niagara Gorge, north from the falls to the mouth of Lake Ontario, is evidence of the falls slowly eroding its way south at a historical rate of about couple of inches per year (rates vary depending on the hardness and composition of the underlying bedrock).  The estimate is that the falls will continue retreating south -- somewhat slower now because water diversions for hydro power decrease the volume that goes over the falls, thus decreasing erosion -- eventually reaching the mouth of Lake Erie in about 100,000 years or so.  At that point, there won't be any falls anymore, just a very fast-moving flow out of Lake Erie into a very deep Niagara gorge.   ",0

How are those toxic Lake Erie algae blooms that poisoned multiple city water systems to the point of shutdown and required your governor to declare a state of emergency doing? Magically gone forever, I take it?

Jokes aside: the Great Lakes are in *dire* danger from a dozen different completely avoidable manmade threats, and shallow Lake Erie is the canary in that particular coal mine, but that has nothing to do with the poisoning of Flint. 

Flint happened because of Republican legislators who successfully raped our state's democratic process and left it for dead (a calculated four-stage process that many here can recount), then proceeded to spend the rest of the decade assaulting us with as much cronyism and perversion of stewardship as they could inject into the bloated corpse of our representation.",0

,BeAmazed,2019-01,2019-01-05 20:23:48,1,B,"Yes - or hopefully. One of the big issues in the Great Lakes right now is that Lake Erie specifically is highly eutrophic. The most recent largest algal bloom in history I believe was in ~~2014~~ [2013](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiTsaTNvNffAhUj4IMKHZ7cAnAQjRx6BAgBEAU&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fearth.esa.int%2Fweb%2Fearth-watching%2Fenvironmental-hazards%2Fcontent%2F-%2Farticle%2Falgal-blooms-in-lake-erie-north-america-&amp;psig=AOvVaw1PXOPMPH200wYYvqOontrE&amp;ust=1546806287245982). We've made great strides in reducing run-off and preventing further nutrient loading, but a huge issue is the legacy of previous phosphorous influxes. Phosphorous very rapidly precipitates into the sediment, where if conditions are good it will stay there unused. However, it can also act as a source to reintroduce phosphorous back into the water column and feed algal blooms if the benthos of the lake becomes anoxic. 

The question isn't so much ""can nature correct itself"" but ""*how long* will nature take to correct itself"". Given time an ecosystem may revert back to baseline levels, or may equilibrate to form an entirely different type of ecosystem, though it may not benefit us. As long as we continue to interact with and pollute water sources, the ecological state of the lake will remain unbalanced. 

To put into perspective the issues we deal with in environmental science and the time it takes to see the effects of positive change, let me give an example: 

Ground water contamination is becoming a larger issue. Pollutants from the surface percolate through the soil and bedrock into aquifers where the water is stored. If an aquifer has a 60 year residence time (the amount of time it takes for water to move into and out of the aquifer), then detection of pollutants in an aquifer are from pollutants spilled decades in the past. If we say ""we want to reduce pollutants in the aquifer to a safe level by reducing surface pollution by 50%"", we must keep in mind that there are 60 years worth of pollutants which went undetected that are still percolating and infiltrating the aquifer. We may not see any benefit of our work or reductions for decades. 

Environmental science can be woefully unsatisfying. Depending on your field, you may never see the benefit of your work. But thats why its so important to do - because the longer we hold off on addressing environmental concerns, the further into the future the problem will stretch. ",0
,Economics,2019-01,2019-01-05 20:54:51,1,D,"As far as working in the long run, since the clean water act was beefed up we haven’t had any rivers regularly catching fire, so that’s a major accomplishment.

I know that you certainly couldn’t swim in the river than runs through my region in the 70s and 80s, and you now can thanks to the TMDL plans and point source regulations implemented under the EPA’s decentralized structure. 

For people not knowing whether something is harming them and where that harm is coming from, they honestly often don’t. I don’t think it’s possible, nor something we would want, for every single person to be solely responsible for understanding how they are being impacted in every single way imaginable. That’s the beauty of things like academic expertise, investigative journalism and, well, informed inquiry and investigations in general. They allow experts in the field to dig into issues that would fly over a layman’s head to get to the root cause and the related impacts.

The impoundments were reconstructed and lined, and a pipeline was built to route effluent around the lake to recharge basins near the Prescott Airport. While this source no longer exists, it is expected that nutrients from this historic loading have accumulated in lake sediments. Additional sources of impairment include urban stormwater runoff influenced by fertilizer use, atmospheric deposition, domestic animal waste, streambank erosion, and other non-point nutrient sources. Existing wastewater related sources include septic leach fields, sanitary sewer system leaks, and package treatment plants. Historic dumping and landfills are also a concern""

&gt;Impaired waters are a subset of the assessments made where water quality samples for a particular parameter on a waterbody exceed water quality standards and the assessment methodology has determined that the waterbody is indeed impaired for the particular parameter. Impaired waters are grouped into two categories:

    Category 4 assessments are those that do not need a TMDL. These are not included in the 303(d) list.
    Category 5 assessments are those that require a TMDL or TMDL alternative. These Category 5 waters are assembled in a single document (the 303(d) list) and sent to EPA on April 1st of every even-numbered year, per 40 CFR 130.7. EPA must approve, disapprove, or partially approve each 303(d) list. 303(d) files can be found here.

I live less than a mile from the Great Lakes. Have lived here my whole life. 

The reality is, yes American companies have polluted heavily into the Great Lakes but so has Canada.

First off, it would be impossible for Canada to not have polluted.

Boating is a major thing in the Great Lakes. When my parents were growing up they would take a ferry to Crystal Beach, Canada. Major destination for both countries and it featured an amusement park.

Secondly, the US built the Erie Canal that ran from right into Lake Erie around Buffalo to the Manhattan River right above Albany. This cut major transportation costs around the board. Before this, the only way to get to NYC by boat was to take the St. Lawrence river from Lake Ontario or more upstream all the way towards Newfoundland and then thru the Atlantic to NYC.

Are you insinuating that Canada was ahead of the game and knew pollution was very bad and they were eco-friendly all the way before the Erie Canal in the 1840s? Because it was in the 60s, 70s, and 80s were people finally starting to wake up to the issues.

Let's also talk about how big of an impact the Erie Canal did, to stress that Canada would be missing out on a lot.

Feeding into Lake Erie in Buffalo is also the Buffalo River. The Buffalo River is lined with grain-elevators and it's only a mile upstream that you're in the lake. There's tons of them there, and there's plenty in Cleveland, etc. And if you Google it, there's plenty in Canada too.

At least 13 fires have been reported on the Cuyahoga River, the first occurring in 1868.[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuyahoga_River#cite_note-adler-15) The largest river fire in 1952 caused over $1 million in damage to boats, a bridge, and a riverfront office building

The Cuyahoga River, at times during the 20th century, was one of the most [polluted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_pollution) rivers in the United States. The [reach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reach_(geography)) from Akron to Cleveland was devoid of fish. A 1968 [Kent State University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_State_University) symposium described one section of the river:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;From 1,000 feet \[300 m\] below Lower Harvard Bridge to Newburgh and South Shore Railroad Bridge, the channel becomes wider and deeper and the level is controlled by Lake Erie. Downstream of the railroad bridge to the harbor, the depth is held constant by dredging, and the width is maintained by piling along both banks. **The surface is covered with the brown oily film observed upstream as far as the Southerly Plant effluent. In addition, large quantities of black heavy oil floating in slicks, sometimes several inches thick, are observed frequently. Debris and trash are commonly caught up in these slicks forming an unsightly floating mess. Anaerobic action is common as the dissolved oxygen is seldom above a fraction of a part per million. The discharge of cooling water increases the temperature by 10 to 15 °F \[5.6 to 8.3 °C\]. The velocity is negligible, and sludge accumulates on the bottom. Animal life does not exist.** Only the algae [*Oscillatoria*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscillatoria) grows along the piers above the water line. The color changes from gray-brown to rusty brown as the river proceeds downstream. Transparency is less than 0.5 feet \[0.15 m\] in this reach. **This entire reach is grossly polluted**.[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuyahoga_River#cite_note-14)

A lot of harmful contaminants are tasteless and odorless, so taste is not always a reliable way of gauging water safety. 

With algal toxins, it's complicated. Depends a lot on the type of algae that grow in a particular place because again, some are harmless. Warmer temperatures and lower water levels caused by climate change will likely increase the amount of algae in slow-moving bodies of water like lakes and reservoirs. Not really a quick and easy solution to this. However, nutrient pollution is one aspect that is often overlooked, and in terms of fast, cost-effective solutions, there is quite a bit of low hanging fruit. For example, Lake Erie (source of the 2014 Toledo outbreak) is severely polluted with agricultural runoff. Stream-bank restoration, improved fertilizer application practices, and (the unpopular) reduction in livestock farming are all guaranteed ways of  reducing nutrient pollution that feasible, under human control, and guaranteed to have positive results. But you don't see it happening because it all costs money and humans are notoriously bad at delayed gratification, especially when the gratification is ""diluted"" among many individuals.

,Ohio,2019-03,2019-03-11 20:25:23,1,B,"Large scale monocultural crops are:
- sprayed with fungicide, killing all biology in the soil, 

- sprayed with herbicide, killing some but not all “weeds” (and in the process, both killing neighboring not organic crops with drifting bad applications and creating “super weeds” - invasive species that are adapting and becoming immune to herbicides),

- creating so much stormwater runoff that basically all streams in the state of Ohio have seriously eroding banks and many are downcutting (stream morphology characteristics of streams that are unstable and actively changing because of current and recent impacts). This causes extreme amounts of sediment in water. The sediment itself kills and prevents reestablishment of fish, macroinvertebrates, mussels, etc that require cleaner water. The sediment also darkens water and this raises temperatures, which further kills and prevents reestablishment of sensitive native aquatic species, and this thus impacts all species that rely on those other species for food, shelter, etc.

- washes so much sediment off of fields that it causes all of the above ecological issues, compounding those issues.

- so much nutrient loads are washing off of gear fields that we have had toxic algal blooms on both Lake Erie and the Ohio River at the same time, causing Toledo and many smaller municipalities to be unable to get water from their water sources. Toledoans could not drink their water for a week. Or bathe in it. Or really, should not have, but probably did.

- the monocultural provide zero habitat value, minimal and bad food value to pollinators (birds, bees, moths, wasps, bats, etc) and these monocultures are not the diets they naturally would eat and often become sources of unhealthy food for pollinators. And because monocultures all bloom at the same time, food is only available in that area during a short window of time all year long, so it’s a terrible source of food and impacts pollinators in those ways.

- pollinators often will get sprayed or eat from flowering plants recently sprayed with herbicides that are often toxic to them, killing them.

- often monocultural crops are grown solely to be eaten by cattle or other livestock, which are also most often rested in situations that cause equally serious ecological damage, including tons of point source and non point source nutrient loading and pollution, stormwater runoff, and the reliance upon the entire row crop industry to feed it. The amount of CO2 and methane emissions, not only from farm equipment and cowfarts, but transportation of these animals and their dead animal parts also need to be taken into consideration.


Monocultural row crops are the centerpiece of a system of “food production”, which should also be called a system of governmentally accepted ecological genocide.

Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell says they’ll be nosing around your home and business, “forcing you to pay for costly updates.” New York Times columnist David Brooks cites the section on buildings as one way the Green New Deal (a “fantasy,” he calls it) would centralize “power in the hands of the Washington elite.” Scary!

&gt;The irony is that among climate policy wonks, the call to reduce building emissions is one of the more banal elements of the resolution. Anyone who has studied the problem of reducing US greenhouse gas emissions to net zero — “deep decarbonization,” in the lingo — knows that buildings are a top agenda item.

&gt;The reason is simple: Buildings are responsible for about 40 percent of the greenhouse gases in the US. Those emissions come, in part, from the fossil fuels (primarily natural gas these days but also heating oil) burned to heat (and cool) the water and space inside buildings.

&gt;That means the solution, alongside reducing and eliminating emissions from the electricity sector, is getting all those heating and cooling systems replaced by systems that are hooked up to the grid. In other words: electrification. (Electrify everything!) Happily for nervous conservatives, most of this work will be done by the private sector, guided by public regulation, so your home will not be invaded by jackbooted efficiency thugs.

The problem I have with this framing is that once the conservatives catch on that their current talking point isn't working, they're gonna pivot to the ""but muh private sector, but muh free market.""

Free market philosophy doesn't work without the implicit federal threat... ie exactly the ""jackbooted efficiency thugs"" you're making a throwaway joke about.

I seem to recall something about the lakes being full of untreated urban sewage.  I guess that's one of the problems in the historic rust-belt.  Most of the cities were developed prior to physical separations between storm- and sanitary- sewers.

Under ***climate change*** with high amounts of rain falling in short periods of time, 500-year events are happening on the regular.  There's no place to store that rain run-off, so they simply send the shit right into the lakes.  They are allowed to.

The last great lakes city that I lived in was discharging untreated shit into Lake Erie about 200 days a year.  Oopsy.  The engineering around the sewer pipes simply isn't correctly calibrated to the amount of rain the great lakes is getting under the new climate regime.

There are 151 towns just on the USA side of the border with combined sewage systems that are discharging into the lakes.

Part of the state and federal environmental agencies’ duties is to ensure the safety of the natural water bodies by reducing pollutant loading from point sources (sewage discharge) and non point sources (storm water or anything without a traceable origin).

The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) was devised by the EPA to reduce pollution loading to water bodies. The environmental agencies regularly monitor water bodies for the core water quality metrics to determine if they are impaired. These metrics include nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus, chlorophyll (algae), and bacterial concentrations to name a few. Once a waterbody is deemed impaired for a long enough period of time, a TMDL or total maximum daily load will be drafted. TMDLs mark a specific pollutant reduction goal to be met by the city, county, and/or state for that waterbody. Often this includes BMAPs or basin management action plans that highlight specific methods and practices that should be used to reduce pollutant loading.

If the routine monitoring caught high microbial concentrations for a coastal area they may have ordered a QMRA or quantitative microbial risk assessment to determine if the presence of bacteria such as E. coli are high enough to pose a public health risk. If the risk is great then they’ll shut down a beach.

Sorry if this is long winded, but it can be complicated even for me and I deal with this type of stuff on a regular basis. Let me know if you have more questions and I’ll do my best to answer them.

The CWA, however, did little to address phosphorus runoff from farms and lawns, known as “nonpoint"" sources. Researchers have shown that a rise in phosphorus levels—particularly a form of the nutrient that is readily available to promote algae growth—has coincided with renewed blooms in Lake Erie, and international agencies have called for a reduction in phosphorus to alleviate problematic blooms in Lake Erie and elsewhere in the Great Lakes. The largest bloom ever recorded on the lake occurred in 2011.

And lets not forget, the entire reason for this bill is to help protect Lake Erie, something Columbus doesn't benefit from at all. 

But one of the biggest reason why the state is going to put public money into all stadiums that ask for it, is because if a team is using a taxpayer funded stadium, the Modell Law applies to them and they can't just up and move.

I totally understand that people think their taxes aren't being spent correctly, but your anger is misplaced. 

If you want to get REALLY mad about the state wasting your money, look into Bill Lager, the ECOT scandal, and into private charter schools (Also dubbed Chartergate). We're not talking about $15 million, we're talking about $1 billion in taxpayer money that was taken over 15 years and completely wasted. They even used $600,000 of taxpayer money to payoff employees to stay quiet about the amount of fraud going on.

,worldnews,2018-12,2018-12-24 15:43:09,1,B,"There’s a sinister historical note in that old phrase “drain the swamp”. While it’s now a political phrase, it originated as a literal phrase, because that’s exactly what we would do everywhere we settled. Swamps, fens, bogs, marshes and all manner of wetland habitat were considered ‘junk land’ that would be better turned into farmland if possible. In the 1800’s, swamp airs were even thought to bring disease, which was utter superstition (swamps actually smell really good unless you dig into the muck, and are quite healthy to be near). And so we drained every last square inch possible.

I heavily sympathize with your everglades situation. there was a ton of swamp drained in southern Ontario - a very different kind of swamp, but wetland all the same. Drainage tiles were laid under virtually every farm field in southwestern ontario, and that area is virtually all farmland now, with areas like Chatham ballparking *less than 4% tree cover*. We took a landscape with lots of surface water and did away with it for human reasons. Southwest of Lake Erie in the states, there used to be a swamp *the size of a state*, now long gone and covered with farm fields. One of our largest and most impressive wetlands in my area of Ontario- the Minesing Wetland Complex - only exists because it was physically impossible to drain due to size and topography, and because of that it has some of our only 200+ year old trees. That’s what it took to keep us away - do the remaining everglades only remain for similar reasons?

In any case, we really do take a beating to the landscape, even with its human benefits. Fresh Water will be a *monumental* issue under climate change, and given how wetlands function to retain and filter water, we will probably wish we had more available.",0

We ended up putting around an abandoned marina called Turtle Cove? Turtle something? Well anyways we see a big plastic bag floating in the water and decide to go see what's in it. The wife grabbed a stick from the water and gives the bag a poke, but it moved very oddly. Like it's stuck, not floating. It eventually turns to the point where we can see a head under the water, along with legs and arms. I realized it was a naked girl, and her arms and legs had been hog tied behind her, and weighted by cement. The adults immediately called 911, police questioned us, then the adults me back ""home"" to the boat. It was kind of surreal tbh and I don't remember like.... Feeling too much if that makes sense.

What I really remember most is my parents talking a TON that year about how low the lake levels were. Barely any rain and the wind was always blowing it out. What they figure is that the killer thought the lake was a good place to dump bodies, but he must not have been from the area/not have been a boater or he would have been aware of the lake levels.

From what I remember, the body was one of two girls who had gone missing from a bar. I think it was a serial killer but I can't remember if he was caught. It was big news in town, but more than ten years ago for me. I remember the incident but not much else that followed. If this comment goes anywhere, I'll look up local articles about the murder and link back.",0

&gt;And, in terms of water quality, the critters are a reverse filter: They remove sediment and food particles out of the water, sapping the resources native mussels and fish need.

&gt;But they leave the dangerous elements in place. The invaders are picky and don't absorb toxic forms of algae known as microcystis, leaving it to collect in the harmful blue-green algae blooms that collect on the surface.

The intense loyalty can make people suspicious of outsiders because those people are just going to try to “make a quick buck” or use them (see housing market and loss of industry). Give it about 2 years and really REALLY try to put yourself out there and you will reap the benefits.

[This article](https://www.iucn.org/content/sturgeon-more-critically-endangered-any-other-group-species) also paints a fairly grim picture of their situation, but annoyingly that study has also only assessed 18 of the presumably 23 species which are thought to still be around. Are the other 5 known to be just fine? Why isn't that mentioned? I'm not getting a full picture/good overview. Let's see if I can compile one myself...

Subfamily Scaphirhynchinae:

* pallid sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus albus), Missouri &amp; Missisippi rivers, ENDANGERED
* shovelnose sturgeon, Scaphirhynchus platorynchus, Missouri &amp; Mississippi rivers, VULNERABLE, still commercially fished
* Alabama sturgeon, Scaphirhynchus suttkusi, only extant in ~130 miles of the lower Alabama river, CRITICALLY ENDANGERED
* Syr Darya sturgeon (Pseudoscaphirhynchus fedtschenkoi), Syr Darya river/previously the Aral Sea, CRITICALLY ENDANGERED AND LIKELY EXTINCT, no sightings since 1960
* dwarf sturgeon, little shovelnose sturgeon, or small Amu-dar shovelnose sturgeon (Pseudoscaphirhynchus hermanni); Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, CRITICALLY ENDANGERED, but knowledge is sparse
* Amu Darya sturgeon or false shovelnose sturgeon (Pseudoscaphirhynchus kaufmanni), same countries as the previous, CRITICALLY ENDANGERED

Subfamily Acipenserinae:

* kaluga (Huso dauricus), Amur river basin (Russian Far East/Northeast China), CRITICALLY ENDANGERED
* beluga or European sturgeon (Huso huso), Caspian and Black Seas, sometimes the Adriatic, CRITICALLY ENDANGERED
* Siberian sturgeon (Acipenser baerii), all major Siberian river basins, ENDANGERED
* Baikal sturgeon, Acipenser baerii baicalensis, subspecies of the previous, found in the Lake Baikal and the Selenga river, ENDANGERED
* shortnose sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum), eastern North America from Florida to New Brunswick, VULNERABLE
* Dabry's sturgeon (Acipenser dabryanus), Yangtze River Basin, CRITICALLY ENDANGERED, would likely be extinct if not for captive breeding (doesn't seem to be breeding in the wild)
* lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens), North America, LEAST CONCERN as a species, but rare in many places, e.g. the Lake Erie fishery has collapsed, and 19 out of 20 US states in its original range list it as threatened or endangered
* Russian sturgeon (Acipenser gueldenstaedtii), several countries, including Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, Russia, Kazakstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Iran, and the Caucasus countries and Caspian Sea in the middle of those, CRITICALLY ENDANGERED
* green sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris), Pacific Ocean/China, Russia, Canada, US, NEAR THREATENED
* Sakhalin sturgeon (Acipenser mikadoi), Japan and Russia, CRITICALLY ENDANGERED
* Adriatic sturgeon (Acipenser naccarii), Adriatic sea and neighbouring countries' large rivers, CRITICALLY ENDANGERED, possibly extinct/not spawning in the wild, but being bred in captivity.
* bastard sturgeon, fringebarbel sturgeon, ship sturgeon, spiny sturgeon, or thorn sturgeon (Acipenser nudiventris), formerly Black, Aral and Caspian seas, now maybe only the Ural river and possibly a couple of others, healthiest population is an introduced one in a lake in Kazakhstan, supposedly reproduces the best out of all sturgeons, CRITICALLY ENDANGERED
* Gulf sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus desotoi), 1/2 subspecies, Gulf of Mexico, VULNERABLE
* Atlantic sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus oxyrinchus), 2/2 subspecies, eastern North America from Florida to New Brunswick, [historically had also colonised the Baltic sea region](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2527320/) but now extinct there, NEAR THREATENED (same for the species as a whole)
* Persian sturgeon (Acipenser persicus), Caspian and Black seas, certain rivers, CRITICALLY ENDANGERED
* sterlet (Acipenser ruthenus), Black, Azov and Caspian sea, rivers in Siberia, VULNERABLE
* Japanese sturgeon, or Amur sturgeon (Acipenser schrenckii), Amur River basin, China and Russia, CRITICALLY ENDANGERED
* Chinese sturgeon (Acipenser sinensis), formerly China, Japan, and Korean peninsula, CRITICALLY ENDANGERED, many populations are extinct
* starry sturgeon (Acipenser stellatus), Black, Azov, Caspian and Aegean seas, extinct in the Aegaen and much of it's former river range, CRITICALLY ENDANGERED
* European sea sturgeon (Acipenser sturio), most coasts of Europe, CRITICALLY ENDANGERED
* White sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), Eastern Pacific from the Gulf of Alaska to possibly northern Baja California, LEAST CONCERN, despite being near exctinction in the early 1900s. Is one of a few species that are farmed.

Doing a save to count each status, although I definitely agree that your general assessment seems to have been correct...

The count is:

* Critically endangered 16, including 1-3 possibly extinct/extinct in the wild
* Endangered 3
* Vulnerable 4
* Near threatened 2
* Least concern 2

Just for the sake of nitpicking, YMMV if 70% (19/27) is a vast majority, but it's not unambiguously *not* a vast majority either, so I'm going to say yes in this case.

,Ohio,2019-04,2019-04-30 00:30:47,1,B,"The poverty wages are a part of the problem. Americans expect their food to be cheap, which requires poverty or slave wages. Europeans pay more for food, and their food isn’t raised with so many high-tech shortcuts like CAFOs. Americans would happily farm if it didn’t pay peanuts, but it’s cheap because immigrants or foreigners (for imported food) usually do the work, and most of all because the government gives huge subsidies to make staple crops cheap.

But conventionally-grown staple crops (corn, wheat, soy), animal feed, and the animals that eat them are ruining Americans’ health (antibiotic pesticides make the animals and humans fat—that’s how antibiotics work—now you know why we have an obesity problem—also diabetes and cardiovascular problems are out of control—and this can all be linked directly to poor gut health from the toxic chemicals and Frankenfood we eat). They’re also ruining our waterways and air just as much as the industrial pollution did 50 years ago. 

The food system supporting the American diet we’re eating is completely unsustainable with tons of externalized costs that are catching up to us in our medical bills and algae blooms. Big corporations are making bazillions of bucks off of poverty wages, taxpayer subsidies, and polluted waterways. The money is there to pay farmers better and treat the planet better, but it means these corporations will lose power.

So if you think we “can’t” change how we farm because of money—you’re absolutely right. And until the economics are changed and these big corporations are forced to pay for the damage they’re doing, we can’t really change anything. And the economics are all affected directly by the policies set at especially the federal level. There are ways to change the dynamics, but the politicians are happy to leave it alone since their campaigns are being supported by these corporations. And if they lose an election or retire from public office, these corporations are happy to employ them as lobbyists. 

It’s an insidious game where everyone thinks that changing the status quo would be too painful or scary. Consumers want to save money on buying food since they eat every day. Farmers like not having to deal with animals AND corn, they can now pick just one and it’s easy because all the chemicals and whatnot make it easier. Big corporations like making big bucks selling pesticides, seeds, food, and whatever else for whatever prices they choose because most are monopolies or monopsonies, and they have no real competition. The people who don’t like it are a small minority, or a huge amount of poor people who are too busy to care about politics.

And so we will continue to have toxic algae blooms in Lake Erie because people are less afraid of undrinkable water than they are of paying more for food.",0

The video is about Lake Erie, [The Lake Erie Bill of Rights](https://ballotpedia.org/Toledo,_Ohio,_Question_2,_%22Lake_Erie_Bill_of_Rights%22_Initiative_(February_2019)), and ""Rights of Nature"" in general. It is short and spends a good chunk of time on the specific environmental facts involved, but it does cover the general idea behind Rights of Nature as well. 

Rights of Nature, as covered in the video at least, are about granting specific natural areas rights and standing to sue over those rights. If similarities to Corporate Personhood and Citizens United pop into your head, well they mention those in the video (as well as Hobby Lobby). 

Rights of Nature sounds Blue coded to me (but that may just be because the video is from Vox), as is opposition to Citizens United. If this is or becomes a bigger blue issue, then we may soon have dueling ""personhoods"". One crowd shouts at another ""Corporations aren't people"" and the other replies ""Lakes aren't people"". 

As for the actual idea, I'm unsure. At first glance, I'm wary of just throwing around Rights. The more Rights of this sort we have the more they will end up treading on each other and the less useful they are. On the other hand, it does seem to be one way of solving the tragedy of the commons.

I’ve done a bit of environmental work in mining and a stream that gets constant pollution or a large rain event will usually look something like that. Depending on what kind of coal they are extracting from the mine would also tell you a lot. Bituminous coal which is a pretty common type of coal that is mined today is a dirty cheap coal. Usually contains sulphur and iron. Anyway after oxidation you get that pretty color. Perhaps a bit more dangerous though would be how high (if any) the lead concentration is. Which is why it’s pretty important to get a sample (an empty Gatorade bottle was always a field favorite) and get it over to your local public water management service. I’m sure the West Virginia department of environmental protection would like to hear about it if they haven’t already. 

Edit: I should’ve also mentioned the heavy metals will kill most if not all life in that stream and wherever it leads. And heavy metals leach into ground water. So any wells dug around there will eventually be polluted as well.

Have you ever lived on or visited a factory farm and talked to the farmers? 78% of cows that we eat come from them, so it's very relevant. I'm from rural Ohio, so I have, and my father's family raised cows.

Most of the time when a male calf is born, they very immediately pull it from the mother cow. Cows being social animals, this is incredibly distressing. To ensure the meat stays tender they want to avoid the cows getting testosterone, so they either cut the balls out with a scalpel or crush the spermatic cords with a clamp until they're crushed to nothing. Unlike humans, we don't give them painkillers after. It fucking hurts.

They then ranch it for 6 months to a year (separated from its mother, which is, may I repeat, about as distressing as pulling any given 4 year old away from theirs) as it's growing, and then send it (often for hundreds of miles) for the last 6 months of its life a CAFO (concentrated animal feeding operation.) Then they get hauled off to slaughter on a probably shorter journey. Animals legally must be rendered insensate before they are slaughtered, but, of course, this can fail. 

The problem with feeding them soy and corn is that this is an absurdly inefficient way to get your food. We have crises regarding water availability, widespread ecological damage from nitrogen and phosphorous (You can't drink out of lake erie sometimes because of fertilizer runoff in the cornfields that we use to feed the cows). 

The return on investment on the calories in the form of grain/corn/soy is between 1/5th and 1/20th depending on what you feed the cows, where the cows live, and the breed of the cows. It's a massive investment for a relatively low (and unhealthy, in the absurd quantities that average Americans eat meat) return on investment that causes a lot of ecological problems, because whatever's happening, we're not feeding those cows shit that was grown without using the fertilizers that cause algae blooms and damage the great lakes, US rivers, and estuaries.

They had well water. Of course working in programs like nerve agent (essentially pesticides) treatments, my mind went straight to some form of environmental contaminant. As a mother, since my child wants to go play in Winter's Run near our house, I want to make certain that we have clean water and air and our kids aren't being poisoned when they play in it. The Chesapeake Bay is critical not just as a jewel of the district, but it's also a large part of our economy. We have to restore the natural processes that clean the water. We also have these storms hitting our eastern shore causing significant damage, and chronic flooding will soon be if not already is a MAJOR issue in MD-01, so it is imperative that we address these things. On food systems, obviously you have similar concerns about what pesticides are being used, but in addition to environmental concerns, I get concerned about reductions in standards like those proposed in King's amendment to the Farm Bill (it was essentially the lowest common  denominator approach and undermining state regs like in the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act) and things like horse slaughter, because when we allow American horses, which are given medicines known to be toxic for humans to consume, and then they are shipped off to other countries for slaughter for human consumption, 1) we're poisoning other countries' food supplies, and 2) that meat is processed in the same plants as much of our beef, and we're finding horse DNA in our meat products. 

I know this is not laid out very clearly - it has been a long day and I will try to return and clear it up in the future.

I may not be an expert in all of these things but I definitely know who to call.

Re the TMDL requirements, this is not my area of expertise and I would phone an expert.

&gt; In order to accommodate sea planes, Cleveland's downtown airport was built on mostly clean fill dumped in the lake, meaning it was a combination of building and highway construction excavation from the period. Some dredging from the Cuyahoga River and Lake Erie was also used. A garbage dump occupied about 20 to 30 acres of the airport on the far northeast portion of the property until it closed in the late 1950s. The Ohio EPA found in 1987 that the dump area posed a ""low threat"" for land or surface water contamination and would not be considered for any ""remedial action"" list of properties that had hazardous materials problems.

&gt; ""The perception that Burke is built on a garbage dump and cannot be used for anything else is a public misperception that refuses to go away,"" says Ted Esborn, a Cleveland attorney who worked in the city's law and health department in the '80s and '90s. ""The EPA has never found this to be a superfund site, and to the extent they built the terminal and a high school on it, it is obvious you would be able to build other structures on it as well.""

&gt; Ohio EPA spokesman James Lee told Scene that the Ohio EPA ""is not aware of any additional sampling or studies at this property"" that would indicate any environmental issues from the landfill, and that the state agency ""is eager and available to work with the city, if assistance is needed.""

Yeah, the EPA story is complicated.  What you are saying sounds good in theory, but given the proposed EPA budget cuts, and the staff cuts already, there are probably a lot of companies ""risking it"" these days knowing there are a lot less investigators and so on.   So, some damage is already being done, but it could be turned around relatively quickly.

&gt;Swiftly, reforms in the “workforce reshaping” started in May 2017 when EPA began discarding staff by offering $25,000 buyouts to those at or near retirement age. Although 372 employees took the incentive, EPA did not replace them. All told, over 700 personnel have left EPA since Trump took office, and virtually no one has been hired to replenish their roles.

&gt;Worse, when EPA revealed to the Washington Examiner that it planned to reduce its’ staff by half by 2020, the plan was more breathtaking in its scope and ambition than most had previously imagined. 

&gt;Losing essential EPA staff means fewer inspectors checking smoke stacks for smog, scientists not sampling nitrogen and phosphorus in the Chesapeake Bay, technicians absent to analyze lead and copper in communities’ drinking water, biologists unable to monitor for aquatic life in Lake Erie’s oxygen-depleted dead zone. The environmental cops on the beat will soon be gone.

The blooms this year [have been incredibly promising](https://www.wm.edu/news/stories/2018/underwater-grasses-in-chesapeake-bay-continue-record-growth.php) and they are one of the largest factors in health since besides providing habitat, they hold in sediment to improve water clarity and produce oxygen to help combat dead zones, which combine to promote more underwater growth and sustain more life.

,evolution,2018-05,2018-05-26 06:37:30,1,D,"&gt; and it is not necessary for survival

Many things are not ""necessary"" for survival. That does not mean they are not *beneficial* for survival. Intelligence is unquestionably beneficial. 

&gt;  I am curious to know if you guys think high intelligence is dominant in nature or will eventually cause us to become extinct.

It is certainly possible, but if there is a way out of these issues, our intelligence is key to finding it. 

&gt; We can see that our life span is increasing and over population is becoming an issue, but at the same time we are slowly causing the earth to be unsustainable for life (obviously very slowly: deforestation, depleting of the ozone, etc).

Your question is the entire topic of Stephen Pinker's wonderful book [Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress](https://www.amazon.com/Enlightenment-Now-Science-Humanism-Progress-ebook/dp/B073TJBYTB/). He makes the very compelling case that most of the things we are worried about are either not really problems at all, or they have practical solutions if we just apply ourselves. This isn't just some baseless opinion, he actually makes his case with very strong evidence. 

For example, in the case of both of the examples you cite, we have already turned the corner on those problems. 

For deforestation:

&gt; Many of the improvements can be seen with the naked eye. Cities are less often shrouded in purple-brown haze, and London no longer has the fog—actually coal smoke—that was immortalized in Impressionist paintings, gothic novels, the Gershwin song, and the brand of raincoats. Urban waterways that had been left for dead—including Puget Sound, Chesapeake Bay, Boston Harbor, Lake Erie, and the Hudson, Potomac, Chicago, Charles, Seine, Rhine, and Thames rivers (the last described by Disraeli as “a Stygian pool reeking with ineffable and intolerable horrors”)—have been recolonized by fish, birds, marine mammals, and sometimes swimmers. Suburbanites are seeing wolves, foxes, bears, bobcats, badgers, deer, ospreys, wild turkeys, and bald eagles. As agriculture becomes more efficient (chapter 7 ), farmland returns to temperate forest, as any hiker knows who has stumbled upon a stone wall incongruously running through a New England woodland. Though tropical forests are still, alarmingly, being cut down, between the middle of the 20th century and the turn of the 21st the rate fell by two-thirds (figure 10-4 ).  Deforestation of the world’s largest tropical forest, the Amazon, peaked in 1995, and from 2004 to 2013 the rate fell by four-fifths. 

He doesn't seem to address ozone depletion in the book (at least it's not in the index, but I thought I remembered him talking about it), but it is generally considered one of the biggest successes in the history of environmentalism. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_depletion):

&gt; The ban came into effect in 1989. Ozone levels stabilized by the mid-1990s and began to recover in the 2000s. Recovery is projected to continue over the next century, and the ozone hole is expected to reach pre-1980 levels by around 2075.[4] The Montreal Protocol is considered the most successful international environmental agreement to date.

That is not to say that we aren't still facing real issues, but he makes the case that the only way we can address the real issues we face is by embracing our intelligence, and stopping the war on science that so many  people on both the right and left are engaged in. It really is an eye-opening book, and I cannot recommend it highly enough.

Edit: I'll add that if you are an audiobook fan, I really liked the audiobook of Enlightenment now. The Narrator does an excellent job, and made what was a fairly dense bit of information easier to digest. 

Edit 2: I just saw the book [Factfulness: Ten Reasons We're Wrong About the World - and Why Things Are Better Than You Think](https://www.amazon.com/Factfulness-Reasons-Wrong-Things-Better/dp/B07BFDCWZP) linked from Pinker's book. While I have not read it, from the reviews it seems to cover much of the same information as Pinker's book and might be easier to digest. I just bought the audio book, so I will try to remember to update this review after I finish it. First note, though, the narrator is not as good as Pinker's.

I probably should have linked [this](https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/a-park-for-the-people.htm) instead where it states, ""One of the first private organizations to call for a Cuyahoga Valley park was the Lake Erie Watershed Conservation Foundation. Executive Director George Watkins felt that if valley land development continued unchecked, soil erosion and flooding would worsen and wash more pollution down the Cuyahoga River into Lake Erie. Watkins began to work closely with another politically minded individual,John F. Seiberling, who had grown up near the valley at Stan Hywet Hall. Seiberling was then chairman of the Tri-County Regional Planning Commission and later a U.S. Congressman."" 

Earlier it also states this, ""Although regional parks safeguarded certain places, by the 1960s local citizens feared that urban sprawl would overwhelm the Cuyahoga Valley’s quiet beauty. Early efforts to slow development focused on fighting individual projects and rarely met with success. Active citizens joined forces with state and national government staff to explore options for a long-term solution. Eventually local leaders concluded that the valley should become a National Park Service (NPS) site"" 

So from my reading (please correct me if wrong), the idea to turn it into a national park was forming in the 60's though it didn't get National Park designation until later. It did, however, get national status as Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area (CVNRA) on December 27, 1974, as you alluded to.  John Seiberling was chairman of the Tri-County Commission between 1964-1970 per his [congressional bio](http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=S000230). It seems to me the river burning at the end of his commission term and the subsequent Clean Water act and Sieberling's election to congress contributed, but the idea was already there.",0

,environment,2018-06,2018-06-19 18:35:52,1,B,"&gt;Animal production has the potential to negatively affect surface water quality (from pathogens, phosphorus, ammonia, and organic matter); ground water quality (from nitrate); soil quality (from soluble salts, copper, arsenic, and zinc); and air quality (from odors, dust, pests, and aerial pathogens). Manure and other byproducts of animal production, if not carefully managed, will have a significant negative impact on the environment. Agricultural production has been identified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as the largest single contributor to water quality impairment for rivers and lakes.

Notice they say, ""agricultural production"" and not ""livestock production"". In case you're not familiar with the Ohio area, every year Lake Erie sees a runoff of fertilizer from the Miami watershed that absolutely kills the lake. Huge algal blooms and massive wildlife die off.

That is all due to crop cultivation. So crops are not free from these effects.

Here is another thing to consider, vast areas of the midwest are best suited for crowing corn. Most of that is fed to animals, which leads to inefficiency in energy usage, of course, but that is largely offset by the huge efficiency gain in growing corn to begin with. Essentially, growing food for human consumption would be unprofitable. 

And you mentioned crop rotation. Often, the best crops for rotation are animal feed such as grasses or alfalfa. This helps the farmer improve his yields and also feeds animals, with no detriment. It is very rarely the case that someone chooses either consumption crops or animal-feed. Both are often needed.

I'm just saying that the whole issue is incredibly complex. Nobody has it figured out. You can argue from a morality standpoint, that is fine, but I'm not buying the environmental argument. Perhaps the numbers can be argued. Maybe we do eat a bit too much meat as Americans, but to call for the wholesale abandonment of livestock is foolish in theory and in practice.",0

That is indeed an argument a marketist would make.  

Modern people are far freer to move to another city (while keeping the same job) than to quit their jobs.  But it is true that states are less easy to leave, and that moving to another country is legitimately onerous.

&gt; No.

Your source cites environmental abuses by a *totalitarian government* as typifying those of state activity.  That's a ludicrous straw man, whereas extreme pollution *does* typify unregulated heavy industry.

Owning the land makes no difference about whether or not it's polluted - industry pollutes land with impunity when allowed to, then just abandons it rather than paying the cost of cleanup (if permitted to), and the pollution leaches beyond their property into neighboring properties and municipal water tables.

People's children die of cancer from this shit and then they're offered calculated settlements that add up to a minuscule fraction of the profits the company made on the pollution.  **They kill people**, knowingly, and then throw a few coins at their families from their royal horses as they pass.

And they only do *that* much because of environmental laws.  If the government just completely got out of their way, open sewers of toxic waste would be flowing into playgrounds and the business in child-sized coffins would be booming (something marketists would call *job creation*).

&gt; If a private firm owned Lake Erie, for example, then anyone dumping garbage in the lake would be promptly sued in the courts

Except that company itself, which would use it for a dumping ground and sell the right to dump in it, and simply deny access to it for the general public so that they don't get sued for the resulting cancers.  But of course their pollution wouldn't *stay* in Lake Erie, so they would hurt people anyway, and get sued anyway, but the wealth of someone who owns Lake Erie would be so massive that people would have no real choice but to settle, as described above.

Midges look like mosquitoes but have larger thoraces (with stripes) and fluffy antennae (or some other protuberance by their heads), which apparently causes some people to call them “muffleheads” or—for some reason—“muckleheads.” 

Mayflies have long tails and are significantly longer, and are only around for a very brief period in the summer. They would not be confused for mosquitoes.

Adding to the confusion, “midge” also applies to a ton of other insects, including no-see-ums and other biting bugs, who are all part of the same general family. But the midges we get near Lake Erie don’t bite at all. The biggest impact is annoyance and that their poop can discolor surfaces.

,nature,2018-04,2018-04-04 05:41:09,1,B,"It took a few minutes to dig up, but as I suspected it's the *dying* algae that produces the methane, not the living ones.

https://eos.org/articles/algae-blooms-and-gas-wells-drive-lake-erie-methane-emissions

&gt; Kilogram for kilogram, the powerful greenhouse gas methane drives atmospheric heating about 34 times more strongly than carbon dioxide does. In Lake Erie, recurring algae blooms—like the one that left the city of Toledo without safe drinking water for 2 days in 2014—produce the bulk of the lake’s methane emissions, according to Townsend-Small.

&gt; The cause is algal decomposition. “After the algae die, they sink to the bottom, and the algae’s carbon is consumed through respiration by fish and other organisms using oxygen, so oxygen gets depleted,” she explained. The resulting oxygen-poor environment favors methane-producing microbes in the sediment at the lake’s bottom.

Algal blooms like this due to runoff are the cause of anoxic zones, they're just toxic to everything in so many ways. It's like an ecosystem version of cancer, of increased unregulated growth. 

The runoff gives the algae an almost unlimited food source so they grow to dominate the environment and take it over, there aren't enough animals to feed on it to slow or stop the growth. The algae expands to fill the limits of it's food source, which is pretty much the whole ecosystem, then it finally dies when it runs out of food. By the time it dies it's consumed all the oxygen, and as it rots it emits methane. 

Thus you have what was one a thriving ecosystem is now a nutrient and oxygen-free dead zone that not only emits methane but kills anything else that wanders into it.

https://www.statista.com/chart/12211/the-countries-polluting-the-oceans-the-most/

In the Los Angeles area alone, 10 metric tons of plastic fragments—like grocery bags, straws and soda bottles—are carried into the Pacific Ocean every day.

50 percent of the plastic usa uses, are used just once and thrown away.

usa currently recover only five percent of the plastics  produced.

The average American throws away approximately **185 pounds** of plastic per year.

Plastic accounts for around 10 percent of the total waste usa generates.

The production of plastic uses around eight percent of the world's oil production (bioplastics are not a good solution as they require food source crops).

Americans throw away 35 billion plastic water bottles every year (source: Brita)

Plastic in the ocean breaks down into such small segments that pieces of plastic from a one liter bottle could end up on every mile of beach throughout the world.



The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is located in the North Pacific Gyre off the coast of **California** and is the** largest ocean garbage site in the world**. This floating mass of plastic is twice the size of Texas, with plastic pieces outnumbering **sea life six to one**.



In samples collected in Lake Erie, 85 percent of the plastic particles were smaller than two-tenths of an inch, and much of that was microscopic. Researchers found 1,500 and 1.7 million of these particles per square mile.

Plastic chemicals can be absorbed by the body—93 percent of Americans age six or older test positive for BPA (a plastic chemical).

Some of these compounds found in plastic have been found to alter hormones or have other potential human health effects.

Statement:

&gt;News Releases from Region 05.Brownfields Program helps return blighted properties to productive reuse.

&gt; CHICAGO - U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has selected two communities in Ohio for Brownfields environmental Assessment, Revolving Loan Fund, and Cleanup grants.

&gt; The grants totaling $900,000 will provide communities with funding to assess, clean up and redevelop underutilized properties while protecting public health and the environment.

&gt; ""EPA's Brownfields Program expands the ability of communities to recycle vacant and abandoned properties for new, productive reuses, using existing infrastructure,"" said EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt.

&gt; ""These grants leverage other public and private investments, and improve local economies through property cleanup and redevelopment.""

&gt; ""Clearly there is no shortage of creativity, innovation and ingenuity when it comes to brownfields redevelopment projects in the great State of Ohio,"" said EPA Region 5 Administrator Cathy Stepp.

&gt; ""EPA looks forward to expanding our work with our partners to redevelop brownfields so they can once again be thriving parts of their communities - spurring local economies with jobs and new businesses as well as generating tax revenues and spending.""

&gt; Lockland: The Village of Lockland will receive a $300,000 Brownfield assessment grant to investigate potential contamination as a first step in the process of redeveloping abandoned properties.

&gt; The Village plans to bring new shopping options to Lockland's residents who currently lack a nearby grocery store or restaurant.

&gt; Properties to be investigated for potential soil and groundwater contamination include a former shingle factory and a bulk petroleum storage facility.

&gt; Toledo: The city of Toledo will use its $600,000 Brownfield grant to investigate potentially contaminated lands along Swan Creek, the Ottawa and Maumee Rivers, and the mouth of Lake Erie.

&gt; This is the city's 23rd Brownfield grant, previous grants have generated more than $50 million in property cleanups and redevelopment.

&gt; ""On behalf of the Village of Lockland we are both honored and very appreciative of the announcement that we have received the U.S. EPA Assessment Grant,"" said Village of Lockland Mayor Mark Mason Sr. ""This grant will certainly help us make great strides in the villages continuing economic development efforts in bringing in new businesses into the Village of Lockland.""

&gt; ""Toledo is fortunate to have a such a strong partnership with the U.S. EPA and much of Toledo's Brownfield Redevelopment success can be directly related to that relationship,"" Toledo Mayor Wade Kapszukiewicz said.

&gt; ""This $600,000 grant for environmental assessments is a great win for the people of Toledo. The U.S. EPA's Brownfield programs have played an integral role in the city's economic development and reclaiming land. Every area of our city has benefited from U.S. EPA assistance and we need more of these kinds of programs in the United States.""

&gt; ""This will be the 20th grant from U.S. EPA to the city of Toledo over the 20-year history of the Brownfield Program and that is an amazing testament to the partnership between the city and the federal agency,"" said Toledo Commissioner of Economic and Business Development Bill Burkett.

&gt; ""We are fortunate to have coalition partners like the Toledo-Lucas County Port Authority and the Lucas County Land Bank, who work with us to find solutions for redevelopment.""

I grew up in Summit County. My favorite place in our state, the Gorge Metro Park in Cuyahoga Falls, has a beautiful river, the Cuyahoga, running through it, and over the gorge.

Before the EPA was formed, NE Ohio's proud, wandering river was a dumping ground for corporations. Hundreds of tons of waste were dropped into our river. A study of the river concluded that ""life [does] not exist"" anywhere on it's banks or beneath it's waters. It was so polluted that the river itself caught on fire *almost 20 times*. The last fire, in 1969, was one of the major events that led to the formation of the federal EPA. It took a while, but life returned and our river healed, mostly.

Today, there are roughly 200 corporations permitted to dump waste into the Cuyahoga, despite the river being the main source of Akron's drinking water during the summers.

,politics,2018-04,2018-04-28 22:09:40,1,D,"You can always tell a completely useless article on this subject when it ignore the environmental issues.  The generation before the boomers WAS prosperous, but largely because it was willing to rape the environment to get there.  We used to strip mine and clear cut.  Lake Erie routinely caught on fire.  The air in LA was dark brown.

It was the boomers who A)stopped it and B) cleaned it up.  This made everything more expensive, as raw materials were obtained more sustainably and without harming the environment, and the cleanups cost trillions.

In the face of all of these extra costs, the public demanded living standards increase.  So freeways were made safer, cars were made safer (boomers grew up with no airbags, for example), products in general were made safer, and we still had huge demands to increase living standards.  Two cars instead of one, larger homes, etc.

So boomers did what they had to do to deal with those costs.  Mostly, they pushed them out.  Instead of the public paying for your university and making it back up in higher tax money, we made people borrow it and pay it back later.  They kept public salaries low by the promise of pensions, to be paid later.  Taxes were not raised to cover government spending, instead borrowing was used.

No one was going to accept that you couldn't pay for trillions of dollars of environmental costs and not have a higher standard of living.  So here we are.  It's getting harder and harder to push the costs out further, so you're starting to see strains in the system.",0

If it were converted to a stream again that sediment would flow downstream and a percent of it would go into the Chesapeake Bay. Virginia DEQ concurs with this in the current draft TMDL for Accotink Creek. On page 3-37 of the draft report it says:
 
“This 39% reduction from baseline conditions is lower than the reductions necessary for Long Branch and Upper Accotink Creek due to the 47% trapping efficiency of Lake Accotink that was discussed in Section 3.4.7. TMDL allocations in Chapter 4 are based on these assumptions.

Also, not knowing how long you have been working on the dam, how come they didn't follow the finding of the 1982 study and build a channel to channel the bulk of water and sediment downstream?

,nova,2018-02,2018-02-14 22:08:13,1,D,"&gt; When you say ""Lake Accotink Dam has significantly surpassed its useful life"" do you mean in reference to the material condition of the dam acting as a dam or because it was intended to create a reservoir for Ft Belvoir and no longer serves that purpose? 

Both are true, but I'm talking primarily about the first one. Infrastructure is built with a planned life cycle, but with tight budgets and competing interests, that often lapses until there's a catastrophic failure. Dams built in that era were usually planned to last around 40 years without major rehabilitation.

&gt; And when you say ""would be better financially, environmentally"" does that take into consideration that the lake removes 40ish percent of the sediment and even if they remove it the County would be on the hook to creat BMP or BMPs to match that just to be on par with the pollution removal that is currently ""baked into"" the draft TMDL? 

Yes, the alternative projects which would cover the additional reductions would probably be less expensive and more effective in creating biological uplift than dredging the current facility. Keep in mind that the calculated sediment reduction efficiency is reduced by larger rainfall events. With the weather regime in this area shifting towards sudden thunderstorms dropping much larger amounts of rain in a short period of time, we'll see a greater incidence of storms washing sediment out of the lake and likely reducing the sediment trapping efficiency. The impact of the sediment trapping is really more ""sediment delaying."" When we get hit with big storms, the sediment washes out.

Also, any additional reductions wouldn't be levied on Fairfax County alone. There are several other responsible entities which have land in the Accotink Creek Watershed. Granted, DEQ hasn't yet had to reallocate required reductions for TMDLs, so it's not currently known what they'll do. 

One larger facility with a similar situation is the [Conowingo Dam](https://www.chesapeakebay.net/issues/conowingo_dam). It's near the border between Maryland and Pennsylvania, so it doesn't tell us anything about DEQ, but it has important lessons about the efficacy of pollutant reduction by large dams.

&gt; Also, not knowing how long you have been working on the dam, how come they didn't follow the finding of the 1982 study and build a channel to channel the bulk of water and sediment downstream? 

I don't have an answer for that one, but I will speculate that it's a complicated problem since it's the same way today. People have conflicting ideas of how things should be, and making drastic changes in a landscape that's existed for 40 years(as of 1982) takes a lot of political willpower and dollars.

Glyphosate in Runoff Waters and in the Root-Zone: A Review - Nov 2015
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5606642/

&gt; 2 Environmental Fate

&gt; 2.1 Soil Interactions

&gt; Although glyphosate is typically sprayed onto plant foliage, some amount accumulates in the soil through by-spray or being washed off of plant surfaces during precipitation. Once in the soil, glyphosate tightly sorbs to soil particles and especially for soil oxides and hydroxides . This high affinity for soil particles limits glyphosate’s mobility in the environment, a property considered to be beneficial, since it makes glyphosate somewhat “environmentally benign”. Phosphate, present in fertilizers, competes with glyphosate for binding sites of soil micelles. Under most conditions, phosphate is preferentially sorbed, the presence of which may remobilize previously-bound glyphosate

ok, so there's that...

and..

&gt; Glyphosate in soil is degraded by microorganisms

too busy now to dig up studies on glyphosate's effects *on* soil microorganisms (right now), but /r/glyphosate .. I've posted some there..  point: it's broken down by them.. but reduces them too. Even then, per above paragraph, it still binds to the soil 'quite well'..


***

moving forward...

&gt; 2.2 Occurrence in Water

&gt; Although glyphosate has rarely been reported in groundwater, when detected, the concentrations are very low. One study conducted by the EPA over six years found glyphosate in seven groundwater samples out of 27,877 samples tested, with a maximum detected concentration of 1.1 µg·L−1 [79]. For comparison, the maximum contaminant limit (MCL) for glyphosate is 700 µg·L−1 [80].


goes on...

&gt; Glyphosate is conservatively estimated to have an aquatic half-life of 7–14 days in surface waters [4]. Glyphosate is considered to have low potential for runoff due to its high affinity for soils [12]. Contrary to this conventional wisdom, glyphosate has been detected in surface waters, generally within agricultural ditches near the site of application.

Glyphosate Loss by Runoff and Its Relationship with Phosphorus Fertilization - March 2015  (note, over a year before the above two stores)
https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jf505533r

**Abstract**

The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between glyphosate and phosphate fertilizer application and their contribution to surface water runoff contamination. The study was performed in Aquic Argiudoll soil (Tezanos Pinto series). Four treatments were assessed on three dates of rainfall simulation after fertilizer and herbicide application. The soluble phosphorus in runoff water was determined by a colorimetric method. For the determination of glyphosate and aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA), a method based on fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (FMOC) group derivatization, solid phase extraction (SPE) purification, and ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) was employed. **The application of phosphorus fertilizer resulted in an increased loss of glyphosate by runoff after 1 day of application.** These results suggest the need for further study to understand the interactions and to determine appropriate application timing with the goal of reducing the pollution risk by runoff.

Or rather, climate _is_ weather, just average weather over a period of time. So this arctic cold spell _is_ a part of the 'climate record'. However, simply stopping there and claiming it's evidence against global warming ignores (1) the overall trend is that US winters are getting warmer, and (2) climate change can also make these freeze events more likely as the weakened jet stream's winds in the arctic spill that polar vortex further South.

Extreme weather events are becoming more common and more intense. In fact, lakes no longer freezing over in winter cause more evaporation, which in turn can lead to larger snowfalls and worse winter storms. Lake Erie stopped freezing over in 2006, which produce larger lake-effect snows like the record one just recently in Erie, PA. If it was frozen, it wouldn't have occurred as it did.",0

After the excessive spread of harmful algal blooms in nearby western Lake Erie came back in 2011 and every year since then, there has been renewed interest in restoring wetlands in the drained Black Swamp area.

From my personnel (unlike many that are only outside walking from work to their cars), I can tell you that the climate IS changing. I live in the mid-west (Michigan) and have seen the summers get warmer and the winters get shorter with less snow. The crops and insects are affected by this as well as migration of birds and our great GREAT lakes….

Regardless of what ANYONE thinks, it would be ignorant to think the addition billions and billions of people, the pollution we produce coupled with the removal of our forests wouldn’t make any sort of impact….here in the Great Lake region, industries used to dump ALL their waste (toxic or not) into the lakes thinking that it would be safe because of their size (dilution was the solution for pollution back them)…well, some rivers literally caught on fire and eventually Lake Erie (by the late 60’s) was considered a ‘dead’ lake with no fish due to the pollution…multiply this fact over the entire world. Ecosystems are collapsing, the oceans are warming because of this (acidification killing plankton), which then snowballs out to other systems (ie WEATHER).

If you don’t believe that this ‘could’ or ‘is’ happening, then wouldn’t be SMART to produce clean energy and clean waste (ie, biodegrade plastics) for clean air? Clean water? Fertile soil?...Flint Michigan had a water crisis from drink lead tainted water from a river that people eat the fish from? Toxic waste dumps taint ground water, cars and factory emissions belch so much CO2 in the air that the Earth struggles to absorb it due to the declining forests and planktons….

Its simple math after all…climate change or not, it’s better to be clean than ‘right’.

An oil spill off the California coast in 1969 coated 400 square miles with slime and killed hundreds of birds. Scientists announced that auto exhaust was at high enough levels in some places that it could cause birth defects.

I am not very familiar with the all the details so if someone please correct me, but it looks like Nixon set up a council group in his cabinet and Congress set up what would become the EPA. (dems controlled Congress in 1969) 
&gt;  In the summer of 1969, Nixon established the Environmental Quality Council, which TIME described as “a Cabinet-level advisory group designed to coordinate governmental action against environmental decay at all levels, create new proposals to control pollution, and foresee problems.” Shortly after, Congress passed the Environmental Policy Act of 1969, one element of which was to create a Council on Environmental Policy, “empowered to review all federal activities that affect the quality of life and make reports directly to the President,” per the magazine.

EDIT: Im not a pot head dropout and i am actually in the 10th grade

EDIT: 3:48PM 

**Hey everyone I'm gonna write a somewhat extended response to what I see going on as a student inside ecot. I woke up this morning the news I've been expecting for a couple months now as i'm sure many other of you have. Im a little bit scared of the near future and how things are going to be handled over the next couple weeks or so. I have decided that if ECOT does end up closing down I'm going to start attending a traditional school again something I haven't done for 4 or 5 years.**

**Besides the photo above I just received this in my ECOT inbox.**

&gt;Good afternoon everyone,

&gt;Please see the information attached to this e mail regarding the announcement you saw about ECOT in the I Qity main announcements this morning or anything you have read in the newspaper, heard on the radio or have seen on TV.

&gt;Unfortunately we were not informed about these actions until last evening. As updates are provided to staff members I'll send you updates.

&gt;Mrs. (leaving name blank for privacy)

**It seems that the teachers are just about as in the know with whats going on inside ecot as the rest of us. Which seems really off considering the teachers are sort of the ones who are really running the show. I will say that the people we should be targeting are the politicians on the both ECOT and Government sides who have let this escalate to the point where it is.**

**Anyways, the email content a .pdf that stated the following:**

&gt;What does the recent announcement mean?

&gt;We have not been dropped by our sponsor. Suspension means that we temporarily have to stop educating students until issues of concern to the sponsor can be addressed. At this time, we are appealing the potential suspension.

**This sort of addresses the situation a bit more, but it seems like they are ignoring this suspension as I was able to access all of my classes today and complete assignments.**

&gt;When are you closing?

&gt;ECOT could suspend operations as early as the end of day January 19th but we have the ability to reopen through September 30, 2018 if that were to happen. At this time, we have no set date for suspension of operations due to the appeal in progress.

**This is pretty much confirming that it is entirely possible that ECOT could be done after this month. if we're waiting almost a year to be able to get back into school most students likely would have switched schools and had no intention in returning to ECOT.**

&gt;How can I get my records? 
&gt;If we were to close, records will be distributed to the board office of your local district of residence. A letter will be mailed to your address on file with the address, phone number and projected date for your ability to obtain your files from that office. If you are requesting records now, please have your homeroom teacher request a withdraw form to be sent. Note: ECOT is not working with any outside agency to assist in record access or delivery.

**If it does go downhill we will still get our grades and will be easily able to transition them to our next school. Standard stuff of course.**

&gt;Will I get my test scores?
&gt; If test scores are delivered to ECOT, they will be forwarded to the board office where your cumulative files were sent previously.

**Overall, its not 100% yet but this is looking to be the end of days for ECOT considering every single motion they have called on trial has been denied (by a matter of LAW vapes) So assuming that they follow the trend of constant denial by the state and board this is honestly it fellas.**",0

,climateskeptics,2018-01,2018-01-11 16:54:30,1,D,"The actual, or ""true"" sea levels are very very hard to determine reliably. Last Year's ""New Scientist"" had a big article about this, stating very clearly, that in European ports they'd vary by as much as 1/2 to 1 meter!!!!  The problems are quite clear and as have written about a number of times. Determining a few inches of sea level rise over time, is thus largely preposterous, too.

First, what is the solid, benchmark standard for determining sea level?  Answer?  There isn't ANY. The reasons for this are the tides, which can ebb and flow in a complex system manner because the moon and sun's alignments which determine tides are very complicated.

Next, there is NO sea level possible on an absolute scale. They are always relative and comparative, which means there is no absolute sea level possible.

Then, as a matter of fact the tides can be measured within a single tidal basin and embayment, but due to the changing heights of the tides, those will vary greatly. Storms and swells, esp. in winter can change the tides substantially as anyone who's been to Hawaii in the winters can see. The beach can be 20-30 above sea level and 15 minutes later, the waves can be lapping at the beach . We found this in many places in Kauai, where at the Westin the ocean depth about 50' out was shin height and about 10' later we'd be off the bottom paddling for shore because of the swells.  1 person had drowned the previous week due to those swells, right at that beach!!! That's quite frankly 3 m. of variation in sea level as well.

next, the embayment and harbour shapes CAN and DO affect the heights of the tides, as anyone in the Bay of Fundy knows. And wide bays where there are currents it also occurs.

And not last but surely importantly, the earth is a spinning oblate spheroid. Visualize this: oceans will and do bulge at the equator which is spinning a LOT faster, than say at 40 deg. N. latitude. And this means the oceans bulge much much more at the equator than they do at higher latitudes. So sea level varies according to this factor too.

Combining all of these variations, it means that sea level determination being a complex system, cannot have a simple, common, universal value at all.

Thus the problems of ""rising sea levels"" CANNOT even be determined within 1/2-1 m. accuracy in the European harbours, either, be it Atlantic or Mediterranean. The latter has in addition tidal seiches where the sea level will rock north to south, or east to west with the winds, as is often seen in the Great Lakes, as well. That greatly confounds sea level determinations as well.

So, frankly, sea level determinations are about as predictable as the  weather, are complex system and thus have NO absolute values, either, except being more local than anything and surely NOT universal.

Those are the known problems, and given the interaction of all of those complex system parts, anything more than a general probability is highly likely to be out of the question.

Thus, sea level determinations, which are also dependent upon rising shores when glacial ice has melted off, as affects Lake Erie (&amp; the UK), which is still rebounding from glacial ice, steadily, yearly rising in the northern shores and dumping more and more water onto the southern, Ohio shores, as well. That has meant that the I-90 road had to be diverted well inland, because it was often flooding in Cuyahoga Co, the Cleveland area, which am well acquainted with. Plus with storms, the entire 6 lane interstate often had to be closed for days, before it was rebuilt quite some ways south of the shores.

This explains largely why sea level determinations are WAY too inaccurate and fluctuating even under the best of measuring conditions, because those are complex systems, and the variations, like the weather, completely cover up any man made or natural ""averages"" or effects.",0
