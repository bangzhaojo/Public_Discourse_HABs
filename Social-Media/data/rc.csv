1,"Hmm I guess we all have different views. I work for a Planning District Commission (urban and regional city planning) and this is not our general consensus about the James alongside our environmental specialists. Still regarded as having high TMDL levels (total maximum daily load of toxins in a water body) and sediment levels. Just my experience and research. Probably safer than 10 years ago, but not safe enough to swim in without moderate health risk. Personally don‚Äôt let me dog go near the water, just the rocks"

3,"I agree that algae is quite normal and this does happen in the wild.  However, I believe fertilizers can exacerbate this‚Ä¶.  Similar to lake Eries algae bloom"
4,Ohio has a water border with Canada in Lake Erie
5,"I don't blame nutrient management staff. I blame the State for not having more of them and not enforcing violations.

I agree with you-- we need to hit the ""bad guys."" In the article, there are farms that are consistently non-compliant. 43% failed their follow-up inspections. Think of how many we are missing by having such a small team of investigators.

Maryland hasn't met its [TMDL Goals](https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2022-06/Maryland_2020-2021_2022_2023_evaluation_DRAFT_MS__6.27.2022.pdf) and I will admit it's not just poultry farms, but they are a big part of it."
6,"Some of the Republican's (in Michigan and across the U.S.) tout their main campaign goals to include, ""reduction of government regulation"".

So, expect more of these spills, PFAS, Dioxane, Dioxins, invasives,  ...


&gt; Brown pointed to those layered crises ‚Äì each stemming from industrial pollution ‚Äì as evidence that Michigan is at ‚Äúa point of reckoning‚Äù over policies that put ‚Äúthe profits of polluters over public health.‚Äù

&gt; State laws and policies that have failed to contain industrial pollution or hold polluters accountable after-the-fact, he said, and efforts to improve Michigan‚Äôs polluter pay laws have repeatedly faltered.

The company, Tribar, of Wixom, has been repeatedly responsible for several spill events in which they contaminated the Huron River from Wixom all the way down through Ann Arbor and into and including Lake Erie.

Yet they continue.  Business as usual.

""Reduction of regulations"".  Just what we need, since our government doesn't enforce regulations or hold violators accountable, right?"
7,"Ohio might not have much to contribute to a Lake Michigan initiative, though they should certainly set up / participate in an equivalent project for Lake Erie."
8,"and the great lakes are well familiar with pollution, this just seems like old hat from here

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;By the 1960s, Lake Erie had become sort of a ""poster child"" for water pollution. Pollutants from factories, waste from city sewers, and fertilizer and pesticides from farms made their way to the lake, according to Cleveland Historical. As a result, levels of phosphorus and nitrogen increased, which led to algae blooms. The toxic algae caused ""dead zones"" by depleting the oxygen, and dead fish littered the shoreline. And in 1969, the Cuyahoga River, which flows through Cleveland, Ohio, caught fire.

This same spill, we‚Äôre it to happen in Detroit, would be so diluted that it wouldn‚Äôt even register. I just don‚Äôt want people to freak out and think that the AA water is poisoned and/or that the same or worse could not happen to the Detroit system. From toxic algal blooms on Lake Erie, to Flint‚Äôs lead tragedy, and the Huron being used as a dump by industry, no water source is safe. Ann Arbor is better off spending its money on the existing system, at least there is some accountability if something does go wrong (maybe)."
16,Just fucking great! So after this chemical-laden river meanders through Michigan it empties into LAKE ERIE!!!  This ‚Äòspill‚Äô is criminal
17,Don‚Äôt act surprised when all the fish go belly up once the dioxane plume reaches the river. Huron River is probably full of more waste than Lake Erie
18,"Yes and the Great Lakes Water Authority (Detroit's system) has three intakes: one at Lake Huron, one at Lake St Clair and one at Lake Erie. The lakes are much higher volume so dilute contaminants and if water near a single intake is contaminated, there is redundancy in the system."
19,"Maybe, but there have been like zero days since a large amount of hazardous chemicals were spilt into a Lake Erie tributary. Not that there aren't any spills in the Gulf, but the Cuyahoga river and Rouge River have caught on fire before. Basically I would not hurry to jump in that lake."

21,"And farther below Lake Ontario, takes in what Lake Erie can send her."
22,Here in Buffalo you can't even really swim in the water of Lake Erie or the various rivers and creeks because there all contaminated with something.
23,"Its too big to not fail. The amount of water used over there is way more than you think. California alone uses enough water to drain Lake Erie dry in 9 years. Its two very different watersheds, so all that water is gone and not coming back to the great lakes. 

In reality, we need to adjust to not having the stuff that california gives us, cause there is literally enough water to sustain what we ask of it. Piping water in just makes our problem our grandkids problem."

Definitely not local. 25 years ago I sort of was. Born in Detroit, grew up on the  shores of Lake Erie."
46,"It‚Äôs so sad too because Michigan literally is our second home. We‚Äôre from NW Ohio, and we just cannot understand why this keeps happening. Lake Erie is literally green from algae blooms. These companies are killing our environment and they aren‚Äôt stopping. It breaks my heart."

48,"The State of Ohio needs to start charging farmers for fertilizer runoff. Lake Erie will continue to remain in ""poor"" condition until they are held accountable."
49,"Lake Erie might have it the toughest of any of the Great Lakes because it is so shallow and so much agriculture and industry has been built on it. 

I live near Buffalo and so it's not as bad over here with the algae blooms since this is the deeper side of the lake but I always hoped that Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York could agree on regulating livestock runoff and lobby for further cleaning of industrial waste.

I know here in Buffalo they've done a great job getting started on the cleaning of industrial waste and now the Buffalo River is used for a lot more boating, kayaking, etc... Definitely not something you'd want to swim in though still near the harbor in my opinion. Likewise the harbor has had a lot of cleaning being done from the waste from the Lackawanna steel mill that was dumped into the water. 

Especially with climate change suddenly feeling like it's coming on harder and faster than ever securing the health of the Great Lakes just seems like an awesome opportunity to continue to strengthen the appeal of the Rust Belt. I would love to see some Rust Belt/Great Lakes coalition that really comes together regionally to make it appealing to outsiders again. I know we're all still struggling with our national image and yet we have so much to offer."

Not every fertilizer is salt based either. Plenty of organic inputs are available"

I hate this spill. Last time going to the shore at Lake Erie I got shocked the amount of microplastics everywhere (beside the regular garbage). Quite sad.

And this is just in the US, a place you can get caught for polluting (hope so). I've visited some other places in the world that would make you cry."

64,"Lake Erie, the 4th largest lake in North America.

Always full of garbage, which ends up ashore, and not well maintained by the large Agency that gets most of its funding from property tax revenue. Kind of wiping their ass with the locals money. Feels like the ""MetroParks Rangers"" which are literally rent-a-cops who drive around looking for drug users get all the love.

Always reeks of death, too. Dead fish like to wash up everywhere and makes a beach day pretty unpleasant. And don't bother bringing your suit home. Once swam for a while and changed, threw my suit in a bag in the trunk. The trunk never smelled the same after. Thank god it was a rental. For as many severed crab arms I saw in Maine, not a single smell.

There's almost always a bacteria warning when you go but god knows everyone here has to be immune by now, but every time I go in I get some minor infection (granted only have gone a couple times recently.)

The people here are assholes, plain and simple. It's not uncommon to see a pile of paper plates or bottles just hanging out on the beach or at picnic tables. Have physically watched people just throw empty cans into the water or plant areas just because they couldn't carry it to the over-flowing dumpsters they never change out. My fianc√© and I once cleaned a half mile(?) stretch of beach in March. Nobody was there but it was covered in shit.

It's just bad. It's depressing, especially after seeing Maine and how well everyone keeps everything.

I've never been to the Canadian Side of the lake but I can promise you it's nowhere near as bad.

Edit: And one thing that REALLY culture-shocked me in Maine were the Seagulls. THEY EAT OUT OF THE SEA! Here they fly real far away from shore and eat Cheetos out of a parking lot. If they're at the beach, they bother everyone for their food. We call them ""Flying Garbage Cans"" since that's what they've gotten used to eating."
65,"[Great Lakes Offshore Wind Gets Boost From Ohio Supreme Court Ruling](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/great-lakes-offshore-wind-gets-boost-from-ohio-supreme-court-ruling-1.1804645)

&gt; (Bloomberg) -- Lake Erie Energy Development Corp. may resume its long-stalled efforts to build the first offshore wind project in the US Great Lakes after the Ohio Supreme Court rejected a challenge to its permit.  

&gt; The Cleveland-based company can construct six turbines in Lake Erie, the court ruled Wednesday, upholding the permit issued in 2020 by the Ohio Power Siting Board. The $127 million Icebreaker project would have about 21 megawatts of capacity and is intended to demonstrate the viability of offshore wind farms in the Great Lakes. 

&gt; Wind and solar have struggled to gain traction in Ohio, where renewables supplied about 2% of the state‚Äôs energy in 2020. The Icebreaker project faced pushback from local residents and the now-bankrupt coal producer Murray Energy Corp., which asserted that the board had failed to adequately consider the project‚Äôs potential impact on wildlife. The court rejected those claims. 

&gt; Lake Erie Development didn‚Äôt immediately respond to inquiries Thursday.

They will get an EPA fine. The fine will be covered by insurance. The state will declare a superfund site which will lower everybody's property values a ton. Some environmental group will attempt to clean up the river (it's too late. Toxins are there) and people will just watch it all flow down to lake Erie where it will be somebody else's problem (Ohio).

85,"Great video!

This could be cool for humans, since the Great Lakes Region will likely be one of the few comfortably habitable places in the US as climate change proceeds.

Sadly, however, our local ecology could hugely suffer from this. Just off the top of my head, the lack of a deep freeze will mean that more parasites survive the winter - which means more ticks and mosquitoes. More deer and other wild critters turning up with parasites (sorry, hunters and lovers of venison). 

The ecology of Lake Erie will probably go even more topsy-turvy than it already is.

86,"Not mosquitoes. Midges or Mayflies. And if they‚Äôre Mayflies they can‚Äôt bite. They don‚Äôt have mouths. They hatch, they fly, they mate and they die. The males die right after mating and females drop their eggs into a body of water and then die, too. I remember as a kid growing up on the shores of Lake Erie that the summertime swarms would be so huge that they would show up on weather radars. Bigger swarms also are a barometer for the good general health of a lake or river."
87,"The commercial fishing to come that decimated the pearch numbers on lake Erie are ready to do it again to the Walleye.

When we get out over them with my father and I, the bottom of the fish finder above the ground level looks like it's scanning aquatic plant life, it's thousands of walleye.

Even with charter boats taking fish out of the lake like that it's hardly a dent.  But once the commercial trot lines start yanking them up 100 at a time all day long it's over.

When I was in highschool in the 00s you could drop a crappie rig with 2 minnows down to the bottom and pull up 2 pearch, the limit was 50 a person and you'd clear the limit for a whole boat of people in an hour.  That's not the case anymore unless you go deep."
88,Yes. Look at what has happened to the ‚Äúendless perch‚Äù of Lake Erie. Almost every diner would have perch dinners on Friday nights near Lake Erie. Hardly any do now. Shit you can‚Äôt even find people who carry shiner minnows to fish with because no one can go perch finish!  They even lowered the limit to 10 perch in the Cleveland region.

94,Lake Erie is nice.
95,"I'd just like to make the point, as someone who grew up on a shitty farm and whose family are all farmers, small farmers can be just as bad, if not infinitely fucking worse, than commerical farmers. Commerical farmers have oversight, a lot of business can mean a lot of fines and do internal oversight so they don't get fucked by regulators, they try to skirt regulations, obviously, but they have a lot of eyes looking at them.

Small family farmers don't give a flying fuck. Lake Erie is basically an uninhabitable shithole now near Toledo specifically because of small family farmers who spend their time dumping toxic sludge into the lake and groundwater. They're the kind of guys to scream about how they'll be damned that the gubmint is going to tell them what to do and then do absolutely crazy shit that can be seriously  dangerous and bad for the environment. 

And while we like to pretend corporations have control over all legislation in the United states, they don't really, voters do. And the voters in Ohio are small family farmers and their relatives and you know what they fucking do? They vote for looser regulations for themselves so they can continue destroying all of Ohio Northwest.

Small family farmers can go fuck themselves."

128,"An interesting question and I'm not well read on the subject. I'd like to hear from the more informed. My only comment is that I understand most of that soluble nitrogen gets washed away from usable farmland, into water bodies as a pollutant often triggering things like Lake Erie toxic algea blooms. Eventually this dies and falls to the bottom layers and is effectively no longer contributing to the cycle  or carrying capacity.

Phosphorous is similar in that human waste and sanitation dumps the resource in a similar way. There was research on extracting key nutrients for reuse, but I don't think its been commercialized.

The ""easy"" solution of composting biological waste to be repurposed as fertilizer and keeping it as usable terrestrial sources has consequences of magnifying feedback loops of unwanted contaminants like pharmaceuticals, hormone disruptors, heavy metals, and now PFAS and microplastics. Closing the loop means closing the loop for better AND for worse."
129,Stop ruining the environment to catch fish. I fish lake erie every week and catch walleye without WD-40.
130,"The Detroit metropolitan area has a much larger population,  and includes more than just Detroit.  Also, being that it's on a waterway connected to two different Great Lakes,  and the area is known for having a high water table (parts of Lake Erie run beneath the SE portion of the state),  flooding happens.

I'd suggest taking a look at some of the past flooding that has plagued the area... Full underpasses have filled with water.  I was born and raised there,  and our basement  used to flood constantly because of this."

159,"Lovely how you fail to include the 13% increase in seeded area over the same time period.  You just assume that the yield increase was entirely due to fertilizer.  You also assume that the strains of wheat which we engineered over the past decade have no effect.  Right.  Fertilizer only has good impacts right?  

Lets talk about fertilizer that does not get used by the farmer's crops because they spray right before a rain.

What happens then?  Oh, it kills the entire fisher of Lake Erie?

Could we agree that the ideal situation is that farmers use of fertilizer reaches plants and not have fertilizer in our waterways?

Could we also agree that increasing the amount of fertilizer used increases the amount reaching our waterways?

Could we also agree that business as usual causes too much fertilizer in our waterways and maybe we need to find alternatives?"

5. Fertilizer is a CO2 intensive product.  We need to figure out how to reduce our consumption of it.

So, can we start over finding things we agree on?

&gt;Could we agree that the ideal situation is that fertilizer reaches plants and not have fertilizer in our waterways?

&gt;Could we also agree that current methods cause too much fertilizer to reach our waterways and maybe we need to find alternatives?"
164,"It doesn‚Äôt help that Lake Erie is the shallowest lake and it gets fairly warm. Doesn‚Äôt help with all the farm runoff. They really need to start making large farms responsible for the run off they create when they land apply just before the spring melt. We take water from the river as non-contact cooling water and have tested it before its combined with our effluent and have gotten 10+ mg/L phosphorus in some of our tests. It‚Äôs crazy they‚Äôre allowed to dump that amount into the rivers and streams but My plant is only allowed to discharge a max of 1 mg/L.

Edit: forgot to mention there are several farms upriver of my plant so we can see when they land apply and how much of it runs off cuz it affects our results. Our phosphorus limits are based on the outfall where both our effluent and non-contact cooling water mix before discharging. So we get violations cuz of the farms upstream."
165,"Yes Lake Erie is quite shallow and can get massive algae blooms, but we know that‚Äôs largely from agricultural runoff. Despite our conservative leadership (Republican in hiding) we have some solid controls though to try and prevent this from being a regular occurrence. Our water treatment plants are right next to the lake, and the majority of the cost is in (1) chemicals to treat the water and (2) the infrastructure. Currently it seems quite sustainable as long as we can continue with the supply of chemicals to treat them properly."

170,"In the 1950s and 60s this was a vast sprawling cesspool, a network of toxic chemical swamps and ponds, **bright orange in color** and terribly forbidding and smelly. We used to go down to Gallagher beach at the end of Tifft on our bikes to skip stones, holding our breath as we zoomed past to avoid breathing in the acrid stench. We never swam in Lake Erie there because it was so disturbingly polluted. Tifft might look good today, but knowing what I know from personal experience I would never set foot in there.

We went to Cedar Point on Friday, and the dead fish smell was potent and the algae is definitely picking up. There‚Äôs toxic algae types in Lake Erie.

I would check the water quality before letting them get in. Lake Erie is not really a swimming lake. You can swim in it, but it‚Äôs not recommended.

For example, at a beach in Sandusky, very close to Cedar Point beach, that was just tested on July 1st. The E. coli levels tested at 1299.7 cfu/100ml. 

Be careful."
192,"Yes! I don‚Äôt live in Sandusky, but I live on Lake Erie. It does get that way after it rains from runoff from agriculture, hence the E. Coli. After that happens, the water temperature increasing and the lack of rain can actually make the algae blooms worse, so rain isn‚Äôt always the best indicator.

Rain or not, it‚Äôs always good to check the water quality before going in! Just because it looks okay doesn‚Äôt mean that it is."

Fecal coliform data from 1993-1994

[2014 Watershed Management Plan Upper Chestatee Watershed](https://epd.georgia.gov/document/document/chestatee-river/download)

Fecal coliform data from 2002-2003

On 6/5/2002 the Fecal Coliform level spiked to 16000. The report doesn't mention why the level spiked. Google shows 6/5 as National Moonshine Day.

&gt;This segment of the river was listed on the Georgia 303 (d) list of impaired water bodies due to high fecal coliform readings obtained during sampling events in 2002 and 2003.  
&gt;  
&gt;Based on the preliminary review of land use and development, suggested possible causes of increased levels of fecal coliform into the river include: human waste from sewage leaks or septic tank leaks, development activities, logging activities, domestic animals, urban wildlife, livestock, or rural wildlife.  
&gt;  
&gt;The upper Chestatee River watershed does not have access to any public sewer and limited access to public water. All of the properties within the watershed rely on a septic system of some kind.  
&gt;  
&gt;The upper Chestatee River watershed targeted here has been identified as impaired with regard to fecal colioform bacterial levels permissible under the standards for streams with a designated use of Fishing. A stream is placed on this list if more than 10% of the samples exceed the fecal coliform criteria."

233,"I think the people disparaging OP should realize just how bad it was back in the day, and then also see that a lot of the info saying it's okay to swim in is based in Portland, and not in Salem. 

I was raised in Salem and never allowed to play in the river because it was always greenish (which is a sign of algae). The Simpsons' three eyed fish jokes and such were based on the Willamette as Matt Groening grew up in Eugene/Springfield and the Willamette there was also off limits. 
 I visited Riverfront two weeks ago, it was still greenish and had beer cans floating at the dock near the old wheelboat. I wouldn't drink it, definitely wouldn't pay the possible 600-900 bucks of a triathlon fee to swim in it. 

So here's some news from recently (as in 2022 recently) and know that I absolutely think the Ironman Triathlon would charge people several hundred dollars to swim in garbage water, especially because they probably only look at Portland statistics and not Salem ones.

239,"Welcome to the best, but still seriously-flawed, State in the union. I always knew Ohio was trash, but that kind of behavior is grounds to revoke Midwest from their culture. All this is. They looked south for their inspiration, and bet on conservatism with all its associated hate. 

I was in Ohio for a dirt track race during the primaries, and immediately knew he would win Ohio. They're just silly for an excuse to throw stones - awful, awful people. They drive drunk more than the rest of the country, they poison their own lakes, and they cause the bloom in Lake Erie along with Ontario every other year."
240,"The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down
Of the big lake they called Gitche Gumee
The lake, it is said, never gives up her dead
When the skies of November turn gloomy
With a load of iron ore twenty-six thousand tons more
Than the Edmund Fitzgerald weighed empty
That good ship and true was a bone to be chewed
When the gales of November came early
The ship was the pride of the American side
Coming back from some mill in Wisconsin
As the big freighters go, it was bigger than most
With a crew and good captain well seasoned
Concluding some terms with a couple of steel firms
When they left fully loaded for Cleveland
And later that night when the ship's bell rang
Could it be the north wind they'd been feelin'?
The wind in the wires made a tattle-tale sound
And a wave broke over the railing
And every man knew, as the captain did too
T'was the witch of November come stealin'
The dawn came late and the breakfast had to wait
When the gales of November came slashin'
When afternoon came it was freezin' rain
In the face of a hurricane west wind
When suppertime came, the old cook came on deck sayin'
""Fellas, it's too rough to feed ya""
At seven PM, a main hatchway caved in, he said
""Fellas, it's been good to know ya""
The captain wired in he had water comin' in
And the good ship and crew was in peril
And later that night when his lights went outta sight
Came the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald
Does any one know where the love of God goes
When the waves turn the minutes to hours?
The searchers all say they'd have made Whitefish Bay
If they'd put fifteen more miles behind her
They might have split up or they might have capsized
They may have broke deep and took water
And all that remains is the faces and the names
Of the wives and the sons and the daughters
Lake Huron rolls, Superior sings
In the rooms of her ice-water mansion
Old Michigan steams like a young man's dreams
The islands and bays are for sportsmen
And farther below Lake Ontario
Takes in what Lake Erie can send her
And the iron boats go as the mariners all know
With the gales of November remembered
In a musty old hall in Detroit they prayed
In the maritime sailors' cathedral
The church bell chimed 'til it rang twenty-nine times
For each man on the Edmund Fitzgerald
The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down
Of the big lake they called Gitche Gumee
Superior, they said, never gives up her dead
When the gales of November come early"

252,"From Wikipedia:

&gt;Balloonfest '86¬†was a 1986 event in¬†Cleveland,¬†Ohio,¬†United States, in which the local chapter of¬†United Way¬†set a¬†world record¬†by¬†releasing¬†almost 1.5 million¬†balloons.[2]¬†The event was intended to be a harmless¬†fundraising¬†publicity stunt, but the balloons drifted back over the city,¬†Lake Erie, and landed in the surrounding area, causing problems for traffic and a nearby airport. The event also interfered with a¬†United States Coast Guard¬†search for two boaters who were later found drowned.[1]¬†In consequence, the organizers and the city faced lawsuits seeking millions of dollars in¬†damages,[1]¬†and cost overruns put the event at a net loss.[3]

&gt;Typically, a helium-filled latex balloon that is released outdoors will stay aloft long enough to be fully deflated before it descends to Earth.[6] However, the Balloonfest balloons collided with a front of cool air and rain and dropped towards the ground, still inflated, clogging the land and waterways of Northeast Ohio. In the days following the event, many balloons were reported washed ashore on the Canadian side of Lake Erie causing water pollution.[5]

&gt;Two fishermen, Raymond Broderick and Bernard Sulzer, who had gone out on September 26, were reported missing by their families on the day of the event. Rescuers spotted their 16-foot (4.9 m) boat anchored west of the Edgewater Park breakwall. A Coast Guard search and rescue helicopter crew had difficulties reaching the area because of the ""asteroid field"" of balloons.[7] A search-and-rescue boat crew tried to spot the fishermen floating in the lake, but Guard officials said balloons in the water made it impossible to see whether anyone was in the lake.[1] On September 29, the Coast Guard suspended its search. The fishermen's bodies subsequently washed ashore. The wife of one of the fishermen sued the United Way of Cleveland and the company that organized the balloon release for $3.2 million and later settled on undisclosed terms.[1]

&gt;Balloons landing on a pasture in Medina County, Ohio, spooked Louise Nowakowski's Arabian horses, which allegedly suffered permanent injuries as a result. Nowakowski sued the United Way of Cleveland for $100,000 in damages and settled for undisclosed terms.[1]

&gt;Burke Lakefront Airport had to shut down a runway for half an hour after balloons landed there.[1][3] Traffic collisions were also reported ""as drivers swerved to avoid slow motion blizzards of multicolored orbs or took their eyes off the road to gawk at the overhead spectacle"".[3]

&gt;The 1988 copy of The Guinness Book of World Records recognizes the event as a world record ""largest ever mass balloon release"", with 1,429,643 balloons launched.[8][9] Because of the damage caused, Guinness no longer measures environmentally unsound events like balloon releases."
253,"Swimming in lakes and oceans gives me an immediate anxiety attack. Chest tightness, shakiness, feels like you can't breathe. Some of it is a fear of drowning, sometimes it's stepping on a crab or jellyfish, or getting mauled by a sea creature. I could probably alleviate some of it if I spent time with friends that were more comfortable with the ocean, or lived by a lake that wasn't a sewage pit (Lake Erie ü§¢)."

Its 20 years ago for me so not sure if that's still a happening area. I heard Cleveland was a drag before going there on business but not true in my limited experience. I mean, there was a time when Lake Erie caught on fire nearly the Cleveland lakefront if I'm not mistaken, so the revitalization is pretty remarkable."

267,That looks just like the shitty Skyway in Buffalo that they've been trying to get rid of for decades now because it completely ruined the Lake Erie Waterfront.

271,"Not just one time. The incident that is reported in Times Magazine is one of many incidents. That fire wasnt as bad as others. Yes, it had caused millions of dollars in damage but there were other fires that burned for days and others that killed people. 

On the plus side, people can thank Cleveland for catching the river on fire for helping push the creation of the EPA and the passing of the Clean Water Act. In the 60s and 70s you couldnt find many, if any fish in the Cuyahoga River or the nearby area of Lake Erie. Now, people can fish and swim in the area with little to now issue or worry. The biggest worry now is when it rains and the sewer system 'purges' the lines and dumps into the lake, helping create and algea bloom."
272,"OMG, a friend juuuuuuust told me about Balloonfest last night!  I had vaguely heard something about it, but had forgotten all about it. 

Apparently it complicated a missing person search on Lake Erie?"
273,"This type of filter is small enough that is prevents micro organisms from making it through the filter. Its not a bag type filter that just has chunks of charcoal in it. It is basically like a solid cylinder -- All I know is, when I put water in the top container (that has micro organisms visible under microscope) and then slide samples of water after filtration, there aren't any. It's the same type of filtration system that camp filters like Katadyn and Sawyer use -- and those also prevent bacteria like giardia, e coli, cholera, cynobacteria and microcystins.

I learned all of this back when the area I live in had a huge microcystin outbreak in the water supply for our area (Lake Erie/Superior). People went crazy, going out of state to buy water, fighting each other in the stores and otherwise being terrible. I am currently friends with a guy who works at our water treatment plant and he tells me these types of filters are the only ones that are 99.9% effective."
274,"Costa Rica is creating large marine reserves, California is tough on plastic and pollution, India banned single use plastic, lots of local projects work together to heal ecosystems across the world when the federal government refuses to. One great example is how lake Erie in my home state was murdered then, after a while, it was cleaned and life returned to the region because the people realized that they could and should do something about the decline of their home. To add onto this, almost every reserve on earth is a part of the healing process for our earth so there's that."
275,"I remember when Lake Erie was so polluted and dead, we weren't allowed to swim in it.  The beach was gross, and my cousins and I preferred to chase frogs in the nearby swamp at my great uncle's cottage.

Granted, that was mostly industrial pollution."
276,They were thick enough on Lake Erie to short a big transformer and trip Fermi II off line both this year and last.
277,"Reminds me of mayflies on the Lake Erie islands. We used snow shovels to scoop their dead bodies off the sidewalks in the morning, filling wheelbarrows and dumping them in a pit in the field."
278,"As an ecologist, I love to see it. This is a good sign.  I‚Äôm also interested because I‚Äôm pretty sure there is an algae bloom on Lake Erie near Monroe right now. Fish flies aka mayflies from the order Ephemeroptera (pretty sure genus is Hexagenia for these swarms) live in the lake bottom (aka benthos) as nymphs for up to 2 years before emerging as the winged adults that you see on land. They burrow in the soft sediments and are and indicator of good water quality. They feed on detritus, or decomposing bits that fall to the lake bottom. In some parts of the Great Lakes, these mayfly swarms don‚Äôt happen anymore due to pollution and human altered habitat. The emerging adults provide abundant food for fish. If they make out of the water, they‚Äôll mate, lay eggs on the water, then die. 

A lot of other common summer insects have similar life cycles - dragonflies and damselflies spend most of their life cycle as aquatic nymphs as well. Dragonfly nymphs are fierce predators - there‚Äôs some pretty cool YouTube videos of them eating small minnows and other bugs that live on the bottom of the water column (aka benthic invertebrates)."
279,"Did you not hear the part about roads being much cheaper than rails. And just a few miles west of me is Framingham, which is not particularly rich, but they are very auto-oriented.

285,. . . hopefully the toxic algal blooms in Lake Erie won't act up again any time soon.
286,"Is it drinkable or is it full of cyanobacteria from your farm runoff? 

&gt; Since the late 1990s, Lake Erie has been plagued with blooms of toxic algae that turn its waters a bright blue-green. These harmful algae blooms are made up of cyanobacteria that produce the liver toxin microcystin.

&gt;The blooms have led to public warnings to avoid water contact. In August 2014, for example, high microcystin concentrations were detected in drinking water from the lake.s a result, the water supply to 400,000 people in Toledo, Ohio, was shut down.

287,"[You can't forget their 1986 Balloon Fest, where they released over a million balloons to break a world record.

288,We need to keep protecting and improving our waterways. Lake Erie is still highly at risk and altered from over a century of human intervention. Runoff from the Maumee River has made the western side of the lake particularly toxic at times. Same with our rivers. As an agricultural state we need stronger regulation of our waterways not less. Ohio has an abundance of fresh water and this needs to viewed as something worth protecting and fighting for. All Ohio residents need to read *The Death and Life of The Great Lakes* by Dan Egan. It is essential reading.

Unless you feel like buying antibiotic for the kids after their swim, stick to Lake Erie. Even then check the water quality websites before going."
297,"I grew up in Ohio, we had rivers catching fire and Lake Erie was declared ‚Äúdead‚Äù due to pollution and sewage causing major algae blooms that choked out oxygen and killed fish.  Swimming was highly dangerous for people, and they closed 59 of 62 beaches to swimming in 1969. Then the clean water act of 1972 stopped most of the pollution and sewage from entering the lake and the lake has recovered.  There are still environmental issues with the Lake including legacy pollution, invasive species, occasional algae blooms, and bacteria that make swimming dangerous on some beaches, but it‚Äôs not ‚Äúdead‚Äù."

There are 7.5 billion people on Earth. The urinary bladder can store up to 500 ml of urine in women and 700 ml in men (generally speaking).

To make this easier, I am using the 700 ml figure instead of figuring out averages by gender and also taking into account different bladder sizes belonging to children and babies.

If all 7.5 billion people peed an entire bladder of urine at the same time, that would amount to 5.25 trillion liters of urine.

The volume of the smallest ocean, the Arctic Ocean, (if we're talking ocean basins) is 18,750,000 cubic km. Our cumulative urine would fill .00525 cubic km.

If we're using the smallest sea, the Baltic sea has 20,900 cubic km of volume or 3,980,952.38 larger area.

Even the smallest of the five Great Lakes, Lake Erie, is over 91,428.57 times larger with 480 cubic km.

Again, I'm not taking into account true bladder sizes (and that we don't need to pee when they are completely full but start to need to pee around a third to half fullness), and I'm also using basins and seas, as the global ocean is actually considered one large body (not going to even try to go into those numbers since they're too big to relate to).

So no, we couldn't create an ocean of pee. The Earth is a lot larger than people think."

351,"Yes, it's colder in Ohio in winter than in Florida, but also much cooler in summers, with no risk of hurricanes and no accelerated sea level rise.

Yet, it's much warmer than 50 years ago during Ohio winters.

I just looked at monthly temperatures by day at [Accuweather.com](https://Accuweather.com) for Cleveland for December 2021.  There were NO days with a low below 20 degrees F.

In January 2022, the coldest month of the past winter, there were only 4 days with lows below 10 degrees F.

In February 2022, there were only two days with lows below 10 degrees F.

Accuweather shows no days in the winter of 2021-2022 with lows below zero.

Weatherunderground says there was one day in January 2022 with a low below zero, but the average low in January 2022 was 16.81 degrees F.  In January 1972, the coldest low was -14 degrees F., with an average low temperature of 9.55 degrees F.

If you examine highs similarly, you realize that Ohio winters now are punctuated with thaws and highs above freezing, sometimes well above freezing.  This results in much lower snow accumulations.

What's extraordinarily important, and not understood by Ohioans, Americans, and certainly not by our politicians based on their public comments, warming will accelerate even more rapidly going forward barring a rapid transition away from fossil fuel consumption.  Natural feedback loops, such the thawing of the North American permafrost releasing massive amounts of greenhouse gases, have the potential to overwhelm the environment.

Arctic Amplification more directly impacts Ohio, as every year there is simply less Arctic cold air available to reach down into Ohio.

Western Europe and the US struggled with sewage and trash problems until about the late 19th / early 20th century. Cities were cesspools before then.

Even then, Lake Erie by Cleveland was famously engulfed in flames because it was so polluted in the 1960s. Pittsburgh's air was so dirty that in the 40s, people called it ""Hell with the Lid Blown Off.""

356,"Less property rights to deal with and less NIMBY-ism opposition generally for ocean/offshore turbines at the tradeoff for increased engineering complexity and higher up-front cost.

Still not really convinced this is the way to go. 

The great lakes have significant engineering challenges, the great lakes are typically too deep where wind is the strongest and most constant for energy capture, which means that they need to leverage floating wind turbine platforms, not fixed-bottom. 

Wind turbines have focused on Ohio specifically because Lake Erie is the shallowest of the great lakes, which enables them to use fixed bottom turbines. All of the other great lakes are too deep for fixed bottom turbines which means that they would need to use floating turbine platforms.

Floating turbines have significant engineering hurdles with freshwater lakes, largely the formation of the huge ice sheets and ice floes over the great lakes."
357,"Great lakes are typically too deep for fixed bottom turbines except for Lake Erie (which is why the turbine research for great lakes deployment has focused on Lake Erie so far) where wind energy is the strongest and sustained. 

Jacket foundations are what have to be used and they're generally only economical to install to a depth maximum of 50 meters (which is typically pushing it anyway). Jacket foundations *work* to deeper depths, 60-70 meters, but the cost scaling makes it economically non-viable.

Floating turbines are still commercially immature. Only 3 installed farms of them exist in the world, and none of them exist in places that experience significant ice formation and ice floe activity and in a freshwater environment."

363,"MRpolo13 is correct, old iron furnaces and steel mills needed power (from water) and they still needs lots of water itself, but there is also more to it.  Raw material production of most kinds produces a lot of waste, and production of metal from ore is the same.  In *modern* steelmaking, about 1/2 of slag is produced for every 1 ton of iron.  Modern industry tries to find a beneficial and moneymaking reuse for these materials, and modern slag is used for making cement, glass fibers, agricultural soil treatments, aggregate, and other things.  Most of it gets reused today.  But the ratio of slag to steel production was higher back then, and the reuse was limited.  High supply, low demand...an iron furnace could soon be drowning in its own slag if it were not dumped or dispersed far away from the mill.  Most larger towns had a mill of some kind, outside of town, and slag would be dumped around the mill for as long as possible.  It was also given away just to get rid of it, and was hauled away and used road and railroad base, it was used to fill in low areas for construction and development, it was just dumped down riverbanks and into stream beds and the ocean, and to make dikes and levees, and it was used as landfill to fill in ocean bays and the bays in the Great Lakes.  In 1969, Bethlehem Steel received permits from the US and local govt's to dump 1.5 MILLION TONS of slag per year into Lake Erie at their facility in Lackawanna NY.  A lot of that is still there, and there is a whole valley filled with it in Bethlehem, PA.  So - there was a lot of it produced, it got spread all over the place, and it is inorganic and doesn't degrade.  So we still have it scattered around.  Sorry if TLDR."

In fact, the state says: ""Fish in northeastern Minnesota have significantly higher mercury concentrations than fish in the rest of the state."" (source: [https://www.pca.state.mn.us/water/statewide-mercury-tmdl](https://www.pca.state.mn.us/water/statewide-mercury-tmdl) ). They officially recommend no more than one fish per week from freshwater sources. My old college friend said even that was a stupid allowance, since the body never really gets rid of mercury -- once it's there, it's there, so better not to eat any freshwater fish at all.

There is no 'isolation' from mercury pollution, at least that's my understanding. The stuff gets in the atmosphere from burning coal, and can circulate globally before coming down in rainfall. Massive coal plants in Asia could very well be a major source of our mercury pollution, even in the Midwest."

It will add a significant amount of wetland on site that will minimize the quantity needed off site to achieve the water quality goals set out in the lake‚Äôs TMDL. It does not block the work upstream that will be needed in addition to the work at the lake. And it shows the upstream communities like Edina and St. Louis park that Minneapolis is willing to do its part. Why should we expect them to make efforts if we will not?

And I would ask you the same question I would of any golf supporter: if you want the water quality to improve what is your plan? Where would you restore or install wetlands to do that upstream? What evidence do you have that whatever location you have in mind would be a more effective spot than at Hiawatha, or be more politically feasible?

Also: how can you argue that it will not improve _trash_ pollution at the lake when currently there is a pipe that delivers enormous quantities of trash direct from the streets of our city to the lake, and with the plan there will be a sizable catchment area where this trash can settle, floc, and/or be filtered? How is that not a significant improvement?

And regarding money: the site is within the Nokomis-Hiawatha Regional park and as such will qualify for regional park and water quality dollars from the Met Council and possibly the state. The cost will not be 100% on Minneapolis taxpayers, unlike the likely situation the next time the course floods."

anyway..... when i was growing up lake erie was declared a dead zone, rivers were so polluted they caught on fire, and air in cities was too dangerous to breathe

it was the boomer generation that confronted those issues, put mpg regs on cars, reduced smokestack emissions, fought coal burning etc.  imagine where we would be had they not done so

boomers identified and raised the alarm about climate change before many of the younger generation were even born.  they've been at it for *decades*.  but progress has been frustratingly slow, very slow, impeded at every turn by corporate interests

sadly, corporate money is a determining factor in US politics.  it takes a HUGE amount of money to run for office, and that pushes candidates right into the welcoming embrace of corporate donors and lobbyists (actually, it's often worse than that - corporations decide who they want to run and fund their candidacy)

That's a significant reduction from the 4.5 billion gallons that they have been releasing, and similar in nature to what Milwaukee's deep tunnel project has achieved.  


&gt;During the 1970s, an estimated nine billion gallons of untreated water would flow into Lake Erie during heavy rains, and even though they were able to reduce that to 4.5 billion gallons, Cleveland was still found to be in violation of the Federal Clean Water Act and was mandated to come up with a solution. Project Clean Lake will eventually take that to under a half billion gallons a year.

-	Lake Erie (and specifically the Erie Canal) connect to the Atlantic Ocean, and was the 1st major water trade route from the Midwest to the Atlantic. 
-	the Ohio River connects to the Mississippi River, giving great access to the many trade outlets doted all along the Mississippi from Middle America to the Deep South.

411,"The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down
Of the big lake they called Gitche Gumee
The lake, it is said, never gives up her dead
When the skies of November turn gloomy
With a load of iron ore twenty-six thousand tons more
Than the Edmund Fitzgerald weighed empty
That good ship and true was a bone to be chewed
When the gales of November came early

The ship was the pride of the American side
Coming back from some mill in Wisconsin
As the big freighters go, it was bigger than most
With a crew and good captain well seasoned
Concluding some terms with a couple of steel firms
When they left fully loaded for Cleveland
And later that night when the ship's bell rang
Could it be the north wind they'd been feelin'?

The wind in the wires made a tattle-tale sound
And a wave broke over the railing
And every man knew, as the captain did too
T'was the witch of November come stealin'
The dawn came late and the breakfast had to wait
When the gales of November came slashin'
When afternoon came it was freezin' rain
In the face of a hurricane west wind

When suppertime came, the old cook came on deck sayin'
""Fellas, it's too rough to feed ya""
At seven PM, a main hatchway caved in, he said
""Fellas, it's been good to know ya""
The captain wired in he had water comin' in
And the good ship and crew was in peril
And later that night when his lights went outta sight
Came the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald

Does any one know where the love of God goes
When the waves turn the minutes to hours?
The searchers all say they'd have made Whitefish Bay
If they'd put fifteen more miles behind her
They might have split up or they might have capsized
They may have broke deep and took water
And all that remains is the faces and the names
Of the wives and the sons and the daughters

Lake Huron rolls, Superior sings
In the rooms of her ice-water mansion
Old Michigan steams like a young man's dreams
The islands and bays are for sportsmen
And farther below Lake Ontario
Takes in what Lake Erie can send her
And the iron boats go as the mariners all know
With the gales of November remembered

In a musty old hall in Detroit they prayed
In the maritime sailors' cathedral
The church bell chimed 'til it rang twenty-nine times
For each man on the Edmund Fitzgerald
The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down
Of the big lake they called Gitche Gumee
Superior, they said, never gives up her dead
When the gales of November come early"

413,"With loving respect, having spent years in Purdue's  College of Ag, no one is suppressing cover crops. 

It is a continuously promoted. As is proper crop rotation, alt drainage strategies, and no and reduced tillage, and residue resupply.

In FACT, the recent euthropication problems in Lake Erie are do to so many Ohio farmers adopted no till ag.

See, in fresh water systems, Phosphorous is normally the limiting nutrient. (In salt water systems like the Gulf of Mexico, it's nitrogen). But phosphorous is normally spread as a solid, and it needs close soil contact to become fixed. But no till helps build up a layer of plant matter on the surface. This plant matter is generally great, supporting soil carbon, microbial and soil fauna, and helping retain moisture. But if the P fertilizer falls on it, it won't fix to the soil. Then rain can carry it down to water.

So wholesale promotion of no till without modifying P fertilization strategies caused the eutrophication. Spreading news of incorporation needs has helped reduce that algae problem in Erie while maintaining the benefits of no till farming (to soil carbon. Of course pesticide use generally goes way up in no till). 

Point is: the extensions go fucking hard on no till, CC, carbon amendments, and high precision fertilizer application. All of this is regenerative ag, which usually an undefined term to mean ""whatever strategies I prefer""."

my point is that we somehow came out of all that (or most of it) and left it for the history books.  

global heating is the greatest challenge ever faced by humankind.  it's also the first worldwide global challenge and it will require a global response.  there's some hope in that for a better world

So I started watching, and kept watching and watching, waiting for the part where they were actually in Toronto.

I promised y'all some insider info on these episodes, so here it is. Starting with [Niagara Falls](
https://maps.app.goo.gl/9ToqNrbT33XSPR9YA). The falls is located on the Niagara River, which runs between Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. The river splits in that region, creating two separate falls, one located on the American side, and one on the Canadian side. In the scene where the boys are looking at the falls through the viewer, they are only seeing the American side, which is a regularly shaped, straight falls. The place where they filmed the staring competition and other challenges is called [Queen Victoria Park ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dZYAgfS2DtLRYR7D9)  (RIP Queen Vicky), and then they went to see the American falls right across the street, at this [Niagara River Viewpoint](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bJ75tS38pvbkcK8P6). You can see a bit of the Canadian falls from there too, but this is really not the best spot for it. It's a shame that the staff didn't take them to [this spot](https://maps.app.goo.gl/iTL2Xdscu1m6ALvVA) further down on the fallsview trail (unless they did so off-camera), because as spectacular as the American falls is, the Canadian one is breath-taking. It is wider, taller, horseshoe shaped, and a larger volume of water flows through there. Anyway, they then went to the Korean restaurant, and then stopped to shop in Hamilton. I would assume that the lakefront cottage property they stayed at was somewhere in Hamilton as well, judging by the fact that their 2018 concert was in Hamilton and the shopping scenes we see are at a plaza in Hamilton. The store they went to shop for groceries at is called [FreshCo](https://freshco.com/), and the clothing store is called [Mark's Work Warehouse ](https://www.marks.com/). It is hilarious to me that they shopped for clothes at Mark's of all places, because as the name suggests, it's a specialty store where you can find work-specific clothes. For example, scrubs if you're in a medical profession, PVC overalls if you're fishing, etc. (Disappointed that Jin did not pick up the fishing overalls LOL). The Jacket Yoongi tried on was in the ""hunting and outdoor"" section and that's how we know this man can pull off literally any look. You may be wondering at this point how I know for sure that they were in Hamilton. The landmark giveaway is the restaurant in the back of the parking lot shot. [Fran's](https://www.fransrestaurant.com/about) is an iconic landmark 24hr diner in Ontario, and its logo is unmistakable. The franchise has always carried very few locations at a time, and around this time, the only location outside of Toronto was in Hamilton.

https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/02/sport/ohio-fishing-tournament-cheating-scandal-trnd/index.html

There's something fishy going on in the competitive fishing world.

The would-be winners of almost $29,000 at an Ohio fishing tournament were disqualified on Friday, after it was discovered their fish were stuffed with lead weights and fish fillets.

Jason Fischer, director of the Lake Erie Walleye Trail tournament, told CNN he was immediately suspicious when one team's fish weighed almost twice what he expected they would at the Cleveland championship weigh-in.

The walleye in the bucket looked like they should each weigh around 4 pounds, but the total weight indicated they would have to be at least 7 pounds each, he said.

[snip]

The moment when Fischer discovered the alleged cheating was documented in several now-viral videos posted on social media, showing Fischer, surrounded by competitors, slice open the fish with a knife and pull out what he said was a lead ball. Jacob Runyan, one member of the two-person team who allegedly cheated, stood by silently watching in one video Fischer shared with CNN.

Tournaments like this are no joke.  The participants invest in their boats and equipment the same way competitive figure skaters invest in coaching and costumes.

The guys (and it‚Äôs almost all guys) are tired and cranky and tempers are short.

From the Erie County Parks Master Plan:

Chestnut Ridge Park is one of the original Erie County 
Parks, beginning its development in 1926. Much of the 
park construction was handled through the WPA work 
force through the 1930s; this consisted of shelters, pump 
shelters, colony ovens, and pavilions. The most significant 
and prominent structure was and is the Casino, a stone 
building sitting atop a hill overlooking the surrounding park 
and community. The original timber Casino was built in 
1925, and destroyed by fire in 1932. The present day stone 
Casino was completed in 1938 by nearly 50 employees of 
the WPA. The use of stone in the construction of the park 
during the days of the WPA provided its structures with a 
rustic feel. The flagstone area behind the building allows 
park users to gaze upon marvelous views out towards 
Buffalo and even far out beyond Lake Erie to Canada. 
The design of bridges and cabins blended into the 
natural beauty of the park and 3.5 miles of roads were 
constructed to allow access to the natural areas of the 
park. The diversified forest provides many habitats to 
wildlife and opportunities for relief from urban living.

Still enough population to form mutual aid networks, but not so much that things might get violent and hostile between major population centers in a collapse. The coastal area around Lake Erie in Ohio is heavily populated, to the point where I would be wary of SHTF situations happening the minute people start panicking.  
I'm anticipating access to freshwater being one of the top concerns in a future collapse + climate change situation, and northern Michigan is fully surrounded by two huge Great Lakes (Michigan and Huron) both of which have better water quality than Erie.

Voters got a chance to hear directly from the two candidates for Ohio House District 41 as Democrat Nancy Larson and Republican Josh Williams faced off Wednesday in a debate that highlighted far more differences than similarities.

The debate, hosted by WTVG-TV, Channel 13 and The Blade at the station‚Äôs studio, saw the candidates address hot-button topics such as crime and abortion, as well as their plans for finding solutions to local-level issues. They include protecting Lake Erie and how to spend the state‚Äôs pool of American Rescue Act funding.

Ms. Larson, a social worker from Sylvania, said that she feels the outcome of the election will determine ‚Äúwhether we have more or less freedom when it's over.‚Äù She added that the work she has done through 40 years in the field has allowed her to help ‚Äúthousands‚Äù of people during her career.

Mr. Williams, a criminal defense attorney and Oregon resident, said in his opening statement that he wants to ‚Äúmake it easier for every single motivated Ohioan to dig themselves out of the circumstances and grow to their true potential.‚Äù

He described his own story of going from a high school dropout and being disabled from a work accident to becoming a college graduate and a practicing attorney.

The 41st House District was put in place as a part of the state‚Äôs recent redistricting process. It stretches from Richfield Township to Jerusalem Township, encompassing Sylvania, Oregon, and parts of North Toledo, including Point Place, along the way.

Whitmer High School is not in the candidates‚Äô district, but part of Washington Local School District is in the district. Both candidates addressed how they want to lower crime in the community in the wake of Friday‚Äôs shooting outside a football game at Whitmer. Three people were wounded. 

Ms. Larson argued for more ‚Äúsensible‚Äù gun laws and a focus on funding for afterschool programs and community policing.

Mr. Williams said that the solution lies within ensuring that the state ‚Äúproperly funds the police‚Äù and considering stricter penalties for violent offenders. They include a ‚Äú10-year minimum‚Äù gun specification ‚Äúfor the use of guns in violent crimes.‚Äù

On the issue of police reform, both candidates agreed that qualified immunity should be removed. Qualified immunity is when officers are ‚Äúimmune from civil liability when they act outside the bounds of their authority,‚Äù Mr. Williams said.

When the topic of abortion was addressed, the candidates differed greatly. Ms. Larson said that she wants to return to the abortion protections that were allowed by Roe vs. Wade.

Mr. Williams argued that the GOP-backed ‚Äúheartbeat bill‚Äù would still allow for abortions for up to six weeks. He added that he would support abortion exceptions for pregnancies that threaten the life of the mother.

Ohio has to find a way to spend more than $5 billion in American Rescue Plan Act funding for continued recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. Both candidates hope to find a way to maximize northwest Ohio‚Äôs share of that fund, if elected.

Mr. Williams said that he wants to see the money go toward ‚Äújob creation and workforce development,‚Äù and an expansion of job training programs. Ms. Larson wants to see more funding for the University of Toledo, establishing a community college in downtown Toledo, and investing further in clean energy development.

During the hour-long debate, the pair also sparred over how to best protect one of the region's most important natural resources in Lake Erie. Both have differences in what they believe is the root cause of what pollutes the lake.

Ms. Larson said that the state needs to stop permitting ‚Äúconcentrated animal farms‚Äù and look into disbanding existing farms that dump waste into Lake Erie.

‚ÄúThe land can handle so much waste, and it needs to be farmed appropriately,‚Äù she said.

Mr. Williams believes that the problem lies within municipalities not being held accountable for dumping their wastewater into the lake.

‚ÄúThe solution is not to ban pigs,‚Äù Mr. Williams said. ‚ÄúIt's about how we hold cities accountable for the untreated sewage their dumping into our rivers and lakes.‚Äù

In closing statements, Ms. Larson said that she believes that she is ‚Äúon the side of democracy‚Äù in her positions.

‚ÄúSometimes leaders do what they know is the right thing to do, even if others don‚Äôt yet see it,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúMost of the time though, leaders can and should listen to the will of the people because it's a reliable guide to what will turn out best for all of us. I have the work experience, the wisdom, and the empathy to do this job in that way.‚Äù

Mr. Williams believes that his personal experience makes him a candidate who can bring about unique solutions for the district and the state.

‚ÄúThe solution is not just to have empathy for everyone because of their life experiences,‚Äù he said in his closing statement. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs using your life experience to help guide Ohioans to a better future.‚Äù

523,"In Torre's book he wrote with Tom Verducci, they wrote that the midge incident was the confluence of a bunch of seemingly unrelated events: like the clean up of Lake Erie making it more hospitable to insects, and then pushing the game back to accommodate another event or something like that.  The time of night and the bright lights of the stadium attracted the midges to the playing field.

Edit: I just grabbed my copy of the book

Verducci writes that midges had disappeared from the polluted Lake Erie, but after extensive clean up efforts there and in the Cuyahoga River, they began to return.  Midges only really swarm a few days a year in early May - June, but October 5th 2007 was unusually warm in Cleveland, so that triggered another swarm.  They gathered around the artificial light of the stadium, and descended on the playing field.  The play time of the game was adjusted to accommodate the Red Sox/Angels game, and that ended up putting the 8th inning of Game 2 right smack in the middle of the swarm.

So yeah, environmental cleanup, an 81-degree night in October, and some schedule shuffling landed the Yankees in the middle of a swarm of bugs."

Biggest thing that helped me get the job was my sampling expertise from a job prior. That includes auto sampling work and watershed monitoring.

530,"# Leftist perspective

Leftists want our economy to explicitly serve the people in our society and to be deliberately engineered to improve people's outcomes and freedoms.

Voting Republican will destroy the fragile web of regulations that prevent things from getting much worse fast. For just one example, the EPA was created after unrestrained capitalism regularly set fire to major rivers and Lake Erie. [Trump tried to gut it.](https://theweek.com/articles/816875/how-trump-redefining-epa)

Leftists generally want everyone to have a baseline guaranteed quality of life. Republicans since Reagan [have worked to remove or limit welfare programs.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1984/07/29/reagan-welfare-cuts-found-to-worsen-families-poverty/077278f9-a875-4791-9c34-d1cf3cd148b5/) Welfare programs are no more than gauze on an arterial bleed, but they're better than nothing.

Democrats, however, are often in favor of maintaining, or occasionally improving, these inadequate bandage policies. Voting Democrat is a matter of harm reduction. It's nowhere near all that leftists want to do, but if voting doesn't require obscene amounts of effort, it's pretty effective at slowing the rate of going-to-hell.

However, Democrats cannot be trusted to enact a leftist agenda, or even make a token gesture toward leftism.

# Liberal perspective

Economically, a liberal is someone who supports capitalism. Socially, a liberal is someone who supports people doing what they want with their lives.

From the economic perspective, you might vote Democrat because the businesses you support aren't negatively impacted by current and likely future regulations, at least not more than they're helped. Those who take a broader view of the economy would generally agree that, for instance, forbidding people from dumping used motor oil into the Ohio River is a bit of a burden on those who need to dump used motor oil, but it's more than offset by having the Ohio River not catch fire every year.

You might also vote Democrat because you think a few people temporarily need assistance when they're down on their luck, but most everyone can and should participate in capitalism, and that should be the goal of assistance programs.

You could also vote Democrat because, while you prefer further right economic policies, you are against bigotry and think the government has a place in protecting against it, like with affirmative action ‚Äî or at least that it should abstain from enforcing it, such as with transgender healthcare bans. Or because you believe that people should not be forced to give up their health due to pregnancy and should be able to obtain an abortion.

You might also vote Democrat because the only other viable alternative is a Republican and that Republican is a child rapist or the like. This has happened in some elections. Democrats are generally quick to remove or disavow politicians who have been credibly accused of serious misconduct, but Republicans seem unmoved by such accusations.

# Right-wing perspective

Technically, this is the *further* right wing perspective economically.

You might vote Republican because you view taxes and government programs as an imposition on your freedom. Government, you say, should exist for a minimal set of purposes, and it's taken on a large set of other responsibilities that should instead exist as different kinds of entity. This is an economically libertarian view.

You might also vote Republican because of bigotry. Republicans want to dismantle affirmative action and marriage equality. They support religious organizations being used for things like adoption and supporting homeless people, even when these religious organizations discriminate against people on the basis of religion or sexuality or the like. They have been legislating against transgender rights such as getting gender-affirming healthcare. They're keen on enacting laws to ban single digit numbers of trans children from participating in middle and high school sports. They use openly racist rhetoric, like strongly implying that Mexican immigrants are rapists and murderers.

Or you might like the strong man rhetoric that Republicans use."

569,"The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald
Song by Gordon Lightfoot


The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down
Of the big lake they called Gitche Gumee
The lake, it is said, never gives up her dead
When the skies of November turn gloomy

With a load of iron ore twenty-six thousand tons more
Than the Edmund Fitzgerald weighed empty
That good ship and true was a bone to be chewed
When the gales of November came early

The ship was the pride of the American side
Coming back from some mill in Wisconsin
As the big freighters go, it was bigger than most
With a crew and good captain well seasoned

Concluding some terms with a couple of steel firms
When they left fully loaded for Cleveland
And later that night when the ship's bell rang
Could it be the north wind they'd been feelin'?

The wind in the wires made a tattle-tale sound
And a wave broke over the railing
And every man knew, as the captain did too
T'was the witch of November come stealin'

The dawn came late and the breakfast had to wait
When the gales of November came slashin'
When afternoon came it was freezin' rain
In the face of a hurricane west wind

When suppertime came, the old cook came on deck sayin'
""Fellas, it's too rough to feed ya""
At seven PM, a main hatchway caved in, he said
""Fellas, it's been good to know ya""

The captain wired in he had water comin' in
And the good ship and crew was in peril
And later that night when his lights went outta sight
Came the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald

Does any one know where the love of God goes
When the waves turn the minutes to hours?
The searchers all say they'd have made Whitefish Bay
If they'd put fifteen more miles behind her

They might have split up or they might have capsized
They may have broke deep and took water
And all that remains is the faces and the names
Of the wives and the sons and the daughters

Lake Huron rolls, Superior sings
In the rooms of her ice-water mansion
Old Michigan steams like a young man's dreams
The islands and bays are for sportsmen

And farther below Lake Ontario
Takes in what Lake Erie can send her
And the iron boats go as the mariners all know
With the gales of November remembered

In a musty old hall in Detroit they prayed
In the maritime sailors' cathedral
The church bell chimed 'til it rang twenty-nine times
For each man on the Edmund Fitzgerald

The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down
Of the big lake they called Gitche Gumee
Superior, they said, never gives up her dead
When the gales of November come early"

602,"This is from ohiodnr website:

NUISANCE SPECIES: MUTE SWANS

Mute swans are commonly seen on large public lakes and are widespread throughout Ohio. They are considered a non-native invasive species in the United States and are becoming a nuisance here in Ohio. There are three species of swans that can be found in Ohio: The native trumpeter swan, tundra swan (or whistling swan, which only migrates through Ohio) and the mute swan. Mute swans will outcompete with the threatened trumpeter swan on Lake Erie marshes and other locations for nesting habitat.

During the breeding and nesting season, which generally runs March through May, adult mute swans become highly territorial and will fight to push native birds out of their nesting area. Mute swans have been known to attack humans and pets during this time as well. This aggressive behavior also occurs after the young, called cygnets, hatch out. On public lakes, people who use jet-skis and kayaks tend to get flogged by swans if they get too close to their nest or young. The adult male will fly after what they see as a predator to chase it away and use their wings to attack. They have been known to drown people on rare occasions.   

An adult male swan can weigh up to twenty-six pounds and stand as tall as five feet. Mute swans can consume up to eight pounds of submerged aquatic vegetation in one day. They uproot the whole plant usually leaving nothing behind. This takes away natural habitat from fish and leaves little food source for native waterfowl. The removal of aquatic vegetation can also cause water quality issues and erosion problems. 

The Division of Wildlife controls mute swans on public lands by utilizing egg addling to cut back on production and by physical removal of adult birds. Occasionally, complaints are received from homeowners who surround public lakes when mute swans are being aggressive. Removal of the bird is the action taken when human safety is a factor.  

Contrary to what most people believe, mute swans will nest next to Canada geese. Homeowner associations or golf courses will purchase swans for goose control. Ultimately the swans will eventually become a problem for the homeowners around the ponds because of aggression issues and removal is warranted. We encourage private landowners who chose to have mute swans to keep them controlled. The ways to control them is to only purchase one swan or two of the same sex and keep their wings clipped or pinioned. This will keep the swan on the owner‚Äôs property. Landowners can also addle the eggs so cygnets do not hatch out. If the young are going to be allowed to hatch out, their wings need to be clipped or pinioned as well so they cannot leave the property. Division staff will assist private landowners who ask for removal of mutes by giving technical assistance or removing the swans depending on site-specific circumstances."

Instead all the balloons started coming back down, big shock, no one could have seen this coming! A bunch of them ended up in Lake Erie, where two men had been reported missing that day. The Coast Guard searched for them but with all the balloons in the water it was hard to tell what was a balloon and what was someone‚Äôs head sticking up out of the water, and unfortunately the men were found dead later. The balloon event was overall a disaster!"
615,I was at Lake Erie this summer and some of the beaches were closed because the E Coli from the sewage they dump in there was too high. People WERE STILL IN THE WATER. It was repulsive.
616,"The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down
Of the big lake they called Gitche Gumee
The lake, it is said, never gives up her dead
When the skies of November turn gloomy
With a load of iron ore twenty-six thousand tons more
Than the Edmund Fitzgerald weighed empty
That good ship and true was a bone to be chewed
When the gales of November came early
The ship was the pride of the American side
Coming back from some mill in Wisconsin
As the big freighters go, it was bigger than most
With a crew and good captain well seasoned
Concluding some terms with a couple of steel firms
When they left fully loaded for Cleveland
And later that night when the ship's bell rang
Could it be the north wind they'd been feelin'?
The wind in the wires made a tattle-tale sound
And a wave broke over the railing
And every man knew, as the captain did too
T'was the witch of November come stealin'
The dawn came late and the breakfast had to wait
When the gales of November came slashin'
When afternoon came it was freezin' rain
In the face of a hurricane west wind
When suppertime came, the old cook came on deck sayin'
""Fellas, it's too rough to feed ya""
At seven PM, a main hatchway caved in, he said
""Fellas, it's been good to know ya""
The captain wired in he had water comin' in
And the good ship and crew was in peril
And later that night when his lights went outta sight
Came the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald
Does any one know where the love of God goes
When the waves turn the minutes to hours?
The searchers all say they'd have made Whitefish Bay
If they'd put fifteen more miles behind her
They might have split up or they might have capsized
They may have broke deep and took water
And all that remains is the faces and the names
Of the wives and the sons and the daughters
Lake Huron rolls, Superior sings
In the rooms of her ice-water mansion
Old Michigan steams like a young man's dreams
The islands and bays are for sportsmen
And farther below Lake Ontario
Takes in what Lake Erie can send her
And the iron boats go as the mariners all know
With the gales of November remembered
In a musty old hall in Detroit they prayed
In the maritime sailors' cathedral
The church bell chimed 'til it rang twenty-nine times
For each man on the Edmund Fitzgerald
The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down
Of the big lake they called Gitche Gumee
Superior, they said, never gives up her dead
When the gales of November come early

The wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald"
617,"A fish which date back to the Early Jurassic period, some 174 to 201 million years ago.
Around here 
Early commercial fisherman (pre-1850) perceived lake sturgeon as a nuisance fish because of fishing gear destruction. This led to their wide-spread slaughter.
In Ontario at Amherstburg, the oily fish were stacked like firewood and left to dry. The mummified bodies were burned to heat the boilers of wood-burning steamboats on the Detroit River.
by the late 1900's, 80% of the lake sturgeon were removed from Lake Erie.
Female lake sturgeon spawn once every 4 to 9 years while males spawn every 2 to 7 years.
Sexual maturity in females is reached most often around 24-26 years.
The typical life-span of lake sturgeon is 55 years for males and 80-150 years for females.
As a consequence of interrupted spawning cycles, only 10-20% of adult lake sturgeon within a population are sexually active and spawn during a given season.
 lake sturgeon are: (U.S.) Federally listed as a species of concern; recognized by the American Fisheries Society as threatened in North America; and, listed as Endangered, Threatened, or Special Concern in 19 of 20 states throughout its range."

We're pretty sure that this square she has is a repurposed piece of one of those, because they made a ton of products with the recycled rubber after collecting it all. It's pretty thick rubber, but it's the right flexibility for a balloon.

 &gt;Balloonfest '86 was a 1986 event in Cleveland, Ohio, United States, in which the local chapter of United Way set a world record by releasing almost 1. 5 million balloons. The event took place on September 27, 1986, and was intended to be a harmless fundraising publicity stunt, but the balloons drifted back over the city, Lake Erie, and landed in the surrounding area, causing problems for traffic and a nearby airport. The event also interfered with a United States Coast Guard search for two boaters who were later found drowned.

&gt;I was told not to eat a lot of ocean fish growing up.

Funny thing is at least for like Lake Erie, there's still limits on how many fish you should eat from there in a given time to be safe.  Depends on the type of fish, and what the fish eats.  Perch is okay twice a week, walleye over a week, some fish like catfish and other bottom feeders they recommend no more than once a month or every other month.  And some places, like parts of the Ohio river they still recommend eating zero fish.

Freshwater definitely does not mean safe or safer."

Toledo, Dayton, and possibly even Akron would like to talk to you about your definition of a major city.

But I digress, there‚Äôs lots of big cities in Ohio, aaaaand they all pretty much suck. Cleveland can have a claim to being a pretty dope town with the rock and roll hall of fame and the sports franchises but our ancestors have decided that the health of our state citizens and all the land didn‚Äôt matter and used the watersheds as their industrial toilet. We‚Äôve had a river so polluted it caught on fire. We‚Äôve released the most balloons in the world at one time and basically told the environment a big fuck you and also resulted in at least one death I can remember but it might‚Äôve been more. Nobody wants to swim in Lake Erie and I‚Äôve been told you can‚Äôt eat the fish caught in it. Buuuuut that‚Äôs all I can think of for now as to why I hate that fucking place.

They‚Äôre not wrong, Ohio sucks. Unfortunately Ohio could be pretty fucking cool, had it not been completely ruined by corrupt politics over the last 140 yrs or so.

As for what would be different with Dems in charge? For one, women would have bodily autonomy. For two, LGBTQ folks would be safer from discrimination. We'd have better public transit and the 3C+D train line would be fast tracked. We'd have a more progressive tax system. Cities wouldn't get ignored. We'd prioritize developing our clean energy industries. We'd finally get a constitutional school funding system, which Republicans have refused to do for over two decades. We'd stop diverting money from public schools to charter and religious private schools. Lake Erie and the Ohio River would be cleaner, along with the air we breathe. And municipalities would see a return of their funding that has been cut repeatedly, leading to service cuts across the state at the local level. I could think of a lot more but that's a good start."
711,"If they're in Buffalo, it's Lake Erie, not the ocean. But yea, lake water."
712,Lake Erie is a very shallow lake. High winds cause the bottom to become turbulent and kick up sediment from the lake bottom. Smaller sediment particles become suspended within the water column for a long enough period of time to be conveyed along the Niagara river and over the falls.
713,I was going to guess lake Erie in Niagara. The Lakeshore looks just like this. Pretty crazy
714,"Green energy projects do not generate any significant quantity of electricity whatsoever.  Trivial in fact.

 Case in point, there used to be a coal fired electricity plant on the shores of Lake Erie at Nanticoke.  It generated 4 GIGA Watts of power.  It was commissioned in the mid 70s and shut down by the liberals in 2013 as part of their program to eliminate coal fired plants.  (And it featured state of the art pollution control systems, but yes, it threw CO2 emmisions.)

It was torn down and the land it was built on was covered in solar panels from end to end.  That solar installation generates 44 Mega Watts. When it functions.  Which is almost never.

across the Russian River, and the community of Vacation Beach sits at the foot of
Neeley Hill, directly downslope of proposed timber operations

&gt;Water bodies in the Russian River watershed are listed under the Clean Water Act Section 303(d) (per the 2012 List) due to impairments to water quality by several pollutants

&gt;The entire Russian River watershed is impaired for sediment and temperature. Recent
data show a pathogen impairment throughout the watershed, as well.

&gt;In 2004, the Regional Water Board adopted a Sediment TMDL Implementation Policy
(Resolution Rl-2004-0087), which states that Regional Water Board staff shall
control sediment pollution by using existing permitting and enforcement tools.  The
goals of the Policy are to control sediment waste discharges to impaired water bodies
so that the TMDLs are met, sediment water quality objectives are attained, and
beneficial uses are no longer impaired by sediment.

&gt; Sediment
conditions interact with water in many ways that can affect water temperatures.
Therefore, practices implemented to prevent and minimize elevated sediment
discharges may also help control elevated water temperatures.

&gt;potential discharges of treated wastewater

&gt;During the PHI, RWB staff observed a road fill failure and associated debris slide. The
failure occurred on a permanent road constructed on an ~85% slope above a Class III
watercourse, extending about seven feet into the old road prism and narrowing the road
to less than seven feet in width. The failure is approximately 75 feet wide, 40 feet long
and 4 to 8 feet deep (Fig 1.) Sediment and debris from the failure entered the Class III
watercourse at the foot of the slope,

&gt; All of these sites and other sites throughout the plan area were littered with
trash, some of which may contain toxic substances. RWB staff observed one small (~5
gallon) tank of refrigerant and numerous camping gas tanks. Several of these sites were
situated in the channels of Class II and III watercourses.

&gt;There are two potential issues of concern with respect to
the irrigation lines; one is the potential for impacts to slope stability by removal of trees
on saturated vulnerable ground and the other is impacts to the districts disposal process
if a line is damaged.

&gt;During the first review process, CDFW brought to attention discrepancies in Section II, Item 32(a) of the
THP regarding northern spotted owl protections. The habitat definitions and retention standards
described appeared to be from Attachment B instead of Attachment A, which contains the take
avoidance measures for northern spotted owls in the coast forest district. In the RPF response to first
review, the definitions and retention standards were not corrected, and Attachment B was referenced
near the beginning of Item 32 within the northern spotted owl protections.
CDFW recommends in Section II, Item 32(a), the protection measures for NSO be revised to reflect the
definitions and retention standards for Attachment A, the November 1,2019 revision. Justification: The
take avoidance measures should reference the appropriate ecotype, allowing the review team to
evaluate the proposed measures for NSO take avoidance.

&gt;During the first review process and through a Northern Spotted Owl (NSO) consultation, CDFW brought
to attention concerns with the timing and stations of the NSO surveys that may affect the quality of the
survey data, resulting in a possible false negative finding. The RPF agreed to supplement the survey effort with three additional surveys in 2020 conducted as close as possible to the crepuscular hours and
one additional thorough Stand Search of the THP area. Efforts to obtain NSO survey information from
past THPs on the property were ongoing at the time of the PHI, and the RPF was able to provide eight
years of NSO survey data from a neighboring NTMP during first review. The additional survey efforts
and any past survey data will allow CDFW to make a higher confidence determination regarding take
avoidance


&gt;Page 79, #6 states ‚ÄúFor NSO AC‚Äôs where fledgling status has been determined (either nest failure
or fledglings have left the core area).‚Äù How will you determine that fledglings have left the core
area? This section does not appear to be from the newly revised Attachment A (2019). Should
the 1st sentence instead state ‚ÄúFor any NSO activity center, regardless of current nesting
status:‚Äù? Please review for consistency.

&gt;THP does not appear to address this nest in the protection measures section for osprey.  Additionally, this nest should be included on the operations map.  

&gt;The THP does not include
language defining the dates of the critical period during which no timber operations are
permitted, with few exceptions. Please include language defining the dates of the critical
period for Northern Goshawk.

&gt;‚ÄúA daytime stand search was conducted
within the property and off the property in the vicinity of the SON0076 AC looking for
evidence of NSOs on 25APR18, 22APR19 and 09MAR20, and no NSO‚Äôs were found.‚Äù Were
these stand searches conducted to protocol standards, specifically a thorough survey of
the entire THP area searching for NSO whitewash, pellets, and feathers while
broadcasting vocalizations, listening for responses, and watching for owls silently flying
in? Please provide a map of the search routes along with data forms that include start
and end times and description of the habitat.

728,"And those of us who grew up on the Lake know nothing other than Great Lakes culture.  It would be very strange for me to not see the Lake (or its tributaries) on a regular basis. But we are from where we're from, and there are certain things we take for granted because of it.  Much of our winter weather, for example, is a direct result of Great Lakes meteorology, and it affects the western basin of Lake Erie differently than it does Cleveland-Buffalo."
729,I grew up 15 mins from Lake Erie... this is a vast improvement from 80's and 90's Erie.
730,"How about this

\&gt;  Lake Erie's temperature raised by 1-2F  
\&gt; Thermal inertia prevents freezing over of lake surface  
\&gt; Exposed lake surface provides a perpetual fire-hose of precipitation powered by cyclone bomb event  
\&gt; Rapid warming post storm increases risk of regional flooding."
731,"Also, with places like Buffalo, higher temperatures can result in more snow. Buffalo is right by Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. In the past, much of the lakes would freeze. A frozen lake surface reduced how much water could evaporate into the air and thus reduced precipitation.

With the higher temperatures, though, the lakes don't freeze. This means more water evaporates and more lake effect snow falls."
732,No Lake Erie beaches to park on?
733,"Buffalonian here with some information about this storm.

First off, fuck Trump for using this to score cheap political points. At least 40 people have been discovered to have died due to this storm so far.  

Second, Buffalo sits at the eastern edge of Lake Erie and is right in the path of what's called [a lake-effect snow band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake-effect_snow?wprov=sfla1). 

Long story short, when the cold, dry wind blows across the still relatively warm lake water, water is sucked up into the atmosphere like a sponge. When the wind then blows across the higher elevations in the Buffalo region, the moisture is essentially squeezed out as a metric shit ton of snow. 

Our main respite from lake-effect snow comes in the form of Lake Erie eventually freezing over towards the middle to end of the winter. Since winters are becoming generally milder due to climate change, we're not getting that freezing. 

So not only is Trump generally a moron about most stuff, but he's also wrong about this. Global warming, so to speak, is indeed fuelling these storms, and is going to make them worse."
734,"As a Buffalonian...

Lake Erie not being frozen because of climate change leads to unusual weather events.

When the lake is thawed, the lake effect machine is alive. Once it freezes, we get a lot less precipitation.

This was entirely driven by warm humid air mixing with low pressures and very cold temps. Basically vacuumed the lake into the air and dropped it on Buffalo. The winds made it 10x worse. It ripped my storm door off my house, the latch pulled out of the aluminum door."
735,"Tell me you didn't read either of the articles I just gave you without saying you didn't read either of the articles I just gave you. 

They're in Ontario, just off lake Erie, directly on OP's route from Detroit Metro to LaGuardia."
736,"Plus in the specific case of lake effect from Lake Erie, storms tend to be more frequent and more severe when the lake does not freeze over, since there‚Äôs more moisture due west of cities like Buffalo."
737,And Lake Ontario (being deeper and warmer) never freezes like erie does. Until Lake Erie freezes we could be fucked.
738,"Interesting that people in Michigan are talking about it this way.  I‚Äôm from Ohio, and I hear the Midwest is pretty ‚Äúsafe‚Äù or insulated from climate change effects.  Not sure how true that will turn out to be.  

The Great Lakes are above sea level about 600‚Äô.  And I‚Äôm told the lakes do pretty good at stabilizing temperature.  Of the coastal areas at least.  The he lake effect snow is also a thing, my city is south of Lake Erie so the west to east snow-dump isnt as bad where I am.  I also know that industrial and agricultural pollution has had and is having a huge effect on the lakes.  Both of those things are also drivers of climate change.  So if industry (like automotive) and farming haven‚Äôt changed the global climate far enough to affect the Midwest, I believe the Midwest is also being affected locally as a source. 
That idea might be too out there, but I think there have been more drastic temp changes in recent years.  But even in Ohio people say, ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt like the weather, wait fifteen minutes, it‚Äôll change.‚Äù

I‚Äôm interested in what your research has dug up, because climate deniers don‚Äôt always make make for good insurance appraisers."
739,"Light doesn't reach the bottom of Lake Erie, the shallowest of the great lakes at 200 feet.

So the light thing isn't a great comparison."

741,Lake Erie
742,"Actually the lakes are a lot cleaner than years past. The problem we have is the farmers installing field tile. Which cause rain water to overwhelm the watershed. Then we get our nice toxic algae blooms. At least here on Lake Erie. 

As far as watering the idiots willfully moving to a desert. We have international laws currently in place that keeps the water here in the mid west."
743,"So yeah. No way that‚Äôs floating through the air and sticking to you. If you put your arm into something, idk those particular regulations. But I do contract with the U.S. and Ohio EPAs for environmental stewardship programs in the Lake Erie watershed, so I‚Äôd be happy to make an environmental report if you need a non-employee to make the first move."
744,"It is a dorsal spine from a fish, looks just like the freshwater drum ones I find in Lake Erie. The hole is natural, not carved for use as a tool as others have claimed."
745,Will you tackle the issues of pollution in our waterways head-on by not allowing phosphate companies and sugar cane production to exceed TMDLs in their runoffs?
746,"&gt;**Water Quality Issues**

Definitely this. Should not be underestimated. Those algal blooms in the western end of Lake Erie!"

Hell even this past week there was a fishing tournament while the winds were really nasty. A guy from out of state came down with his fishing kayak and participated. They found his overturned kayak, but still haven't found him. There was also another boat the flipped a few weeks ago. They towed the boat back upside down and lifted it out with a crane upside down. The electronics on the boat were still lit up and working, the lifejackets were clipped to different things on the boat, but the owner wasn't found for a few days, no life jacket.

Of the big lake they called Gitche Gumee
The lake, it is said, never gives up her dead
When the skies of November turn gloomy
With a load of iron ore twenty-six thousand tons more
Than the Edmund Fitzgerald weighed empty
That good ship and true was a bone to be chewed
When the gales of November came early

The ship was the pride of the American side
Coming back from some mill in Wisconsin
As the big freighters go, it was bigger than most
With a crew and good captain well seasoned
Concluding some terms with a couple of steel firms
When they left fully loaded for Cleveland
And later that night when the ship's bell rang
Could it be the north wind they'd been feelin'?

The wind in the wires made a tattle-tale sound
And a wave broke over the railing
And every man knew, as the captain did too
T'was the witch of November come stealin'
The dawn came late and the breakfast had to wait
When the gales of November came slashin'
When afternoon came it was freezin' rain
In the face of a hurricane west wind

When suppertime came, the old cook came on deck sayin'
""Fellas, it's too rough to feed ya""
At seven PM, a main hatchway caved in, he said
""Fellas, it's been good to know ya""
The captain wired in he had water comin' in
And the good ship and crew was in peril
And later that night when his lights went outta sight
Came the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald

Does any one know where the love of God goes
When the waves turn the minutes to hours?
The searchers all say they'd have made Whitefish Bay
If they'd put fifteen more miles behind her
They might have split up or they might have capsized
They may have broke deep and took water
And all that remains is the faces and the names
Of the wives and the sons and the daughters

Lake Huron rolls, Superior sings
In the rooms of her ice-water mansion
Old Michigan steams like a young man's dreams
The islands and bays are for sportsmen
And farther below Lake Ontario
Takes in what Lake Erie can send her
And the iron boats go as the mariners all know
With the gales of November remembered

In a musty old hall in Detroit they prayed
In the maritime sailors' cathedral
The church bell chimed 'til it rang twenty-nine times
For each man on the Edmund Fitzgerald
The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down
Of the big lake they called Gitche Gumee
Superior, they said, never gives up her dead
When the gales of November come early"

On July 22, 1796, Moses Cleaveland arrived at the mouth of the Cuyahoga   
River and decided that the land just to the east of it would be the   
capital of the new territory. His surveyors laid out a town, including a  
 9-1/2-acre Public Square, on the high bluffs overlooking Lake Erie and   
the winding Cuyahoga. Cleaveland and most of his men returned to   
Connecticut in October, having laid out towns and plots all across the   
territory east of the Cuyahoga River.

The only thing left of it is the arched entrance way now however. The rest was dumped in lake erie (this was before a lot of current environmental laws).

829,"‚ÄúTypically, a helium-filled latex balloon that is released outdoors will stay aloft long enough to be fully deflated before it descends to Earth.[8] However, the Balloonfest balloons collided with a front of cool air and rain, which caused them to drop towards the ground while still inflated. The descending balloons clogged the land and waterways of Northeast Ohio. In the days following the event, many balloons were reported washed ashore on the Canadian side of Lake Erie causing water pollution.[6] Some people had misconceptions about the environmental impact of balloon releases, thinking that ""the balloons would reach an altitude where they popped and disintegrated.""[7]. 
  
  Burke Lakefront Airport had to shut down a runway for half an hour after balloons landed there.[1][3] Traffic collisions were also reported ""as drivers swerved to avoid slow motion blizzards of multicolored orbs or took their eyes off the road to gawk at the overhead spectacle"".[3] Motorists on the Cleveland Memorial Shoreway ran into fences and each other before the roadway was shut down. A bulldozer was needed to help clear away the balloons.[7]. 
  
  Two fishermen, Raymond Broderick and Bernard Sulzer, who had gone out on September 26, were reported missing by their families on the day of the event. Rescuers spotted their 16-foot (4.9 m) boat anchored west of the Edgewater Park breakwall.

836,"‚ÄúTypically, a helium-filled latex balloon that is released outdoors will stay aloft long enough to be fully deflated before it descends to Earth.[8] However, the Balloonfest balloons collided with a front of cool air and rain, which caused them to drop towards the ground while still inflated. The descending balloons clogged the land and waterways of Northeast Ohio. In the days following the event, many balloons were reported washed ashore on the Canadian side of Lake Erie causing water pollution.[6] Some people had misconceptions about the environmental impact of balloon releases, thinking that ""the balloons would reach an altitude where they popped and disintegrated.""[7].

Burke Lakefront Airport had to shut down a runway for half an hour after balloons landed there.[1][3] Traffic collisions were also reported ""as drivers swerved to avoid slow motion blizzards of multicolored orbs or took their eyes off the road to gawk at the overhead spectacle"".[3] Motorists on the Cleveland Memorial Shoreway ran into fences and each other before the roadway was shut down. A bulldozer was needed to help clear away the balloons.[7].

Two fishermen, Raymond Broderick and Bernard Sulzer, who had gone out on September 26, were reported missing by their families on the day of the event. Rescuers spotted their 16-foot (4.9 m) boat anchored west of the Edgewater Park breakwall.

Between living in CNY and living here, Lake Ontario would continue to dump lake effect snow throughout the winter as it never freezes and is much deeper. It  was a blessing if Lane Erie froze, because that essentially turns off the snow machine for WNY. Lake Erie hasn't frozen in a long time now, and summers are getting hotter, so I imagine the water also stays warm longer."

849,"The problem is there are too many products to continually research. I don't want to have to background check the ethical practices of every company that I purchase anything from. And neither does anybody else.

Economic conservatives continually make the same mistake - they focus on individual behavior as if telling everyone to be better can solve any of these problems. It can't. In a global economy, individual consumers have no power to force changes on companies through their purchasing decisions.

The reason regulations exist is because it's simply not possible with the limited time that we all have to keep companies honest, and to expect that the honest ones are going to have any sort of advantage in a marketplace that is too overflowing with information and misinformation for the consumer to make informed decisions on every good they purchase.

Ultimately, whether or not I shop at Amazon makes zero difference towards the company's bottom line. Everybody else knows the same thing, and so in the aggregate there's no way to change them. We know this, because the fact that individuals will act in their own self-interest is a foundational principle of free market economics.

Regulations allow both businesses and consumers to make better ethnical choices. Again, we know this is true based on generations of empirical evidence - just look at Lake Erie, and the impact that EPA regulations had on it even within a 20-year time span starting in the '70s.

We don't breathe smog-filled air because of pollution controls. The hole in the ozone layer is gone because of CFC regulations. Kids aren't eating leaded paint chips or breathing leaded gasoline fumes, because of lead regulations. Vehicle fatalities have dropped tremendously since the 1970s because of vehicle safety regulations.

The idea that the market freedoms allow for the best possible results for society is nothing more than pure brainwashing propaganda by pro-business forces. Does it make for a slightly more efficient economy? Perhaps. But that's not worth the health, safety, and happiness trade-offs that come with it."

856,"The EPA [disagrees](https://www.epa.gov/greatlakes/lake-erie).

&gt;Of all the Great Lakes, Lake Erie is exposed to the greatest stress from urbanization, industrialization and agriculture. Lake Erie surpasses all the other Great Lakes in the amount of effluent received from sewage treatment plants and is also most subjected to sediment loading due to the nature of the underlying geology and land use. Exposed agricultural and urban lands, particularly in southwest Ontario and northwest Ohio, contribute immense sediment loads to the lake.

In particular, one of the worst sources of the phosphorus that feeds the toxic algae is the [Maumee river watershed](https://news.umich.edu/lake-erie-phosphorus-reduction-targets-challenging-but-achievable/).

&gt;The main driver of the harmful algal blooms is elevated phosphorus from watersheds draining to Lake Erie‚Äôs western basin, particularly from the heavily agricultural Maumee River watershed. About 85 percent of the phosphorus entering Lake Erie from the Maumee River comes from farm fertilizers and manure."

If we can keep restoring the health of Lake Erie, Ohio's proximity to this source of fresh water will be a benefit.

As climate change spurs mass human migrations, you will slowly see the value of land in Ohio climb, especially in the north, near the lake.

In the meantime, it's still going to be dicey. The old rust belt towns of Youngstown, Cleveland and Toledo have huge problems.

The Environmental Law &amp; Policy Center is fully funded by private foundations and individuals - no fossil-fuel money and no government grants. Why no government grants? Because we're not afraid to sue the federal government (or state governments) when it means doing the right thing. Here is some of the work I'm most proud of from 2022:
  
1) We successfully sued the Federal EPA and Ohio EPA in a landmark case to reduce agricultural runoff pollution ‚Äì fertilizer and manure ‚Äì into the Maumee River Watershed which flows into Lake Erie, causing harmful algae blooms. Algae blooms from corporate agriculture threaten all 5 Great Lakes. Read more here: https://elpc.org/.../elpc-lucas-county-board-of.../
  
2) We successfully sued the Cleveland Cliffs steel mill in Northwest Indiana for a devastating cyanide and ammonia spill in August 2019 that killed thousands of fish and closed Lake Michigan beaches. The steel mill discharges into the east branch of the Little Calumet River, which flows directly into Lake Michigan. Read more here: https://elpc.org/.../cleveland-cliffs-consent-decree.../
  
3) ELPC‚Äôs new Rising Waters Report identifies twelve areas along the Lake Michigan shoreline where high lake levels and strong storms could impact industrial facilities, contaminated sites, and residential communities. We‚Äôre working with federal, state, and local policymakers to make the investments and policy shifts that will protect Lake Michigan drinking water. Read more here: https://elpc.org/.../rising-waters-climate-change.../
  
4) Our Keep The UP Wild campaign is working to create over 50,000 acres of new Federal Wilderness in the Ottawa National Forest in MI. https://www.keeptheupwild.com/ We have a similar project (no seto create 12,000 acres of new Federal Wilderness in Shawnee National Forest in Southern IL.

Also to be fair since the metro parks took over the lakefront it has DRASTICALLY been improved, and continues to get better.

916,"To my memory, it wasn't that the balloons directly killed anyone through release or anything. As the balloon launch happened, two fishermen were reported missing on Lake Erie. As the balloons landed in the lake (by the tens of thousands,) they made rescue efforts pretty much impossible. Rescuers were looking for either life vests or heads bobbing on the surface.

929,"In that what both of us are describing are political action sanctioned by our political system, sure, which is a really general concept. I was talking about, say, 60% of the electorate all voting for politicians who then enact laws which require corporations to take drastic steps to address each corporation's contribution to environmental damage and crises, as well as hold said politicians accountable to enact these laws lest they are replaced at the next election, as well as enact policies which actively and effectively enforce said laws against corporations.

It sounds like a tall order, but hey, it'll do a better job of reducing ecological harm than me walking to the store and using my own bag for groceries I can't grow at home (and they're not mutually exclusive). I mean, Lake Erie hasn't caught on fire for decades and bald eagle populations have rebounded, I'm pretty sure that didn't happen because a few Americans were more conscious about their shopping habits."

And the Great Black Swamp being drained comolety gone.  The whole N.E Ohio was swamp.  Noe it is gone and Lake Erie is going to die.  Insread of run off being filtered naturaly in swamo it goes straight into river.  That is why there are toxic algae blooms.  All the waste would normally grow trees, but now it is in the Lake.  That is why all the rivers are muddy.  Drain tile.  Farm runnoff going in river.  We are losing tons of soil to this   Niagara Falls gets receads naturally too.  The farther back that goes the lower the water becomes, but the biggest thing is all this swamp and forest being cleared for farmers and pumping ground water.  It causes a chain reaction that leads to less water."

948,"Ohio has really tried to regulate phosphorus due to algae blooms in Lake Erie tied to run off in western Ohio, primarily from farms. The only fertilizer sold at the big box stores is all phosphorus free unless you get starter. Almost everything I read about raising it says the majority of lawns don‚Äôt need it unless it‚Äôs really low, which I think mine is. Landscape supply stores have some that are 2-3% phosphorus but it‚Äôs difficult trying to add 40lbs a year.

If you are interested in the situation here are some snippets for this article: https://www.greatlakesnow.org/2020/09/drinking-unsafe-water-contaminants-solutions/ 

""Seth Siegel, author of Troubled Water: What‚Äôs Wrong With What We Drink, underscores the evolution over time in contamination concerns, from the biological to the chemical. ‚ÄúA dab of chlorine might address microorganisms, but it does nothing about these synthetics,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWe are ingesting, in micro quantities, a cocktail of chemicals all the time.‚Äù


The Clean Water Act, in theory, regulates discharges into U.S. waters and therefore protects sources of drinking water. However, this year the Trump administration issued a new regulation, the Navigable Waters Protection Rule, that narrows the scope of the Clean Water Act by revoking federal protections for millions of miles of streams and millions of acres of wetlands. The NRDC and other environmental groups have filed a lawsuit to stop the decision.

‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt have a strong Clean Water Act, we‚Äôll never have clean drinking water,‚Äù says Lynn Thorp, national campaigns director for the nonprofit Clean Water Action. ‚ÄúWe need to put equal effort upstream.‚Äù



Outdated standards
Even when the law is enforced, advocates lament that the standards used are often outdated. The current federal drinking water standard for nitrate, for example, went into effect in 1992 at 10 parts per million. Yet research has found that levels less than one-tenth of that legal limit may raise the risk of cancer and other health issues. In early 2019, the EPA suspended plans to reevaluate the nitrate standard.

The EPA did propose an update in October 2019 to its rules on lead and copper, which had not been touched since 1991. Meanwhile, the House of Representatives approved new legislation this past July that authorizes US$22.5 billion to replace a portion of the country‚Äôs estimated 6 to 10 million lead service lines that remain, connecting water mains to homes in Flint, Newark and elsewhere. Kail says that AWWA supports the revision. ‚ÄúAs long as there is lead in contact with the water, some level of risk remains,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúSo the best cure is to get the lead out.‚Äù

Advocates argue the rules still won‚Äôt go far enough or come fast enough. And they suggest the same generally holds for the EPA‚Äôs actions or inactions on drinking water quality. Of most concern, they say, are the potentially hazardous contaminants that still lack a standard. ‚ÄúThe law really is broken and needs to be fixed if it is going to protect the public,‚Äù says Olson.

The EPA‚Äôs current process for developing new standards, defined in the 1996 amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act, needs to be sped up and strengthened, he and other advocates say. The EPA‚Äôs Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule (UCMR) allows the EPA to select up to 30 unregulated pathogens and pollutants to be monitored every five years. Public drinking water systems serving at least 10,000 people, along with a representative sample of smaller systems, must periodically test for these contaminants. The agency uses the data in considering future drinking water standards.

So far, the only new chemical that the agency has come close to regulating through the process is perchlorate, a component of rocket fuel, munitions and fireworks. Studies suggest that exposure may derail brain development of fetuses and infants. The EPA determined in 2011 that the contaminant required regulation. But this June, the agency reversed course and announced that, taking into consideration ‚Äúthe best available science and the proactive steps that EPA, states and public water systems have taken to reduce perchlorate levels,‚Äù it would not regulate perchlorate. That decision is now in litigation. ‚ÄúThe EPA just hasn‚Äôt had the spine to issue any regulations off the contaminant candidate list,‚Äù says Olson.

Six perfluorinated chemicals were monitored via the UCMR between 2013 and 2015. This past February, the EPA announced preliminary regulatory determinations and opened up comments for two of those chemicals, PFOA and PFOS. Meanwhile, several states, including New Jersey and New Hampshire, have moved ahead with their own regulations, some of which go beyond PFOA and PFOS ‚Äî the legacy PFAS compounds that are already being phased out ‚Äî to include more of the potentially thousands of extremely persistent synthetic chemicals that belong to the same class.


Pathogens and pesticides
Pathogens remain a serious issue, too. E. coli in drinking water has caused deadly outbreaks. Norovirus, Giardia and cryptosporidium have also contaminated drinking water supplies in recent years. But the pathogens perhaps highest on the minds of experts today are those that grow in pipes.

Legionella, the bacterium that causes Legionnaires‚Äô disease, a type of pneumonia, offers a critical case in point. It poses a microbiological threat with widespread consequences. In Flint, the same issue that caused the release of lead into the drinking water also resulted in deadly cases of Legionnaires‚Äô disease in the surrounding community. Repeated outbreaks at a Quincy, Illinois, veterans home have killed more than a dozen people since 2015. And, in May 2019, a custodian died from Legionnaires‚Äô disease after being infected at Kettering Fairmont High School in Kettering, Ohio. The school‚Äôs water tested positive for Legionella this July, and a current custodian has tested positive for the disease. Spokespeople with the Illinois veterans home and the Ohio high school note that measures have been taken to reduce the risk of further infections.

Agricultural practices remain implicated in much of the nation‚Äôs tainted drinking water. Studies have shown that pesticides pose a serious threat. For example, atrazine has been associated with low birth weight in babies.

‚ÄúEvery spring in the Midwest, a pulse of atrazine comes off the fields. Tough luck on you if you happen to be carrying a child during that period,‚Äù says Sedlak, noting that regulatory standards might still be met because EPA regulations average numbers over the course of an entire year.

Neonicotinoids are another example. ‚ÄúNeonics are wonderful [from a human health perspective] because they target receptors specific to insects,‚Äù Sedlak says. ‚ÄúBut, after a chemical reaction with chlorine, the product is something that is likely to target people.‚Äù Limited data hints at potential health effects ranging from respiratory, cardiovascular and neurological issues to birth defects.

Excess fertilizer applications on farms also trigger major algal blooms that can contaminate drinking water. Toxins produced by blue-green algae (also known as cyanobacteria) in Lake Erie fed by runoff from farms in the watershed contaminated the Toledo, Ohio, drinking water system in the summer of 2014. Almost half a million people were told to avoid drinking, bathing or cooking with their tap water for a couple of days; 110 people got sick. It was neither the first nor the last time that such toxins threatened public health. Residents of Carroll Township, Ohio, received a similar warning in September 2013. And in July 2018, authorities in Salem, Oregon, advised children and the elderly not to drink the city‚Äôs water."

Of the big lake they called Gitche Gumee
The lake, it is said, never gives up her dead
When the skies of November turn gloomy
With a load of iron ore twenty-six thousand tons more
Than the Edmund Fitzgerald weighed empty
That good ship and true was a bone to be chewed
When the gales of November came early
The ship was the pride of the American side
Coming back from some mill in Wisconsin
As the big freighters go, it was bigger than most
With a crew and good captain well seasoned
Concluding some terms with a couple of steel firms
When they left fully loaded for Cleveland
And later that night when the ship's bell rang
Could it be the north wind they'd been feelin'?
The wind in the wires made a tattle-tale sound
And a wave broke over the railing
And every man knew, as the captain did too
T'was the witch of November come stealin'
The dawn came late and the breakfast had to wait
When the gales of November came slashin'
When afternoon came it was freezin' rain
In the face of a hurricane west wind
When suppertime came, the old cook came on deck sayin'
""Fellas, it's too rough to feed ya""
At seven PM, a main hatchway caved in, he said
""Fellas, it's been good to know ya""
The captain wired in he had water comin' in
And the good ship and crew was in peril
And later that night when his lights went outta sight
Came the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald
Does any one know where the love of God goes
When the waves turn the minutes to hours?
The searchers all say they'd have made Whitefish Bay
If they'd put fifteen more miles behind her
They might have split up or they might have capsized
They may have broke deep and took water
And all that remains is the faces and the names
Of the wives and the sons and the daughters
Lake Huron rolls, Superior sings
In the rooms of her ice-water mansion
Old Michigan steams like a young man's dreams
The islands and bays are for sportsmen
And farther below Lake Ontario
Takes in what Lake Erie can send her
And the iron boats go as the mariners all know
With the gales of November remembered
In a musty old hall in Detroit they prayed
In the maritime sailors' cathedral
The church bell chimed 'til it rang twenty-nine times

1028,"Local news opinion piece listing some information about reasons to be concerned about shellfish following cyanobacteria blooms


https://saultonline.com/2021/08/viewpoint-sault-ste-marie-blue-green-algae-and-new-brunswick-neurological-desease/

One neurotoxin is BMAA (beta methylamino-L-alanine) which is linked to increased risk of developing ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or Lou Gehrig disease), a catastrophic and uniformly fatal neurodegenerative disease.

Clusters of ALS have been reported around lakes and areas of oceans with blue-green algae blooms.

Researchers at Dartmouth Medical Center have identified ALS hot spots in lake and coastal communities with toxic blooms of blue-green algae in New England, a large one in Vermont near Lake Champlain and a smattering of smaller ones among coastal communities in New Hampshire and Maine.

There is a blue-green algae bloom at the western end of Lake Erie that has grown to cover 620 square miles.

A Cleveland Clinic neurologist has plotted a mega-cluster of over 1,000 cases of ALS in the northwest corner of Ohio, near the western shore of Lake Erie.

Researchers strongly suspect that fish and shellfish from waters contaminated with cyanobacteria blooms may be one way that people ingest BMAA.

In southern France, researchers suspect ALS cases may be linked to consumption of mussels and oysters.

Lobsters, collected off the Florida coast near blooms, also have been found with high levels of BMAA.

Three sporadic ALS patients lived in Annapolis, Maryland, and developed the disease within a relatively short time and within close proximity to each other.

The common factor among them was the frequent consumption of blue crab which were found to have high levels of BMAA.

Investigators concluded that the presence of BMAA in the Chesapeake Bay food web and the lifetime consumption of blue crab contaminated with BMAA probably led to these cases of ALS.

The indigenous Chamorro people on the South Pacific island of Guam have a diet that has one of the highest levels of BMAA in the world.

They are afflicted by a devastating fatal neurodegenerative illness dubbed amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ‚Äì Parkinsonism/dementia complex (ALS-PDC) at a rate that is 100 times the incidence of ALS world-wide"

1030,"I‚Äôm from Michigan and I‚Äôll write a short list of why we hate Ohio: 
1. The fertilizer runoff from their never-ending swaths of farmland flows into Lake Erie and causes massive toxic algal blooms. 
2. Those same never-ending farmlands become mind-numbing any time you have to drive through the state. It takes approximately five hours to go straight through north ‚Äî&gt; south, but it feels like days because it‚Äôs so *boring*. Oh, and you thought you were almost there? Just kidding, here‚Äôs some never-ending unnecessary construction that‚Äôll send you on a half hour detour and get you all kinds of turned around, just to add to the misery.
3. Speaking of driving through, we‚Äôre notorious for speeding in MI: if the speed limit says 70 mph, you better be doing at least 78 or your ass is gonna get tailgated. But Ohio? Don‚Äôt even THINK about it. As soon as you cross the border, there is ALWAYS a cop waiting to catch people going 2-3 mph over. Best keep it at a cool 65, lest you face the wrath of the boys in blue. And 65mph for *five fucking hours* makes the drive feel even *longer*. 
4. More driving stuff: be prepared to spend up to $15-20 USD as you drive because Ohio has TOLLS. We Michiganders don‚Äôt believe in the concept. And yes, our roads suck. But we‚Äôre proud of them anyways because we already pay for them with our hard-earned tax dollars, dammit! Never mind having to pay EXTRA for roads you‚Äôve already paid for! Also, is there really any good way to make sure that your check engine light still works other than clobbering a good ol‚Äô Michigan pothole? 
5. Ohio State University vs Michigan State University and/or University of Michigan. Never has a greater rivalry festered, and never has there been one more bitter. Wear a Buckeyes jersey in our state at your own risk. 
6. Ohio would love to be as innovative and world-changing as Michigan. Yeah, sure, whatever, a whole bunch of astronauts and pilots were born there. Y‚Äôknow how those guys got to NASA or their flight schools? By driving in CARS. Y‚Äôknow where the most automobiles came from soon after they were invented? Michigan, and more specifically, Detroit. The moon is cool and all I guess, but cars permanently changed the entire world. 
7. The Toledo War: before Michigan was a state, Ohio had the audacity to try and lay claim to a section of the Michigan Territory. After a bitter (but bloodless) dispute, Ohio got the Toledo Strip. We‚Äôve never forgotten it. Now, we did end up getting the better deal because we wound up with the Upper Peninsula i.e. thousands of acres of beautiful forest, copper and iron mines that boosted our early economy, and access to Lake Superior. But still. The absolute *unmitigated gall*.
8. Ohio thinks they have bragging rights because seven US presidents were from there. But y‚Äôknow what? They were all *the most forgettable* presidents ever.

1033,"I live within sight of Lake Erie and it's become a serious problem here. 

Runoff from farmers fields mixed with warmer Temps make us check algae levels before we do anything on the water."
1034,"An anecdotal example, but agricultural runoff is what's causing algae blooms in Lake Erie, making the water sometimes unsafe to drink.  The runoff comes from pig farms in Michigan which liquify the pig waste and spray it on crops in the Maumee basin.  Because the area was a drained swamp, the land is covered with clay irrigation pipes which drain the liquid from the land and feed it right into the river with no natural filtering in the soil.  The river then dumps the phosphorous and nitrogen into the lake.  Many of these farms are growing the subsidized animal feed that goes back to those pig farms.  

Nobody wants to do anything about it because we've deified the farmer as some humble symbol of Americana, when in reality these farms are almost all owned by corporations."

1052,"Excessive levels of total P and N will lead to eutrophication and hypoxia. 

Your first article just says the fishermen think the waters are too clean which is hindering their catch. Which is incorrect and opinion based 

In the 20th century the lake was bombarded by intensified agriculture runoff and industrial wastewater pollution which resulted in eutrophication and the formation of the international commission for the protection of Lake Constance. Since then, they put stricter standards on the industrial and agricultural sector. 

In short: the lake went through a phase of eutrophication caused by industry wastewater and agricultural runoff which depleted aquatic species and dissolved oxygen.

An international effort to address the problem resulted in more strict standards of discharge leading to a phase of of oligotrophication (reverse of eutrophication).

Oligotrophication is the dip in nutrients as the system tries to reach a stable level. Here is where you‚Äôll see the absence of aquatic life or ‚Äúclean water.‚Äù

By no means is agricultural runoff and excess nutrients okay. There are safe limits according to TMDLs and the Clean Water Act (in the U.S.). But disrupting natural nutrient cycles with an artificial effluent will alter the system. 

I just wanted to bring this to awareness so that members of this sub don‚Äôt go around dumping P and N in their streams.

Again, we ship drinking water around the world in plastic bottles, so that completely defeats your argument about shipping drinking water a thousand miles to California. We already do. In high cost small units.

Desalination via membrane presents all kinds of problems of it's own. California already has limited desalination and it's not cheap and it's no panacea. If it were the holy grail, water scarcity wouldn't be a global issue.

Water in Canada - 60% of our water drains north. Much of that could be diverted south (except for laws preventing it). Great Lakes, Lake Winnipeg, Lake Manitoba, etc. 

The Trans Mountain Pipeline runs from Alberta to British Columbia - through the mountains. The Trans Canada Pipeline runs across the country.

1109,"From the article:

&gt;**Early last year, the state of Wisconsin issued a fish consumption advisory that recommended eating no more than one meal a month of Lake Superior rainbow smelt, caught by tribes and local anglers during smelt runs in the spring**. It was the first advisory for any of the Great Lakes warning of fish with elevated levels of PFAS.  
&gt;  
&gt;PFAS are known as ‚Äúforever chemicals‚Äù because they don‚Äôt break down in the environment. After years of industrial use, the federal government recently took steps to regulate them. **But will it be enough to assure the safety of the Indigenous people who have fished on the lake for thousands of years ‚Äî and depend on the fish for survival?**

PFAS forever chemicals affect EVERYONE!  Most NDNs in my tribe, including myself, regularly go fishing &amp; depend on fish for food from our rivers &amp; lakes.  Friday Fish Frys are a cherished tradition in Wisconsin, among Natives &amp; Non-Natives alike.

This news article is distressing to me; I'm sorry this is happening.  When I was younger, after we got back our Rez lands, I felt like we could close ourselves off (from an environmental perspective) from the dominant society destructive ways then we'd be okay.  This was around the time when Lake Erie had caught on fire.  I thought if we followed our traditional ways, then that was what mattered &amp; we'd survive.

Then came Acid Rain.  I realized dominant society's pollution rained on us, too.  We could be doing the right thing, but we're indirectly affected by others.  We're all in this together.  We need to work together to stop destroying our planet!  I still have hope."

1120,"Oh, I have no doubt that they have the water secured. It just ain‚Äôt coming 200ish miles down here in a pipeline out of Lake Erie. Also, I imagine in this era that there is going to be at least some extent of water treatment and recycling involved. This plant should ideally be a model for others to come during this century."
1121,I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs drastic because there‚Äôs more than a handful of ponds that I used to fish in as a kid up until about middle school in 2010-2012 that today are completely dead suffocated by algae everywhere. Those deadly algae blooms you hear about on Lake Erie don‚Äôt just go to the lake. That agriculture run off turns once beautiful pristine ponds into pools of thick green stinky muck. I‚Äôd say the changes have been happening all this time but it‚Äôs now that we‚Äôre really starting to deal with the negative effects.

Public outcry during this time birthed the clean water act. Dr. Suess eventually changed the wording in the book at the request of some students from the Ohio Sea Grant Education Program once things had began to change for the better in Lake Erie but in his return letter he wrote-

""I can assure you the process of purifying my text will comemce immediately. Unfortunately, the purification of texts, like that of the lakes, cannot be accomplished overnight. The objectionable line will be removed from future editions. But it could be more then a year before the existing stock of books has moved out of the book stores."" 

For someone who grew up on the great lakes and has learned much about their troubling history this story has always held a place close to me. The clean water act is an essential part of holding people and corporations accountable and protecting some of our most valuable resources. 

""Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. Its not."""
1136,Cheers brother! I can see where it can have an effect on small farms but with education and better farming practices its not very difficult to overcome the small hurdles. We still deal with massive issues like algae blooms in Lake Erie that are due to farms in Ohio overusing fertilizers and not using them at the proper time of the year. But again with the proper regulations and education this isint a difficult issue to overcome. Its much harder to push back on big corporations that have put refineries on our shores and are constantly being fined for toxic discharge into the lakes. Like most things this comes back to money in politics. Its hard to do what's right when those in charge are getting paid to stay silent. The best we can do is spread awareness and get us back to the point where the public demands the change.

1166,"This is exactly what Lake Erie needs! I'll try to explain.

Climate change has resulted in much less lake ice forming over Lake Erie. The ice that forms between the beach and the open water acts as a barricade against erosion. Erosion which would be caused by the waves crashing against the beaches, swallowing up the sand and the fragile, endangered dune ecosystems. 

No lake ice during the winter = waves swallowing up the beaches and causing erosion (bad)

More lake ice = much less Lake Erie shoreline being swallowed up by the lake each winter (good!)"
1167,"The biggest swimming pool, per thirty seconds' ~~googl~~duck-duck-going, is a little under a hundred thousand square meters; it's out at a resort in Egypt, and it's one of a dozen pools at the site.

All twelve of those very large (saltwater) swimming pools taken together have a surface area of roughly a million square meters, which is about the size of a single square kilometer.

The also-ran-lake, Lake Champlain, over just past the far end of New York state from Lake Erie, which was far too *small* to qualify for membership in the Great Lakes, has a surface area that is well over a thousand times the size of those twelve pools put together, at a little over 1,200 km^2 , depending on the water level.

The actual Great Lakes start at well over ten times *that* big.

1170,"In the territory that once was the Empire of Atu'apol lies a planet by the name of Ska'i 2. It was once a huge industrial hub for Atu'apol, with countless factories and chemical refineries run by a population of 500 million.

So naturally, Ska'i 2 would make the perfect target in a war, and that's what happened.

The Great Atu'apol War came, and Ska'i 2 was designated a high value target once the Kor-Vosh Empire and the ATU went on the offensive. Kor-Vosh forces attacked the planet with thousands of nuclear weapons and neutron bombs. Nothing was to survive the assault, by order of the High Command of the Imperial Armada.

Indeed, nothing did survive. No buildings were left intact, all 500 million Atu'apol citizens were killed, and what was left behind was a nuclear and chemical wasteland.

Today, radiation levels are still too high on Ska'i 2 for anyone to visit, outside of professionals in maximum-protection hazmat suits. Chemicals from the refineries are still concentrated to dangerous levels in many spots on the planet's surface, coming in the form of contaminated water and soil. These concentrations prevent flora from growing in large swaths of Ska'i 2's surface, though areas with lower concentrations show sporadic plant growth. The rain is frequently acidic or otherwise laced with various toxins, forcing the surviving flora to evolve natural defenses. Fauna is almost nonexistent, with the largest animals still alive being no larger than a rat.

The planet's atmosphere has also been altered by the release of toxic chemicals. Aerosols are trapping more heat than the planet could handle, causing any large bodies of water to evaporate. However, aerosol concentrations are slowly dropping, and the planet's average temperatures along with them, so some bodies of water are making a comeback.

If you were to look at Ska'i 2 from low orbit, you would see its surface as a patchwork of mostly grays and browns, but with splotches of green and blue where plants and water have emerged. Remains of cities and other infrastructure is also visible from space, which look like differences in the surface's texture, and is accompanied by the craters and scorch marks from the nuclear blasts.

Should you be brave enough to land on Ska'i 2 with a hazmat suit, there isn't a lot to look at besides the city ruins. Every single building is at least partially collapsed, and you would probably see a haze. That haze is not smoke or smog, but clouds of chemicals evaporating from the soil, so DO NOT TAKE OFF YOUR HELMET! Outside of the ruins, you would find a whole lot of barren rock and soil, with plant remains strewn about. The bodies of water come in the form of rivers and lakes, with the largest lake being the size of Lake Erie. Surrounding the lakes and rivers are the remaining flora, mostly grasses and hardy bushes. Don't expect to see any animals - the animal population is very low and they spend most of their days in burrows.

Scientists estimate that it would take 25,000 years for the radiation and chemical concentrations to dissipate enough to be considered safe for people to walk on the planet's surface without a protective suit or breathing apparatus."

1210,"To some degree. The earth filters out some, what's left is handled by nature just at a slower pace. Drinking water facilities would handle the rest before sending it into our infrastructure. Rinse and repeat. 

Issues arise when receiving waters are overloaded quicker than their natural ability to regulate (agricultural runoff into Lake Erie) and the slow buildup of residual nutrients. Though not a nutrient, the industry is seeing this effect with prescription drugs slowly building up due to lack of ability to treat them.

Edit: For clarity, wastewater is heavily regulated before being used for irrigation. It is no longer sewage, but fairly clean water. Runoff from fertilizers, etc is the primary source of concern."
1211,"Agree, Toledo has a wonderful art museum. Great Mexican restaurants there due to migrant farm workers deciding to drop out of the migrant steam and stay.

1248,"My bad. The Rouge (which flows directly into the Detroit River, where the fire was) and the Cuyahoga (which, after leaving a beautiful national park, flows directly into Lake Erie, where the fire was) burned during that era. The point being surface water quality in 1970 was fucked, compared to today. 

Saying it is bad today because it was horrific pre-EPA and pre Clean Water Act is like saying you can't build between 7 Mile and 11 Mile along Woodward, because it is swampland."
1249,"That‚Äôs incredibly recent given that we‚Äôre talking about a river catching on fire. Sure, it‚Äôs not *flammable* now, but it‚Äôs hardly a clean river. 

https://cen.acs.org/environment/pollution/Marking-50-years-since-Cuyahoga/97/i24

&gt;Despite these and other cleanup efforts over the past 50 years, the Cuyahoga is still considered an environmentally degraded waterway. Some 75 km of the Cuyahoga River upstream from Lake Erie is deemed one of 43 environmental ‚Äúareas of concern‚Äù under the US-Canada Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. These areas are considered impaired by pollution or other environmental problems in their ability to support aquatic life or beneficial use by people, such as fishing or maintaining a navigation channel.
&gt;According to the EPA, the Cuyahoga remains impaired in a number of ways. The river‚Äôs fish population is degraded, some fish have tumors or other deformities, and the finned swimmers have lost habitat. The river‚Äôs channel has a set of problems too. Populations of organisms that dwell in the Cuyahoga‚Äôs muddy bottom are dwindling. Dredging of the channel to improve navigation is restricted because sediments are contaminated. And water quality remains problematic. The river is prone to algal blooms, and the pollution the Cuyahoga carries into Lake Erie regularly leads to beach closures along the lakefront."

1252,"There‚Äôs a small town near me, on the Lake Erie coastline, where, when the mayflies get thick, they occasionally have to use the snowplows to clear them from the street. If they‚Äôre quite thick, you‚Äôll slide on them when you‚Äôre coming into town like it‚Äôs ice. It‚Äôs quite gross.

1255,"Mayflies. They show up every year. Lake Erie is a big breeding ground for them. The clouds of them get so big it can be picked up on doppler weather radar. 

On the bright side, they don't bite or anything (I don't even think they have a mouth at this stage of their life). This is their adult form, and they only live for around 24 hours as adults to breed. They serve as a pretty good source of food for insect eating animals for a few weeks."

1257,"Big agriculture is the raping of nature. Natural farming is possible and increases fertility instead of mining it. Cows aren‚Äôt bad for the environment, the environments they are forced in are bad for the environment. Human manure could be used as a fertility source, urine is basically perfect tomato fertilizer.  Roundup ties up heavy metals plants need to fight diseases which means more pesticides are needed because the plants are weak. Soil is dead and leaving it bare for half the year breaks the water and nutrients cycle and could be the ‚Äúclimate change‚Äù we are looking for. The majority of crops grow in the US don‚Äôt actually go to human consumption. Due to poor soil and lack of water infiltration, farmers are installing tile to make the water run away quicker which leads to nutrient and top soil runoff and major flooding events, Then algal blooms In places like Lake Erie and the Gulf of Mexico.

By alienating many independents and women voters with unpopular gun and abortion legislation, by promoting gerrymandering despite the overwhelming will of the electorate, by ignoring climate change and Lake Erie pollution, and now by burdening us with justices both in the U.S. Supreme Court and at the state level who ignore legal precedent, American history (Supreme Court gun ruling) and the popular will, my hunch is that the Ohio political pendulum will swing away from Trump Republicans over the next four years, if not in 2022.

1310,"In the novel, due to environmental pollutants, industrial waste, AIDS, nuclear plant accidents, pesticides, and the spread of disease, there was a lot of infertility. The reasons were discussed in detail in the Afterword written in the future, and also during the novel Aunt Lydia gives us a contemporary perspective. Basically, the causes of infertility were a laundry list of things people were concerned about in the 1970s and early 1980s. Like nowadays we talk a lot about global warming but back then there was a lot more concern about environmental pollution since there hadn't been an EPA until 10 years before the book was written and environmental pollution ran rampant and was quite visibly bad, with multiple scandals, deaths, and visibly bad air. Lake Erie caught on fire. And AIDS had only been around for a few years and no one knew where it was headed but we were sure it would get worse and spread more into the general community, and at the time Atwood wrote the novel there were no treatments and it was a death sentence within a few years for almost everybody. Also the first IVF baby was in 1978 in the UK and 1981 in the US so when she wrote the book in 1984 it was still the dawn of the really amazing fertility treatments we have now and we had not yet seen its impact so treatments for infertility were more limited. Likewise surrogate motherhood didn't formally start until the year after this came out. So in the novel, some infertility was of women, some was of men, but since Gilead didn't recognize male infertility, only women got blamed or examined. There was an implication that the commanders were older, so their couples were affected by the infertility starting during their fertile years but by the time of the novel, many had aged out of their fertile years. So like the women might have been fertile when younger but the men were not but since that wasn't acknowledged, the fertile women ended up being unimpregnatable (impregnable? unimpregnable?). Others of the women had been fertile but were now too old. 

So basically in the book there might be couples with biological kids and also couples with handmaid-made kids, but due to the nature of the book, they focus only on the handmaid families. TV shows tend to simplify, so they didn't bother showing us the families with bio kids. Though it's implied that even if you have bio kids, you can still get a handmaid as a perk.

As for the fertile women: if a woman is fertile and also does not fall afoul of the new rules of Gilead (such as having had an abortion, gotten divorced, committed adultery, married a man who was divorced, lived with a man out of wedlock, evidence of an affair with a married man, having had a job that was offensive to them in some way, etc.), then such a woman would be a Wife (wife of someone of the upper class) or Econowife (a wife for someone of the lower class). If she had fallen afoul of their rules but was fertile, then she might be executed, sterilized and made into a prostitute, or made into a handmaid. If she was infertile and unmarried, then she might be a Martha if religious, or declared an unwoman and sent to the colonies. Or if young and attractive and thin but sterile, she might be sent to Jezebels to be a prostitute.

But the number of fertile women had overall gone down due to disease and pollution."

1323,"Farming. And geography.

About half of Ohio is flat, glacially scoured plains. The other half is a series of rolling hills, created by ice age glaciers depositing moraines and till through out the state and an ancient, eroded plateau. To the north is Lake Erie, and to the south is the Ohio river. When settlers arrived in Ohio, they encountered a mix of forests, prairies, and wetlands.

The opening of overland roads in the early 19th century, and later the Erie and C&amp;O canals facilitated westward migration. The area centered on Milan, OH became one of the most bountiful agriculture hubs in the world. Milan itself was for a period of around 20 years one of the most busiest ports in the world, despite the town being 10-15 miles inland from Lake Erie. This was possible with the construction of the Milan Canal and Milan Canal Basin.

Basically, Ohio in the early 19th century was easy to get to, great for farming, and easy to ship those agricultural goods elsewhere."

1339,"A lot of the extremely specific stormwater requirements come from applicable permits and watersheds. Does your community have a Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) permit? Are you in a watershed with a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) for Total Phosphorus and/or Suspended Solids? Are you in an undeveloped rural area or an urban area with flooding issues?

In the Midwest near the Great Lakes, for example, there are tons of impaired waterways each with their own level of TMDL implementation status and limits. Some larger Cities even have different quality treatment goals for different areas within City limits depending on the drainage watershed.

I'm a member of a regional stormwater consortium, and our state stopped accepting our regional MS4 reports due to all the specific requirements. 

It's difficult to consolidate all these requirements into a region much less an entire state, especially since the EPA/DNR guidelines aren't exactly set in stone beyond ""make a plan to meet these quality limits,"" and then leave state and local agencies to scramble.

As a land development engineer though, I have to agree on the transparency issue- Dear lordy, do I hate going on a manhunt for stormwater requirements on duct-taped municipal websites, only to call and get ghosted, or find out staff has no clue if they even have an Ordinance. (Not that it's their fault either- municipalities are already stretched so thin and public education/funding in stormwater is severely lacking.)"

1354,"The small fish aren't the ones breeding.  Take enough big females (in most fish, the females are larger) out of a system and you start getting declining numbers of fish.  It's an easy concept

You can easily find 100s of fish populations in both fresh and salt water which have been damaged, heavily reduced, or gone extinct due to over harvest. The Atlantic Cod stock off Canada for example.  Bluefin tuna.  Orange roughy.  Swordfish.  Yellow perch in Lake Erie, and the now extinct blue pike.  

There's nothing wrong at all with responsible harvest of fish.  I keep a few each year myself and enjoy fish dinner.  The problem is the attitude of ""I keep everything that's legal.""  A fat female fish full of eggs should be released.  A rare but important fish in an ecosystem, like a muskie, should be released.  Fish that's just going to end up getting freezer burned because you've already got tons in the freezer?  Yeah, let them go.  Around here we call those people ""pigs."" 

  Being greedy and keeping everything just damages the resource for others.  Why would you release a fish for someone else to catch it? So they can enjoy that fish, too.  Fish populations and the rivers, lakes, streams and oceans they inhabit are constantly on the brink and if you enjoy eating the fish you catch and enjoy fishing, you need to do your part by being responsible with your harvest and preserving it for others to enjoy, too.  It's simple to understand.

Catch and release is what most fisherman these days practice and it's helped preserve fish populations all over the world.  If done properly, the vast majority of fish survive with very little damage and go on to grow and breed."

I am ignorant of the Ohio laws regarding the use of filter strips but given that the area of impact for Lake Erie isn't just Ohio I would imagine you could apply this subsidy anywhere filter strips were NOT mandated.  


Again, I am fairly ignorant on subject of law/use but I know where I am at (Springfield Township) I have driven past many fields that butt up to creeks with what does not appear to be much filter strip width, if any. 15 meters is a hefty chunk of land but if it means preventing massive downstream pollution/buildup of chemicals then it seems like a reasonable use of the funds."
1370,Anyone who has fished in Lake Erie has been wanting this to happen for the past 30 years.
1371,"You realize there was no federal oversight before the 60s, right?  Do you know what happened?  Lake Erie was declared dead because of the amount of pollution in the lake.  I‚Äôll say that again, a lake with 5.2 trillion gallons of water was declared DEAD because within 60 years car companies had dump so many chemicals into the lake it became nearly uninhabitable to anything other than algae.

But by all means, let‚Äôs go back to that."
1372,"&gt; Also, I do not know why anyone eats Lake Erie walleye.

Great lakes fish in general. There was an insane amount of pollution in all of them back in the day, lake superior to a lesser extent but it still has it. PCB levels are high in all predatory great lakes fish including salmon and trout, and there is realistically no safe level of PCB consumption."
1373,"Not sure if you have ever looked into any of the [H2Ohio](https://h2.ohio.gov/about-h2ohio/) work being done. Most of it is trying to push farmers to incorporate several agricultural best management practices, including edge-of-field buffers (aka filter strips), on their farms. The program is just a voluntary opt-in thing, and I think the long term funding is a question (maybe this new federal funding would work its way in somehow at some point), but the state it is trying to push for these practices. Now there is still a lot of intense debate about how well certain practices work, how well they are actually implemented, and who is being targeted as the ‚Äúculprit‚Äù for the pollution so some people are vehemently opposed to H2Ohio, but I look at it as a decent start at least, even if we still have a huge way to go."

1377,"Came here from CLE. I love the city layout here for getting around quicker but my god the drivers are so much worse. The parks are awesome, although I do miss the Cuyahoga valley, all the rail trails, and Lake Erie for sure. When my parents were kids the lake was so gross that no one even dare to swim in it. Laws changed and Cleveland stopped dumping so much which really cleaned up the lake for us to enjoy as kids. Everytime I look at the Ohio river I'm reminded of just how lucky we were to have a clean body of water that large. I just hope one day cities along the ohio get their act together so another generation down the line can get that experience here in Lou."
1378,"This is great news! I love spending time on our lakes. Lake Superior is like a friggin ocean, the small towns around Lake Michigan are idyllic, and of course our Lake Erie is a jewel of the state.

The great lakes are 21% of our planet's freshwater! Access to freshwater will become more and more important. So glad we are taking steps to protect them.

Seems like farm run off may be the single biggest issue for our state. How do we keep the fertilizer and other chems out of the lake(s)?"

My tap water comes from the Olentangy River/Delaware reservoir and yeah, me and and probably 70,000 residents drink it every day. Also you do realize one of the Great Lakes (Erie) is partially in Ohio, right? Because based off of the grammar used in your statement, I am not sure that dawned on you. The facts are that we need to protect our lakes, rivers, and water reservoirs and try and reverse the damage already done to them by past and current pollution because they are the main source of the water that the overwhelming majority of Ohio residents drink. Lake Erie is one of the most polluted of the great lakes and needs the investment to clean it up so it can provide safe clean drinking water for current and future Ohio residents. 

As far as the source of your bottled water..... you ever drink Magnetic Springs bottled water? Bottled right down on Joyce Ave in Columbus, Ohio. That is right dumbass...... Magnetic Springs bottled water is actually good ol' City of Columbus Municipal Water."
1382,"I recognized her as soon as I saw the photo!
The whole case was super strange and there is no way it was a suicide. She gassed up her vehicle, ripped her purse, took her keys, and then ""walked in"" to the Detroit River in the freezing cold, down a snowy ass embankment in heels and let herself...drown? Makes no sense. She ended up being found on Boblo Island in Amherstburg, Ontario. Boblo is one of the last stops on the way out to the lake (Lake Erie), so my guess is whoever did it, was hoping the current would take her out and her body would get lost. There are extremely strong currents in that channel that change very quickly. So, someone seemed to have had knowledge about that. It just seems like they knew where to find her and were expecting her to slip right through, out to the lake and never be found.
It is clear someone was after the poor woman. I really felt for her daughter when I saw the episode on ""Unsolved Mysteries""."

The red triangle represents Ohio‚Äôs history with the Underground Railroad, which American slaves would travel to escape slavery. The triangle pointing up above the bottom blue stripe represents the goal of the Underground Railroad of crossing north over the Ohio river. The Ohio river was the border between slave states and free states. 

The red triangle also represents freedom from slavery by resembling a liberty cap. These pointed red caps are symbols of freedom used in symbology from Rome, America, France, and Haiti

1396,"Farmland is better than McMansions but still not perfect. A lot of the runoff issues that puts fertilizer into large bodies of water as is happening with Western lake Erie is due to farmland. 

I'm obviously no expert in any of these things but I'm wondering if, as somebody said before, increased vegetation in these McMansion areas might meaningfully mitigate some of the extra runoff. It would also make them look better ."
1397,"True, but there are practices in place for runoff, fertilizer managements systems, etc. Albeit not perfect (and some still abuse the systems), as evidenced by the Western Lake Erie. I will also say I personally know farmers who have been awarded ""Conservationist of the Year"" awards from local county Conservation districts for their stewardship for their land, including water conservation practices. I'm sure there are businesses that are winning awards for LEED and other sustainable practices, but I'm not sure subdivisions are winning awards for being stewards of the land and environment. I realize that's comparing apples to oranges, but still the idea of farmers caring for and preserving the land and environment compared to a large scale subdivision development, the farmer often (not always) wins out. 

Something we don't consider is the effect on ecosystem that have been cared for for generations. A ""preserved"" ecosystem on farm or undeveloped land can and often does thrive. When you greatly disturb the ecosystem by mindlessly altering water retention, runoff rates, etc., etc. it have a negative effect. I *think* (I can't remember specifically) there was some concern with some native water species (like the Hellbender) being displayed due to overdevelopment in Indiana County area."

1416,"In the United States it's becoming a very big deal.  Much of the west/coast of the country has been under a serious drought for most of the century - see wildfires from California to Colorado and beyond.

Northern Ohio couldn't pull water from Lake Erie a few years ago because of toxic algae blooms.

In Michigan, surrounded by water, Nestle the corporate giant is rapidly pumping down the aquifers.  They're managing to deplete a water table that is saturated.

It's a pretty big deal, and super expensive.

In Flint, MI, which still does not have a complete safe water system, several factors screwed them.  The city was home to multiple automobile supply chain factories early to mid 20th century, and those factories dumped waste straight into the Flint River.  We'll, all the factories left, exploitable workers were cheaper elsewhere.  the Flint River is still unsafe for use.  A couple years ago the bankrupt city was taken over by the State, who decided the water bill was too high.  So they switched supplies from the Great Lakes to the Flint River, while at the same time cutting use of multiple additives the city usually put in.  This resulted in corrosive water that would dissolve metal, which stirred up the dormant lead, and here we are.

These systems in most of the Eastern U.S. are 100+ years old, local supplies usually dwindling.

1422,"Flint's city manager was appointed by the then Governor Rick Snyder who put Flint into receivership due to insolvency. Snyder and staff, including the city manager, did 3 things.

1. Changed the water source for the city from the Detroit River, which is Lake Michigan/Superior/Huron water flowing south to Lake Erie and is among the cleanest fresh water sources in the country. It is cool (temperature) and flows quickly due to century old dredging to allow freighters to travel from the Atlantic to Chicago.

2. Made the water source the Flint River, which is notoriously polluted.

3. Declined (documented, knowingly, and on purpose) to add chemical agents to clean the water and prevent lead from entering the water from the decades old and unused lead pipes that were in place before the original switch to Detroit water.

Snyder and his appointees murdered predominantly poor citizens of a whole city and retarded the mental and physical development of a generation of children to save money on water, the most essential consumable we rely on as people to survive. Forgive the rant, but we cannot allow this to be forgotten, and it is not the same thing as getting a local, representational government, appointed or elected city manager."

Lumber -Deforestation is a global ongoing issue. Air pollution is an ongoing issue. Semi-Conductor shortages are also an ongoing issue. 

As the world goes short of everything and Canada ""claims"" it wants to REDUCE its carbon footprint, and its REFUSAL to do more nuclear energy it makes NO sense to keep growing its population size. If Canada continues to do so - The existing community will see the QoL go down tremendously as we are seeing already with housing prices. 

Keep in mind MATERIALS are needed to build homes. So wheres the copper exactly coming from; Where exactly are these new lumber mills going; Where are these new cattle farms going to feed these new people you so desire?

This is a ponzi scheme and it needs to come to an end. With tech advancing the need to large standing armies diminishes and there is 0 correleation between a countries population size and the QoL of the people in it. This is madness."

During harvest the tractor will the tractor will shed and discard the crop residue on the surface of the soil soil as well. They may also use injectors to ensure that the fertilizer makes it under the soil, since surface distribution reduces efficiency. Additionally surface distribution of phosphorus under no till agriculture is one of the principal causes of eutrophication in the Great Lakes, specifically lake Erie.

It is rare that a farmer practices never-till,  at least in modern commercial cereal production. Most Farmers who know till will still do a full till every 5 to 7 years.

1494,"We talked a little bit about this in a couple of my environmental policy classes (in Chicago, so Great Lakes were a big topic) about how they‚Äôre managed. 

One topic that came up multiple times was toxic algae blooms in Lake Erie‚Äîheavy influx of fertilizer pollution from the Ohio River combined with a relatively shallower basin (warmer water) has made the Lake have huge blooms regularly during the summer. IIRC they‚Äôve had to shut water off in Cleveland a couple of times because of this. This is also a big problem in Green Bay, and in other parts of Great Lakes. 

In general, it‚Äôs my understanding that pollution can pretty easily become concentrated at certain points of the Lakes because of the way water circulates through them‚ÄîLake Michigan south/southeast of Chicago tends to have higher levels of pollution, chemical and plastic, than much of the rest of the Lake partly because of the population and industrial concentration, but also because of currents in the Lake. 

There has also been a lot of introduced species like mussels because of international shipping. Barges/ships can come all the way from the Atlantic, through Chicago, and on down the Mississippi, and all that traffic brings a lot of invasives."
1495,"We (us in the great lakes region) need to figure out a way to prevent the agricultural runoff from causing these blooms. 

There used to be the Great Black Swamp in NW OH and NE IN, about the size of Connecticut. Civil war and westward expansion led to the swamp being drained and cleared (except for a 300 acre plot now called goll woods). The land has nothing to filter the fertilizer before it hits the Maumee river and then lake Erie. 

I'm working on an EnSci degree right now and live where the black swamp used to be. I think one of our best options is wetland restoration but because of cities like Toledo and the massive agricultural presence, it's not likely."
1496,"Check with local public health departments. Maybe north east Ohio regional sewer district - they‚Äôre doing a project to clean up Lake Erie right now,  but not sure if they offer internships. You could also email faculty at CWRU or CSU to see if they have any environmental science projects you could help out with, although those would probably be unpaid."
1497,"I'm with you, bud.  I have never in my life watched a Lake Erie sunrise and thought, damn, a bunch of giant windmills and technician/maintenance stations would make this look great.

Plus, I don't think anyone in these comments has any understanding of the intersection of the construction of colossal swathes of windmills and lake geology.  That's gonna be unfathomable detritus stirred up, sediment leading to possibly toxic/anaerobic/unlivable water conditions, destruction of millenia-old carbon sinks... throwing an expensive flashy ugly bandaid on the gaping wound that is climate change is just such a terrible last-ditch 'we're progressive, but only as far as the goverment allows us to be' effort.  :("

1502,"That seems like a pretty poor way to group and rate water. Water quality can vary massively within a state. It can be impacted by surface vs ground; what aquifer you are pulling ground water from or how deep the aquifer is; whether the surface water is river, reservoir, or great lake; pollution due to farm runoff it mining and fracking operations impacting the water. Here in Ohio, we have some of the best water in the country (coming from Lake Erie) and some of the worst (polluted water down south from fracking and mining)."

I'm not sure UB CS is exceptionally tough, this may be survivors guilt or something but I don't think any CS program that isn't difficult is really teaching you anything. It can be hard to wrap your head around if you're coming in with zero programming background, and it doesn't get easier (though personally I think if you can pass CSE250 you can basically do anything) but if you dedicate yourself and put in the legwork needed, you can get a lot out of it.

It is also causes many animals to die or fail to reproduce: anti depressants reduce prey survival behavior and can decrease predator hunting leading to starvation or poor health, estrogen from contraceptives, dairy farms, and skin lotions is turning many male wild fish and amphibians into sterile females (I have personally seen 100‚Äôs of male carp fish that had become sterile females in Lake Erie)"

1527,"those look like what we called Zebra Muscles that essentially wiped out the fresh water clams in the Great Lakes (well at least Lake Erie). I remember when then made it to the lakes via a Russian Shipping vessel and they multiply so fast they removed all their native competition.   


They did however really clean up Lake Erie to the point that it's often crystal clear when the water is calm. They really make for a PITA to clean up the beach each year though... The first year after they were accidentally introduced to the Lake, we came to our cottage after the winter and the beach was essentially blanketed with their shells. It's like that pretty much every year now."
1528,"Uhh.. do you live near Lake Erie? Cause those algae blooms are nasty. We couldn't drink tap water for, a week?, in 2014"
1529,"Back in the 80s, Lake Erie began to have a problem with the expansion of an invasive species called a Zebra Mussel. They would coat the surface of everything, even threatening to clog the water intake that provided drining water to Cleveland. They had been brought in the bilgewater of foreign cargo ships. 

Authorities were stumped as to how to get rid of them, and even had a competition with a substantial prize for anyone that could find a solution to get rid of the Zebra Mussels. It turned out, all they had to do was wait.

Lake Erie's water was notoriously murky, full of organic material that made the underwater view very poor. The Zebra Mussels loved that organic material, and it contributed to their spread. As they multiplied, and ingested more and more of the organic matter, sunlight began to penetrate the water for the first time in decades. It turned out that Zebra Mussels didn't like the sunlight, and began to die off. Eventually, they reached an equilibrium between the amount of sunlight and the amount of organic food material and they are no longer considered the big threat they once were. 

The new, clearer waters also spawned a new popularity in wreck diving. Because it is the shallowest of the Great Lakes, storms have always quickly turned dangerous on Lake Erie, and there are more wrecks on the floor of Lake Erie than any other, stretching back to the 17th century. With the higher visibility, it is much easier to explore these shallow water wrecks.

Somehow, nature always finds a way."

""The mollusks, known as zebra and quagga mussels, arrived from Eastern Europe in the late 1980s by latching onto boats and have since spread throughout the Great Lakes.

And, in terms of water quality, the critters are a reverse filter: They remove sediment and food particles out of the water, sapping the resources native mussels and fish need.

But they leave the dangerous elements in place. The invaders are picky and don't absorb toxic forms of algae known as microcystis, leaving it to collect in the harmful blue-green algae blooms that collect on the surface."""

We need to keep rainwater where it falls and minimize paving paradise so our rainfall doesn‚Äôt end up in the Grand / Lake Erie. We should not need a pipeline from the Great Lakes - this will be more expensive to treat as well. Also, we need to maintain some level of canopy for shade / temperature control and biodiversity (a girl can dream?).

AITA for wanting to kick my sons girlfriend ( gf) out?

Some background.  My youngest son (30) and his daughter (4) have been living with me about 3 yrs.  It's been nice.  I only have a 2 bedroom trailer but it's in a lovely place. My front door opens to a view of lake Erie, we have a beach and a pool.  There's only about 20 of us who live here full time, the rest are ppl who own homes and come to their trailers during the summers.  Everyone loves my grandaughter and it's a very safe place to live.  They don't allow trouble makers in here.
About 6 months ago my oldest son asked if he (34) and his gf (23) could move in.  They had nowhere to go, and both my kids inherited my 3 autoimmune diseases which makes it very difficult to hold employment.
My younger son is doing everything he should be.  He has a case manager, has applied for disability ( he's had a job since 16yrs old), he receives counseling and sees his dr.s Once a month.
I told my son he and his gf needed to do the same things.  I didn't realize what I was in for.  They fight non stop.  She's been to the physch ward 3 times, but never follows up with aftercare.  I'm all for giving ppl with mental illness a chance, but not when they refuse the help they've been handed.  I also don't want my grandaughter raised in an abusive environment, and I'm afraid if she keeps screaming well get kicked out.   I told my son his gf had to go.  He called me an asshole for kicking a poor helpless person out.
So Am I being an asshole?  Or am I doing right by putting my grandaughters needs 1st?

1572,Just the backend infrastructure and replacements are not ready to go out world wide. In the states freshwater is about to become a real issue.

1573,"I an old enough, when Richard Nixon signed the EPA into existence, to remember what real pollution is. I remember the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland catching on fire, and Lake Erie was nearly devoid of life. I remember the orange cloud that hung over Gary IN. I remember that you couldn‚Äôt let the Grand River (my home town of Grand Rapids, MI) water touch your skin because of all of the caustic waste that was dumped in it. We nearly caused the extinction of the bald eagle, turkeys, bears..because of toxic pesticides. I remember reading the Time and Newsweek articles convinced that we were on the brink of the next ice age.

All of the above do not exist today. What also doesn‚Äôt exist today are the high paying jobs in any of the industries that did the polluting. The jobs moved overseas to regions that still have no environmental standards. Before we further destroy the USA, let‚Äôs put large tariffs on all imports that do not adhere to our environmental standards. Tariff Chinese steel. Tariff Egyptian leather. After you have cleaned up the countries that we purchase good from, we can then determine what incremental change is still possible in the USA.

Please don‚Äôt be clueless. Learn our history. Starting with the leadership of President Nixon, the USA has become clean."

1586,"Would not recommend swimming in the harbour as it's a collection point of the pollution and runoff heading into the lake.

Swimming by the beach is also not recommended and it's usually closed due to the high amount of e. coli in the water from the bird droppings.  That's a common theme in a lot of the swimming areas.

Christie's and Valens are better but still get closed at times due to the e. coli content.  Also, never go near the water after a storm, all kinds of junk is washed up at that point.

Places like Gulliver's lake are open water swimming but a bit cleaner but you have to pay for admission.

Also, we go in the water on Lake Erie at places like Turkey Point or James N. Allan Park are fairly clean and safe.  I wouldn't want to necessarily drink the water but compared to what Lake Erie was like \~50 years ago I'll take it.  Been swimming there for years and no adverse effects.  Again, wouldn't want to swim in Erie near the old coal power plant or the steel mill but these areas have been good."
1587,"I'm at work so doing zero research, but I'll give it a quick stab.

Fresh water- no issue, Lake Erie, Ohio and many other rivers, you can dig a well almost anywhere and hit water.

Fuel reserves-an abundance of natural gas and coal, but very little oil. Transportation as it exists would be a huge issue. 

Electricity-solar would be tough due to winter and other cloudy months. Wind-dunno. Two functioning nuke plants, that helps. Most coal plants shut down already. Several small natural gas plants. Still, Ohio is a net importer of electricity right now, so would likely be an issue.

Food- big agricultural state, but truncated growing season. I suspect everyone would go back to having a large vegetable garden and canning. Still, would be tough with almost 12 million mouths to feed. We have a shit ton of deer and lots of small game, but it would probably all be hunted to extinction in no time. Same with fish.

Manufacturing-this has certainly dropped off a lot over the decades, but Ohio is still a comparatively large manufacturing state. Wouldn't be too tough to go from manufacturing wants to only needs. But, electrical supply may be an issue, as would a number if raw materials. We still have some steel plants, but little in ore reserves. A lot of manufacturing and research with synthetic rubber, but the raw materials would be an issue.

On balance, yeah, I think we'd be fucked long-term."

1613,"This is a very naive take. First, the actual enforcement of disease checks is severely lacking in most states

Second, many states barely regulate bait suppliers at all. Sure, they have licenses and permits, and occasional inspections. But there's a lot of shady stuff that happens even in the above-board providers. By accident or intention.

 Hell, in some states it is legal to use goldfish as bait, and they can be horribly invasive

Anglers should NEVER release store-bought bait into the water. 

In most cases the bait won't survive, but there's plenty of invasive populations that get started from bait releases. 

Here's a great example:

&gt;Bait and pond stores comprise potential, yet poorly understood, vectors for aquatic invasive species (AIS). We tested for AIS and illegal native species in 51 bait and 21 pond stores from the central Great Lakes (Lake Erie, Ohio and Lake St. Clair, Michigan) and the adjacent Wabash River (Indiana) using environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcode assays of water samples and morphological identifications. Retailers were questioned about supply chains, and anglers surveyed about baitfish use and disposal. Assays revealed unadvertised species eDNA in 100% of bait stores, with 61% containing illegal native non-bait (totaling 13 species) and 88% having AIS (11 species). Illegal native non-bait species included juvenile walleye, yellow perch, and white sucker eDNA. AIS eDNA included Eurasian ruffe in seven stores (all states), silver carp in five (including a Lake Erie store in two separate years), and bighead carp in two Lake Erie stores that also had silver carp. Among pond stores, two in Lake St. Clair had bighead carp eDNA, one also contained silver carp, and a Wabash River location showed European ide. Unadvertised invasive snails were discerned in 55% of pond stores. Four contained zebra mussel eDNA and two had invasive bryozoans. Illegal native species and AIS were widespread, but showed little relationship to the retailers' variable and extensive supply chains. Live baitfish releases were reported by 50% of Lake Erie anglers and 35% in Lake St. Clair. Consumer behavior and AIS prevalence in the bait and pond trades thus pose serious risks for introductions and spread.

It was back in the 90s I was swimming in about six foot of water where I noticed strange little fish on the bottom in which I had never seen before. I reported this sighting to the local Sr aquatic biologist. A couple years later it came out about the round Goby. At that time there was a lot of speculation like the Goby is going to poison the local fish. That never happened as it turned out the round Goby was a favorite treat for many species of fish. One of the effects was the lakes population of yellow Perch was at a severe decline. The perch ended up making a rebound due to feeding on Goby. As I mentioned before there is a major decline of Emerald shinners and rainbow smelt in lake Erie. The lack of Emerald shinners might have been the reason why we seen that decline. Emerald shinners are one of the yellow Perch favorite forage bait fish. Can we call the the minnows Lady? Lol being a over the edge hard core fisherman that's a compliment. Are you single lol

1645,"Biologist? 

No but I attended a lecture on the ecology of climate change and discussing the increasing pr√©venance of Cyanobacteria blooms was a big part of it.

The limiting factors of blooms are different for salt water and freshwater (one is phosphates, one is nitrates).

Again I didn‚Äôt disagree that salt/rock salt has been linked to blooms, but there‚Äôs well established precedent that fertilizer runoff contributes to blooms.

The record setting bloom in Lake Erie back in 2011 wasn‚Äôt from road salt, it was [from fertilizer](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1216006110):

&gt; In 2011, Lake Erie experienced the largest harmful algal bloom in its recorded history, with a peak intensity over three times greater than any previously observed bloom. Here we show that **long-term trends in agricultural practices are consistent with increasing phosphorus loading** to the western basin of the lake, and that these trends, coupled with meteorological conditions in spring 2011, produced record-breaking nutrient loads. An extended period of weak lake circulation then led to abnormally long residence times that incubated the bloom, and warm and quiescent conditions after bloom onset allowed algae to remain near the top of the water column and prevented flushing of nutrients from the system. 

Here‚Äôs a link from NOAA discussing the link between [Urea based fertilizer and Blue-Green Algae blooms](https://coastalscience.noaa.gov/news/urea-based-fertilizer-promotes-blue-green-algal-blooms-in-sarasota-bay-florida/) choking the gulf coast.

But don‚Äôt take it from me, I‚Äôm not a biologist."
1646,"Lake Erie has its fair share of boaters, but with very few exceptions there is no where to go in them.  The water is cloudy and there is nothing to see (other than a few ""wrecks,"" most of which are piles of wood) for scuba divers.  Swimming in the lake on a hot summer day is like being in a bathtub.  Beaches are often cluttered with dead fish and debris.  Pollution is a problem and occasionally beaches are closed because of it.

On the plus side there is kayaking, but that's good for what . . . maybe an afternoon?

Now I have to say that I am strongly biased, having been raised on Long Island where there is much to do on the water.  I very much prefer salt water to fresh.  The oceanic ecology is far different than what the Great Lakes have to offer."

Same situation with Lake Erie, Ontario basically pollutes nothing and prevents development near the shores and the Ohio side is a pollution nightmare"

1650,"Just to clarify:  You intend to to kayak the Huron river from AA to Lake Erie, and then take the Detroit River to Detroit?"

When the skies of November turn gloomy
With a load of iron ore twenty-six thousand tons more
Than the Edmund Fitzgerald weighed empty
That good ship and true was a bone to be chewed
When the gales of November came early
The ship was the pride of the American side
Coming back from some mill in Wisconsin
As the big freighters go, it was bigger than most
With a crew and good captain well seasoned
Concluding some terms with a couple of steel firms
When they left fully loaded for Cleveland
And later that night when the ship's bell rang
Could it be the north wind they'd been feelin'?
The wind in the wires made a tattle-tale sound
And a wave broke over the railing
And every man knew, as the captain did too
T'was the witch of November come stealin'
The dawn came late and the breakfast had to wait
When the gales of November came slashin'
When afternoon came it was freezin' rain
In the face of a hurricane west wind
When suppertime came, the old cook came on deck sayin'
""Fellas, it's too rough to feed ya""
At seven PM, a main hatchway caved in, he said
""Fellas, it's been good to know ya""

The searchers all say they'd have made Whitefish Bay
If they'd put fifteen more miles behind her
They might have split up or they might have capsized
They may have broke deep and took water

Of the wives and the sons and the daughters

In the rooms of her ice-water mansion
Old Michigan steams like a young man's dreams
The islands and bays are for sportsmen
And farther below Lake Ontario
Takes in what Lake Erie can send her

1660,About 1/3 of Ohio is part of the Lake Erie basin. Every creek/river/etc in that basin flows north
1661,Is it safe to swim in Lake Erie?
1662,"Yup.  It's been a long time since the ""lake caught on fire"" days of the 70's ([which was in Cleveland and led to the creation of the EPA](https://www.history.com/news/epa-earth-day-cleveland-cuyahoga-river-fire-clean-water-act)).  The only real problem you have is the lake is so shallow so it gets pretty warm and can foster e. coli levels that are unsafe as some of the beaches closest to the shore.  They test daily and will close those beaches if it exceeds a certain level.  Keep in mind that is for Presque Isle, where they truck in tons of sand every year.  The natural lakefront doesn't have issues like that due to increased circulation, although there are occasional algae blooms.

My personal opinion - I would rather swim in Lake Erie than most rivers in this area, or the ocean.  I grew up there and was a lifeguard on the lake for 4 years, which required open-water certification, but there are no riptides/undercurrents to worry about."
1663,"Okay, so we have Lake Inferior...

Lake Indiana (because of Mike Pence, fuck that guy)

Lake Penis (Look at Lake Ontario and try to say it isn't penis-shaped)

Disaster Lake (Huron has had NUMEROUS shipwrecks)

So, there we go, the Mediocre Lakes."

1667,"The waste is sitting a few miles away from me within meters of lake Erie, as it piles up decade after decade. I don't care if the problem is political or technical, or magickal. Fission plants are a dead end, waste of money that could be better spent."
1668,"One major grip I have with these lists is the cons listed are largely frivolous. The weather has always been unpleasant.

I moved here in January out of state for a one-to-two year job, and will likely leave since I don't care to stay here long term. Don't get me wrong, I'm neutral about Cleveland, but I think a lot of locals are living in self delusion by undermining glaring problems and believing issues will naturally improve themselves over the course of time.

Since you listed the pros (and I do love the city's cosmopolitan food scene, distinct neighborhood, and how easy it is to get around without a car so long as you live downtown), I'll list some cons.

1. **Little public access to the Lake**. I was taken aback by how much private residences and industry block access to Lake Erie. Unlike Chicago, there is almost nowhere in the city where you can take a long drive or walk down the lake front. Edgewater Beach isn't that big and it's normally overcrowded.
2. **Few prosperous neighborhoods doesn't trickle down to the entire city**. I live downtown. Cleveland, like many Rust Belt cities, invests in a few neighborhoods and convinced itself that the entire city is prospering. Sorry, the near Westside, Downtown, and University Circle (counting Little Italy) doesn't discount how distress many neighborhoods are. I literally only go to a few neighborhoods (mostly Shaker Square) for leisure because others are just down right depressing or there's little to no commercial activity.
3. **70 consecutive years of population lost**. There's nothing wrong with having pride in your city, but I'm amazed how people think this trend will naturally reverse itself. The job market here is limited, which is one reason why I'll be looking elsewhere to move. Population lost is always bad for a city; hence, all the empty communities.
4. **Poor race relations**. I'm a Black man who grew up in diverse neighborhoods (mostly Puerto Rican), and I cannot stand the fact that nearly everyone views everything here in Black and White. Although I live downtown, I'm reminded constantly of how unwanted I am in **some** East side suburbs and west side neighborhoods. The whole history of the east side is White flight, and many white residents conflate economic decline with demographic change (seen the same attitudes in my home town, but its targeted towards Puerto Ricans). Cleveland, like many cities, is extremely segregated and even in integrated suburbs, most white families send their children to private school. Most of the integration seems superficial.
5. **The East-West Divide**. I was shocked when life-long residents told me they never went to either side of town until they became adults. As a person who loves to travel, I could not wrap my head around this. This divide shows on Reddit when I asked about restaurants, almost no one had a list of places on both sides of town. Just look at people's comments. Few have cited glaring problems in Cleveland's most distressed neighborhoods, many which I travel to for work or go through to get somewhere."
1669,"&gt;The event was intended to be a harmless fundraising publicity stunt, but the balloons drifted back over the city, Lake Erie, and landed in the surrounding area, causing problems for traffic and a nearby airport. The event also interfered with a United States Coast Guard search for two boaters who were later found drowned. In consequence, the organizers and the city faced lawsuits seeking millions of dollars in damages,  and cost overruns put the event at a net loss.

1684,"Thanks for your litter picking efforts and for trying to get this reported! Unfortunately, even if some heavier flows came through and pushed the trash out it would just be shifting the problem somewhere else, Lake Erie or further downstream, so like you indicated, a cleanup would definitely be in order. If the city isn‚Äôt very responsive (hopefully they are) Partners for Clean Streams would probably be another good group to bring this up with. 

I did want to mention to anyone that wasn‚Äôt aware that the city has recently used grant money to install ‚Äútrash trappers‚Äù (unfortunately not as cool as trash wheels) in local waterways to collect trash, and one of them is located near here just a bit upstream from the confluence of Swan Creek and the Maumee. So hopefully this trash trappers is working and keeping more trash from flowing down into the problem area OP noted, and it‚Äôs worth noting that the city is actively trying to reduce trash in our waterways. But that‚Äôs all tangential to the issue reported here, just wanted to share in case anyone hadn‚Äôt heard about this yet.

Toledo, OH, a city of 250,000, had no clean drinking water for several days a few summers ago because the water in Lake Erie that they treat for drinking water was so tainted, they couldn‚Äôt treat it enough.

The bill calls for that 1.2 trillion to be spent over 5 years. In reality, most communities won‚Äôt see any of that money for 2 or 3 years as it has to be divided up appropriately. 1.2 trillion =  $240 billion a year. For comparison, the military budget is $725 billion a year. We most definitely will need more.

Since then, it has been cleaned up substantially and has been a clean and productive fishery. Also, the presence of invasive zebra mussels has been detrimental for a lot of species and a nuisance for recreation in the Great Lakes, but they are filter feeders and have cleaned the shit out of the waters.

Another indicator of water quality improvement is the growing musky populations. These fish require fairly clean water and are considered an ""indicator species,"" which basically just means their presence is a sign of cleanliness."

1741,"A$69 million environmental cleanup of the former Bethlehem Steel site in Lackawanna is poised to begin next year, clearing the way for the public to gain access to that portion of the Lake Erie waterfront for the first time in more than a century.

State officials on Wednesday announced that they have finalized remediation plans for the 489 acres of contaminated land nearest to the shoreline of the lake.

Those plans build on efforts that have already been underway for some time. Those efforts were unveiled in May and subject to public comments that were addressed in documents that detail the steps that will be taken and why that remedy was selected.

The aim is to restore the property and natural habitat in a way that protects human health and the environment, while advancing the state Department of Environmental Conservation's goals of preserving and connecting the site's natural resources, state officials said.

""My family worked at the Bethlehem Steel plant and I know firsthand what cleaning up the former site in Lackawanna means for the people who live here,"" said Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Lackawanna native. ""Today marks a critical milestone in the rebirth of this city and this project is the perfect example of how New York State is rebuilding communities by putting former industrial sites like Bethlehem Steel to good use.""

Once a dominant force in Lackawanna, Bethlehem Steel had used more than 1,600 acres for iron and steel production during its heyday, but left the site contaminated with arsenic and other metals, along with semi-volatile organic carbon compounds related to the use of rail transportation, oils, greases and fossil fuels, according to the state.

The remediation plans were required as part of a 2020 consent order about the cleanup between the DEC, Tecumseh Redevelopment and Tecumseh's former parent company, Arcelor Mittal USA, which assumed environmental responsibility after Bethlehem Steel's 2001 bankruptcy.

Various parts of the site will be handled under the state Superfund program, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Corrective Action Program and Brownfield Cleanup Program.

""The cleanup and redevelopment of the former Bethlehem Steel site will be transformative for the City of Lackawanna and all of Western New York,"" said DEC Commissioner Basil Seggos. ""This rebirth, advancing under DEC oversight to ensure it is protective of public health and the environment, will yield benefits for the entire community.""

The construction and cleanup work is expected to take seven years to complete. Details of the plans are available online."

Rescuers spotted their 16-foot (4.9 m) boat anchored west of the Edgewater Park breakwall. A Coast Guard search and rescue helicopter crew had difficulties reaching the area because of the ""asteroid field"" of balloons. A search-and-rescue boat crew tried to spot the fishermen floating in the lake, but Guard officials said balloons in the water made it impossible to see whether anyone was in the lake. On September 29, the Coast Guard suspended its search. The fishermen's bodies subsequently washed ashore.

1781,"Most polluted areas are government owned, air and waters. This means that the government, as the owner, allowed the pollution.

&gt; But government ownership is not true ownership, because the government officials, while able to control the resource cannot themselves reap their capital value on the market. Government officials cannot sell the rivers or sell stock in them. Hence, they have no economic incentive to preserve the purity and value of the rivers. Rivers are, then, in the economic sense, ""unowned""; therefore government officials have permitted their corruption and pollution. Anyone has been able to dump polluting garbage and wastes in the waters. But consider what would happen if private firms were able to own the rivers and the lakes. If a private firm owned Lake Erie, for example, then anyone dumping garbage in the lake would be promptly sued in the courts for their aggression against private property and would be forced by the courts to pay damages and to cease and desist from any further aggression. Thus, only private property rights will insure an end to pollution ‚Äî invasion of resources. Only because the rivers are unowned is there no owner to rise up and defend his precious resource from attack. If, in contrast, anyone should dump garbage or pollutants into a lake which is privately owned (as are many smaller lakes), he would not be permitted to do so for very long ‚Äî the owner would come roaring to its defense.1 Professor Dolan writes:

&gt; &gt;With a General Motors owning the Mississippi River, you can be sure that stiff effluent charges would be assessed on industries and municipalities along its banks, and that the water would be kept clean enough to maximize revenues from leases granted to firms seeking rights to drinking water, recreation, and commercial fishing.2

People in general don‚Äôt seem to realize soaps=/=detergents. Soap is a chemical category for specific things with defined characteristics. Detergents are not the same. 

Neither of these products are really naturally occurring though and as such, have side effects in manufacturing and in use. If you put dawn dish soap in water for example, it is chemically interacting with that water.

1786,"That's exactly what it is. Dofasco is quenching at 2 and 3 coke ovens. As well, as far as I know, Stelco is still producing coke for Lake Erie Steel.

We won't have to worry about this in 6 years as Dofasco is getting rid of their coke ovens and blast furnaces to reduce carbon emissions."

1795,"Indeed Lake Erie is kind of known as a not very ""swimmable"" lake due to the algae blooms from pollution. Even Lake Michigan has that issue due to factories and farm run off.

Though you can find some great beach glass."
1796,"No, I fully understand their point. They made an assumption, and you circled back with a nice copypasta that, while true in certain areas and certain courses, is not the leading factor in algal blooms‚Ä¶ At least not the Great Lakes, if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre referring to.

Massive factory farms, the shallow depth of the western basin of Lake Erie, and municipalities draining untreated sewage directly into bodies of water are causing algal blooms. Not golf courses."
1797,Have you heard of this little patch of water called Lake Erie?
1798,"Hundreds of dead fish washing up on the beach in Lake Erie. It‚Äôs putrid and disgusting. But not as bad as the lake being hit with a dirty patch, causing my water to not only smell weird and like rotting eggs, but it was yellow and orange too. Thought it was pipes and rust at first, but it was a dead patch in the lake.

Lake Erie is nasty"
1799,"when i lived in ohio there was  a time where we literally couldn't drink the water or do anything with it

for 3 weeks

no tap water, if you drink the tap water you get cancer-aids or whatever because farmers would not, and will not, stop  dumping cow shit and chemical shit directly into lake erie

like they don't just let it all seep into the groundwater, some of them fucking collect that waste and then intentionally drive a truck of fucking toxic cancer waste and dump it straight into the lake 


And they're never going to do anything about it. Lake Erie can **only** get more toxic because farmers are securing complete control over the state."

1804,"I'll tell you how my dad did it.  Bought a house in the sticks, way out of town, with a down payment given entirely to him by his parents.  They were willing to live out there because there were really very few cities outside of NYC that really had a city center worth living in.  The sticks was as good as anything else and the cities were dirty.  Now if you live in the sticks in your 30s, you're a loser, so everyone fights for the same 20 houses.

Next, his generation raped the environment to get their money.  In Los Angeles in the late 1970s, the air was literally brown.  Lake Erie routinely caught on fire.  Minerals were strip mined, where they just dug a big pit, left a bunch of toxic waste lying around and then abandoned it.  Forests were clear cut, and then left to fend for themselves.  It was all leaded gasoline and no catalytic converters.  That made everything cheap and abundant.  Now we don't do any of that and everything is much more expensive

Finally, his generation excluded a lot of people.   That 850 tuition was only available if you were white.  They started busing the black kids into the suburbs and public support for subsidized tuition at public universities evaporated.  Government unions stepped in to soak up all the money that used to be given to public universities.

And private universities made a lot of their tuition money doing war research for the federal government.  College students protested and kicked the war research off campus.  Tuition went up.

So much so that the black kids they were admitting no longer could afford to come.  So they doubled tuition so that they would have extra money to subsidize tuition for those they really wanted but couldn't afford it.  Everyone in the middle was left to fend for themselves in a world in which everything doubled.

And here we are.  It's great that you care about all the things the prior generations did not.  But if you think that has no costs, you are foolish."
1805,"Now, let's talk about Lake Erie."
1806,"Camp Perry's continued openness is so weird.

The Ohio Military Reserve isn't the only one at Perry. The volunteer Ohio Naval Militia operates out of Perry and is responsible for securing the impact area on Lake Erie that you were firing into."
1807,"My Mom grew up in Buffalo. She was 13 when the cold snap of January 1977 dumped a 15 foot snow drift on the Skyway. 

Also, back then, Buffalo was suffering from *real* pollutants, not life-creating CO2. Lake Erie was a foul smelling soup of algae, industrial effluent, agricultural chemicals and raw sewage.

1822,is that eastern basin tributary of Lake Erie- maybe PA or NY?
1823,"You can find Dubna, a small town three hours away from Moscow by train, both on a map and in the periodic table: dubnium, element number 105, was discovered at a research center there, and named after the town. A hasteless town, Dubna is defined as much by the surrounding forests as by the water: it sits on the banks of the Ivankovskoe Reservoir, the first part of a massive hydropower project called ‚ÄúBig Volga‚Äù whose construction spanned decades during the Soviet era. The complex, consisting of 11 dams on the Volga and its largest tributary, the Kama, is responsible for about 5% of the total electricity production in Russia. The Ivankovskoe Reservoir is both the oldest part of the complex and the farthest upstream, situated almost at the Volga‚Äôs headwaters.

About 2,300 miles long, the Volga‚Äîsometimes referred to as ‚ÄúVolga-matushka,‚Äù or ‚ÄúMother Volga‚Äù‚Äîis the longest river in Europe and the biggest by water flow, arcing from northwest of Moscow around and down to the Caspian Sea. Some 60 million people‚Äîabout 40% of Russia‚Äôs population‚Äîlive in its basin, which spans almost a tenth of the country‚Äôs vast territory. Moscow, with its 12 million people, gets most of its drinking water from the Volga via the Moscow Canal. About 1,500 miles downstream, the strategic port city of Volgograd, formerly known as Stalingrad, was the site of World War II‚Äôs most decisive, and arguably bloodiest, battle. As an artery of commerce, a source of energy and drinking water, and a conveyor of history, the Volga touches nearly every aspect of life in Russia. It is what the Mississippi is to the United States or the Rhein to Germany.

When the station in Dubna was designed, in the early 1930s, the young Soviet state had just decided to catch up with the capitalist states of the West by rapidly accelerating its industrial development‚Äîbut in order to do so, it needed to generate energy on a massive scale. By the time the last station was built, in the 1980s, the Soviet Union, having just hosted the Olympics for the first time, was about to launch perestroika, a program of large-scale democratic reforms intended to end an era of stagnation and revitalize the flailing state. The history of the Big Volga project is, in a sense, the history of Soviet industrialization. It is also a history of rivalry with the US, which for decades raced the Soviets to build bigger, more impressive dams.

The project was one of the largest nature-transforming schemes in history: put together, the artificial reservoirs on the Volga are about as big as Lake Erie. It tried to harness the river to provide the Russian people with necessary things: energy, transportation, and water. But it tried to do too much.

The river has become polluted, silted up, and overwhelmed by invasive species. Water flows at a tenth of the speed it did before the dams were constructed, according to estimates by researchers at the Institute of Ecology of the Volga River Basin, in the central Russian port city of Togliatti. Widespread toxic algal blooms are now common.

As global temperatures rise, the Volga basin is getting less and less rainfall in the spring and summer, and more snow in the winter. Igor Mokhov, chief scientist at the Obukhov Institute of Atmospheric Physics of the Russian Academy of Sciences, points out that the intensity of spring and summer precipitation is expected to increase, making post-high-water planning more difficult. A team of Russian hydrologists, writing in an August 2021 paper in Ecohydrology &amp; Hydrobiology, argued that because of climate change, ‚Äúthere will be more water in those regions \[of Russia\] where it is sufficient, and less where it is most needed.‚Äù The Volga basin is one of the regions most at risk, they wrote.

It is not an exaggeration to say that Russia‚Äôs mother river is broken.

I visited Dubna on a windy November morning. Runners in colorful clothing zipped by people walking their dogs along an unkempt reservoir front. I found myself in a grayscale photo of milky clouds and water like quicksilver, interrupted by the odd patch of evergreen and autumn brown. The opposite side of the reservoir was an impenetrable wall of coniferous trees, shrouded in a light mist.

I was trying, in vain, to orient myself to figure out how exactly one of the better-known stories about this reservoir must have unfolded. The story goes that in late November 1941, German forces were closing in on Moscow and had planned to cross the frozen body of water. The hydropower station workers reportedly decided to drain the reservoir, dropping water levels abruptly by two meters, crushing the ice and buying the city some time by stopping the invaders in their tracks. Eighty years later, though it was the same time of year, there was no ice in sight.

The hydropower station itself is a restricted site, encircled with an abundance of barbed wire, warning signs, and towering cranes so enormous there are small buildings on top of them. The noise of the water was pierced by seagulls and the occasional car as I walked along the dam. It was Unity Day, a modern Russian holiday devised to supersede a Communist holiday celebrating the 1917 revolution. Some of these people were driving to the Vladimir Lenin statue, a spot beloved by locals.

I could see Lenin‚Äôs back at the end of the road. The statue was surrounded by ceremonial blue-green fir trees, and looked across the water at nothing in particular. The corresponding monument to Joseph Stalin had been demolished in 1962, after the Soviet government decided to ‚Äúde-Stalinize‚Äù itself. The two monuments, each almost 40 meters tall, once guarded the entry point to the Moscow Canal, a Soviet engineering marvel connecting the Volga and Moskva rivers.

Beside the complex, there is a memorial hardly taller than I am. It looks like a random granite building block, tilted to the side, seemingly thrown out by the mighty waters to the foot of the Lenin monument and behind its back. The stone was placed there in 2013 to commemorate the more than 22,000 prisoners who died building the canal. Flowers and wreaths at the bottom were still fresh from the annual ceremony, held on October 30, when Russians remember those persecuted and murdered by the state, usually by reading their names aloud in front of countless similar memorials across the nation.

A young boy in a yellow jacket asked his mother, who was putting their things into the car parked near the memorial, ‚ÄúMom, what‚Äôs written on the stone?‚Äù

To the builders of the canal, she responded without looking.

This only made him ask her another question: ‚ÄúWhy builders? Isn‚Äôt the Volga a real river?‚Äù

In a way it isn‚Äôt really a river anymore‚Äîit no longer flows naturally. It is now so mediated by human intervention that it is better thought of as a machine.

Just two months after the first gulag prisoners had arrived at the future dam site in Dubna, in November 1933, research bigwigs at the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union gathered in Moscow to discuss the state of the Volga and the Caspian Sea. Evgeny Burdin, a historian in the Volga town of Ulyanovsk, some 900 miles downstream from Dubna, read to me from one of the reports presented at the meeting. The report predicted that reservoirs would cause ‚Äúswamp formation due to flooding, poor conditions for soil self-restoration, flooding of cellars in homes, changing microclimate, algae blooms and stale water, pollution, slowing down of water flow, and local risks of malaria.‚Äù

The river has become polluted, silted up, and overwhelmed by invasive species. Widespread toxic algal blooms are now common.

‚ÄúEven if there wasn‚Äôt deep public awareness and discussion, surely many of the hydrologists and engineers knew that there would be significant and unavoidable impacts ‚Ä¶ Many people were aware of it, but it was very difficult, I‚Äôm sure, to say anything,‚Äù Paul R. Josephson, a professor of Russian and Soviet history at Colby College, told me."

&gt;CUYAHOGA RIVER FIRE

&gt;The¬†CUYAHOGA RIVER FIRE¬†(22 June 1969) dramatized the extent of the river's pollution and the ineffectiveness of the city's lagging pollution abatement program. The fire, which witnesses reported reached as high as 5 stories, began at 12 P.M. and lasted about 20 minutes before it was brought under control. A fireboat battled the blaze on the water while units from 3 fire battalions brought the flames on the railroad trestles under control. The bridge belonging to the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Co. sustained $45,000 in damage, forcing the company to close it to rail traffic. The other trestle, belonging to the¬†[NEWBURGH &amp; SOUTH SHORE RAILROAD CO.](https://case.edu/ech/articles/n/newburgh-south-shore-railway/), incurred damages estimated at $5,000 but remained open. The blaze apparently was caused by an accumulation of oily wastes and debris on the river under 2 wooden trestles at the foot of Campbell Rd. hill, SE, in Cleveland. According to a subsequent investigation by Cleveland's Bureau of Industrial Wastes, the fire probably came from a discharge of highly volatile petroleum derivatives with a sufficiently low flash point to be ignited by a chance occurrence at the site of the railroad bridges.
Cleveland's reputation was severely damaged by the fire because at the time there was national concern about the pollution of Lake Erie and the rivers and streams that fed into it‚Äîparticularly the Cuyahoga River, which was among the most polluted in the country. Ironically, another oil slick burned on the Cuyahoga River in 1952 causing an estimated $1.5 million damage without attracting national attention.

1857,"I remember back in the early 1970s Lake Erie was legendary for its filth and stink. It was a godsend when regulations were put in place and we cleaned up America.

I hate to bring politics into this, but for 2021 Trump slashed funding for the Environmental Protection Agency by 26%, cut 50 of their programs, and a massive cut to research and development. All because coal and oil paid him big money to not have the EPA up their ass. Why coal and oil? Ask Putin. Follow the money!! So now we're going back to the 1970s era trying to clean up our own mess.

In the capital city, in 2015, we had water closets shut down to entire areas of the city due to toxic blooms that couldn‚Äôt be boiled off get into the tap water. As late as 1992? Or 93 they were still finding DDT in the water table when the EPA did spot checks. We were the state that set Lake Erie on fire due to lax EPA rules. As late as 2009 there was a mass avian die off due to cooking oil that was dumped into the cuyahoga river and along the coast of eerie that no none was ever caught and prosecuted thanks to lax rules and enforcement.

These morons are now in charge of the health and safety in a state the EPA said has an area with the fastest rise of the new Covid variant- in the capital city so it may actually affect them and their family except they all went on vacation while our governor still does at least weekly updates or daily updates on what we COULD do to save ourselves since he can‚Äôt order a mandate and they sent death threats to the doctor who kept Ohio protected last year."
1886,"The 70s - had to argue with people about not littering, Lake Erie was dying - the world was so disposable. Then, Hanford nuclear site."
1887,"&gt;The southernmost point in Canada

Okay, so as an Australian with no real knowledge of Canada's geography, that sounded pretty fishy to me. 

But no, I'm wrong. The southern-most tip of Canada is an island in Lake Erie which is slightly to the south in latitude than the northern-most border of California.

I should have known not to doubt the Canadian Wikipedia, eh?"
1888,There are a lot of other reasons not to swim in Lake Erie besides currents. Source: I live on Lake Erie.
1889,"Meh, my 93 year old dad used to swim in Lake Erie when he was a kid, back when it was literally an open sewer. 

He said you would occasionally see poop floating in the water.

He says that's why he's lived so long, made him immune to disease.

Up until 2020, he had never been in the hospital."

I found this [site](https://instaswimusa.com/is-it-safe-to-swim-in-lake-worth-texas/), which says that ""there aren‚Äôt any known sources that we could find of pollution in Lake Worth."" That's simply not true - the air base was also a manufacturing plant since WWII, and that that rain runoff took PCBs and other chemicals into the water  for decades.

1895,"**[Balloonfest '86](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloonfest_'86)** 
 
 &gt;Balloonfest '86 was a 1986 event in Cleveland, Ohio, United States, in which the local chapter of United Way set a world record by releasing almost one-and-a-half million balloons. The event was intended to be a harmless fundraising publicity stunt, but the balloons drifted back over the city, Lake Erie, and landed in the surrounding area, causing problems for traffic and a nearby airport. The event also interfered with a United States Coast Guard search for two boaters who were later found drowned. In consequence, the organizers and the city faced lawsuits seeking millions of dollars in damages, and cost overruns put the event at a net loss.

1896,"I‚Äôm gonna give rebuttals using the number scheme op used. Also, it‚Äôs worth mentioning I am an environmental scientist, so this is my educated opinion here. 

1.) Solar panels can be placed a lot of places in a lot of ways. You can stagger them so there‚Äôs a row of panels and a row of prairie. This actually makes the panels more effective as well since the plants help keep them cool through transpiration. At the very least, they‚Äôre less ugly than a coal power plant. They also won‚Äôt slowly give you cancer.

2.) So are the panels going in a forest or crop land?? I would agree that they shouldn‚Äôt put the panels on what would have been forest, but that‚Äôs very unlikely to happen anyway with how much deforested fallow land sits idly by. Farms are not part of the environment. Period. There are very few things that are more unnatural than huge monocultures of nonnative, domesticated plants. Farms actually cause a lot of pollution in Ohio. I can elaborate on this if you like, but it‚Äôs also very easily investigated. Look into the Lake Erie harmful algal bloom. Ohio farmers also are often paid to over farm or not farm at all. The US has had massive surpluses of both corn and soy since the 70‚Äôs. We clearly do not need to produce this much and can loose a little farm land. 

3.) Fighting climate change and local pollution is so incredibly much more expensive than the tax will be to build a solar facility. Plus, coal and gas have huge hidden fees that the tax payers cover as well. We fund the EPA and OEPA. If they have to spend millions if not more to fix superfund after superfund caused by fossil fuels, then that bill will be floated by us. 

4.) How much tourism? Good God, are people really that repulsed by blue, gray panels? Also, y‚Äôall think these panels are just going to be causally next to your downtown, lake, or river?? No, they‚Äôre gonna be in the middle of a field. 

5.) Once again, I really don‚Äôt think this ones that big of an issue either. I did a quick search and could only find evidence that it would increase your property values. Either way, I genuinely would let my house price depreciate by a few thousand if it means fewer fossil fuels.

6.) This is the most valid of the arguments, by far. I will give y‚Äôall that. It is hard if not near impossible *currently* to recycle panels that have reached the end of their life, but it is still by far more efficient and less polluting to go solar over fossil fuels. Considering [researchers estimated that exposure to particulate matter from fossil fuel emissions accounted for 18 percent of total global deaths in 2018 (which is 8 million people, a little less than 1 out of 5)](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/news/2021/02/deaths-fossil-fuel-emissions-higher-previously-thought) I‚Äôd say that solar is still by far a winner. Panels are getting more sophisticated, less expensive, more effective, and more recyclable every year. Their recyclability is so much of an easier problem to fix than the carnage fossil fuels creates every day. 

I‚Äôm sorry if I‚Äôm being aggressive. Protecting the environment is literally job and a moral obligation of mine. It‚Äôs so sad to see people fall the blatant misinformation. A lot of politicians, at every level, are paid off by the fossil fuel industry. They play dirty and want to do things that they know will hurt us all. It is in your best personal health interests as well as all of our best interests about the climate to help end our utter dependence on fossil fuels. These politicians and corporations are using anyone who will listen to them. They‚Äôve been doing it since the beginning."
1897,"I know in the Great Lakes that zebra mussels are a big problem, I don't know if they are one of the contributing factors to algae blooms though. Lake Erie especially gets hit hard with algae blooms pretty frequently due to a combination of being warmer and shallower than the other lakes and agricultural runoff. I guess it's possible that the mussels could play a role in it as well."
1898,There was a rumor many years ago that lake Erie is polluted by the little beads you find in acne cream

1908,Yup. As adults they only live about 24 hours after spending several years a s nymphs. Lake Erie has swarms of them every year. The healthier the lake the more bugs?

1916,"The double chain lift on Twister at Knoebels makes me laugh every time. It's so weird, like something straight out of Roller Coaster Tycoon.

And I haven't been on anything with a better view than the top of Ravine Flyer II's lift hill, especially at sunset. You are staring directly at the beaches of Presque Isle and the aqua/teal water of Lake Erie."
1917,"It's pretty far along in planning, not sure exactly when they'll start the project though.  Initially they wanted to be done by 2023 but I can't see how that will happen.

The reason why?  The dam is obsolete.  It used to be used by a power plant upstream for cooling (Ohio Edison) -- that power plant was removed many years ago.  It also was used for hydroelectric power until 1958.  Now all the dam does is impede the river and degrade water quality.   Removing it means, in theory, you could paddle from Kent all the way to Lake Erie - but a free flowing river is a very healthy river."
1918,"I am absolutely not an expert by any means but there has to be some sort of environmental changes happening that are sending these birds elsewhere.



I mentioned in a comment above that we now have White Pelicans that have been coming back to our area the past few years (north Ohio, along the Lake Erie shoreline), and if you look at their range in bird books or the Merlin app, they aren't native to the area. Last year we had a Brown Booby near Akron after one of the hurricanes (I do think this one was displaced by one). Last year we had a Snowy Owl come down at the beginning of November, and while they aren't totally rare to see here, seeing them in November is crazy early. The past few years we have had a few Painted Buntings up here during spring migration. There was a Northern Wheatear in the northern Ohio area early this year as well, and if you don't know what those are, they are absolutely not native to this area. We had Piping Plovers nest up here for the first time in 80 years.


Something is definitely going on to cause us to see birds like this more frequently. We have had a massive comeback in Bald Eagle population here and we are on a major flyway for migration, so birds are never on short supply here. It doesn't explain what is going on with sightings like the Spoonbill though. I wonder if there will be studies done regarding the movement of these birds."

&gt;‚ÄúBiodegradable‚Äù lanterns made of bamboo take decades to break down, and can injure or entrap animals in the meantime. They can also start dangerous fires. More than 30 animals died in Germany after floating lanterns started a fire inside a local zoo.

&gt;Sky lantern fires endanger people as well.

&gt;In 2013, a sky lantern ignited a fire in The West Midlands, UK that injured 13 of the 200 firefighters who responded to the blaze and created ¬£6m in damage.
Sky lanterns have caused flight delays at major airports in China, Thailand and other countries. Just one lantern could take down a plane if it got sucked into a jet engine.
Many countries ban sky lanterns, including: Argentina, Austria, Australia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Germany, New Zealand, and Spain. Twenty-nine US states ban sky lanterns as do some parts of Canada.

&gt;Wales have banned sky lanterns on all council land since 2018, but they remain legal in England and Scotland. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA), Marine Conservation Society and other groups urge concerned citizens to contact their MP.

Here is a statement from the water treatment group 

Late last week, Lake Erie experienced a considerable thermocline inversion causing the lake water to ‚Äúturn over‚Äù. This brought up water with very low oxygen levels from the deeper part of the lake to the surface. Coupled with a constant wind and storms over the weekend, this has caused a number of issues including sizable fish-kills, algal die-off, increased amounts of manganese in the raw water, strong odor, and high turbidity (cloudiness) in the raw lake water. This water is very difficult to treat and has affected nearly all water treatment facilities on Lake Erie, especially those in the central basin.

First, we would like to take this opportunity to assure you that the treated water supplied to the area municipalities continues to meet the stringent water quality standards established by Ontario Regulation. The water system‚Äôs contracted operating authority, the Ontario Clean Water Agency, has been working diligently to ensure the treated water quality continues meet the drinking water standards; however, some consumers may notice a change in the appearance and taste of the water as a result.

To address the low oxygen levels and higher manganese content, the water treatment plant has made some temporary operational changes to address the current circumstances. These include an increase in chlorine levels to compensate for the higher-than-normal chlorine demand and ensure adequate disinfection prior to the supply of water to area municipalities, as well as increased the use of powder activated carbon to combat the strong taste/odors associated with the event.

The supply of water from the Elgin Area Water System to the City of London has been temporarily discontinued to allow the water treatment facility to address these very challenging raw water conditions at lower flow rates.

Our counterparts along the north shore of Lake Erie continue to struggle with these conditions, many in much worse circumstances that what we‚Äôre experiencing. The lake conditions have slowly but continually improved somewhat from the initial onset of the event late last week, but it will likely be well into the week before we return to more normal conditions.

Our treatment plant operations staff have been keeping our counterparts in the various municipal water operations advised throughout this event and will continue to do so until the issue has returned to more normal conditions.

Consumers are encouraged to contact your local municipality should you experience any issues with the drinking water supplied to your residence or business.

Oh I see they have an additional statement 
By mid-week, conditions on Lake Erie continue to improve and raw water quality has started to return to more-normal conditions. While dissolved oxygen levels in the raw water continue to improve, they remain at below-normal levels. 

The treated water from the Elgin Area water treatment plant has significantly improved, with pH returning to normal conditions. The plant continues to dose higher rates of powder activated carbon to mitigate issues with taste and odour. 

The supply of drinking water to the City of London from the Elgin Area Water System was restarted earlier this week, but at lower daily volumes than normal. The City of London continues to be primarily supplied from the Lake Huron Water Supply System as normal.

Questions or concerns from consumers about the supply of drinking water from their municipal water distribution system should contact their local municipality."

Plus ownership of the lake itself is questionable under any circumstance. Who owns Lake Erie? The first (white) person to find it and claim it? Then anyone who ever fished on it can go fuck himself?

The sad thing is that this dipshit is from the area where the farm runoff is causing algae blooms in Lake Erie.  It would probably be good for the rural people of NW Ohio if some of that land was used for solar panels which don‚Äôt get sprayed in poo slime that ends up in the lake."

I did a GIS internship for a state watershed restoration department. MS4s, BMPs, and TMDLs all day. Their environmental department probably has some GIS imap stuff for TMDLs and watersheds at the very least. Play around with them. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormwater has some good info. The sites for your state will have good info too. The EPA page for your state will also have good info. Looks at stuff for Maryland if your state doesn‚Äôt have much, MD does a good job on this. 

Also look up BMPs for storm water. You might end up mapping a lot of those. BMPs are Best Management Practices, like making new developments build storm water retention ponds so all their runoff doesn‚Äôt flood the existing community downhill from them.

Lake St. Clair would have about 80% ice coverage, now down to 30 to 40%. Lake Superior would never completely freeze over though it was up to about 60%, last winter only 33% had ice cover. Generally all the bays and rivers off the lakes freeze. I haven't seen the Detroit River freeze over since about 1993.

There is no doubt that climate change has had influence on the ice coverage and in turn, the lack of ice coverage has impacted weather in the entire region."

This is the kind of thing I was getting at. There are many examples of waterways that were completely trashed during industrialization through the middle of the 1900s. Lake Erie is a pretty well known example in the US. Air quality would be another area - think London fog. Forest management, conservation lands, waste treatment, etc would be some other areas.

My background is in geoscience; I can't help but see Earth as one interconnected system. I often forget that's not true for everyone.

So let me try again.

**TL;DR**: The source of your water is less of a problem than what happens when you're done with it. The less used water that flows forth from your lawn, the fewer serious problems downstream.

Without knowing exactly where you are, I can't dig in to find out the details of your watershed, so this is necessarily going to come across as a bit vague and/or generic.

I see two major ways in which watering your (presumed) monoculture lawn is problematic: one close to home and one much farther away.

Watering from your local Great Lake isn't ideal--far better to plant a variety of native things which can thrive in your climate zone without extra irrigation--but the real problem is what comes off your lawn. A monoculture grass lawn can't absorb much of a major rain or snowmelt event, particularly if the water table is already high. What it can't use becomes stormwater runoff, which carries pollutants from your lawn and any pavement it touches into storm drains. The storm drains, in turn, feed the local waterways, which feed the Lakes and the rivers. 

I don't know which of the Lakes you're on, but [here's](https://www.ijc.org/en/green-without-envy-great-lakes-drown-excessive-nutrient-pollution) a bit about nutrient--that is, fertilizer--pollution in Lake Erie which gives a bit of insight into why that's problematic: fish die-offs, potential freshwater supply disruption, and potential vectors of disease for humans and birds.

The farther from home part depends on your watershed situation. IF there's a river that your watershed feeds, odds are that that river flows into the Mississippi, which flows into the Gulf of Mexico. The runoff from your lawn (hypothetically) contributes to runoff from other lawns and agricultural operations all the way downstream to the Gulf, where it contributes to a nutrient pollution issue which negatively impacts the Gulf's ecosystem and the people who make their living from it.

The reason it's best to keep as much rainwater as we can where it falls is that it minimizes such problematic runoff."
2051,"Yeah but as far as I know, even in 2021 they don‚Äôt suggest you swim in Lake Erie."
2052,"Go to cincy.  Do a day trip to Lake Erie.  Well, Lake Erie may be closer."
2053,"Back in the 60s Lake Erie was pretty bad and there was a river in Ohio that caught fire back then but that's pretty much ancient history at this point. But we never had LA smog problems and right now Texas leads the country in toxic waste dumps. Hell Abbott was openly advocating for Texas to be a nuclear waste dump. Texas is by far the most polluted state currently. They don't believe in regulation of pollution, claim its communism.

2086,"Highlights:

&gt; Near Chatham-Kent, Ont., a man is selling two pieces of land underneath Lake Erie.
What could a buyer do with it? In one listing, the realtor says there are ‚Äúendless possibilities.‚Äù Experts disagree. Why did the owner buy it? He didn‚Äôt realize what he was getting into.
About three years ago, Joe Cher bought two underwater lots from the municipality of Chatham-Kent, roughly three hours west of Toronto. One, in Shrewsbury, Ont., is 19 acres, the other is a square kilometre in Wheatley, Ont.

&gt; ‚ÄúI thought they were partially underwater, I only found out after purchasing them they were (fully) underwater,‚Äù Cher said. ‚ÄúI blame myself. I had to do more due diligence. Who am I going to hold responsible, the city? I‚Äôd never win.‚Äù

&gt; And what can you do with an underwater lot? Not much, experts say, noting any buyers with grand ambitions are likely to find themselves in a financial, logistical and regulatory nightmare.
&gt; ‚ÄúYou lose 99.9 per cent of buyers as soon as they find out it‚Äôs underwater,‚Äù said Cher. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm sure somebody has the right plan for it. I‚Äôm getting lots of inquiries. When they‚Äôre interested, we direct them to the city to make sure they can do what they have in mind. Then they can come back and give us an offer.‚Äù
Tim Byrne, chief administrative officer of the Essex Region Conservation Authority, which manages natural resources, such as water, in the area, said doing anything at all with the properties poses several logistical problems.
Firstly, the lots are entirely underwater ‚Äî they don‚Äôt come with ownership of any of the nearby dry land ‚Äî meaning the buyer wouldn‚Äôt be able to access their boat, if they chose to anchor it there.

&gt; Given the term ‚Äúpresently underwater‚Äù in the listing, Byrne said someone might be attracted to the land thinking there could be a way to remove the water from the lot.
But any notion the lots could be dried is technologically preposterous, he said, adding he thinks that kind of listing shouldn‚Äôt be allowed.
‚ÄúThere are certain areas that a simply not appropriate for development,‚Äù he said.
When asked what the municipality of Chatham-Kent anticipated a buyer would do with the two underwater lots when it sold them, it didn‚Äôt provide a clear answer."

2095,"CLEVELAND, Ohio ‚Äì FirstEnergy Corp. agreed today to pay a $230 million fine for its role in bankrolling the House Bill 6 scandal.



Prosecutors filed a deferred prosecution agreement against the company in U.S. District Court in Cincinnati. FirstEnergy is charged with conspiracy to commit honest services fraud involving what authorities called the largest bribery scandal in Ohio history.



Court filings list payments the company made to then-Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder and Samuel Randazzo, the former chairman of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio.



Neither is named, though the descriptions from the document make it clear Householder and Randazzo are the officials involved in the case. The agreement calls for the company to pay $115 million within 60 days to the U.S. Treasury.



It also must pay $115 million to the Ohio Development Service Agency‚Äôs percentage of income payment plan plus program for the benefit of Ohio electric-utility customers, according to the agreement.



‚ÄúIf the Ohio Development Service Agency‚Äôs percentage of income payment plan plus program is unable or unwilling to accept the funds, FirstEnergy Corp. shall pay the $115 million to the United States Treasury,‚Äù the document says.



Steven Sozio and James Wooley, two partners with Jones Day in Cleveland and former organized crime prosecutors, are representing FirstEnergy.



Emily Glatfelter and Matthew Singer, the federal prosecutors handling the House Bill 6 investigation, also dealt with the FirstEnergy agreement. Prosecutors and the FBI are expected to detail the charge in a press conference later this morning.



Coincidentally, FirstEnergy is hosting its second-quarter earnings call Friday morning.



In April, the company announced that it had begun working with federal prosecutors in Cincinnati on an agreement, which allows companies to pay large fines and cooperate to avoid criminal charges.



Last year, federal prosecutors accused FirstEnergy of paying more than $60 million in bribes to Householder and four allies to pass House Bill 6, which offered a $1 billion bailout of two aging nuclear plants off Lake Erie.



Householder, his strategist Jeffrey Longstreth and lobbyists Neil Clark, Juan Cespedes and Matthew Borges were indicted on racketeering charges. Cespedes and Longstreth have pleaded guilty. Clark died March 15 of suicide.



Householder and Borges have denied the charges, and they are expected to go to trial next year.



Federal authorities said FirstEnergy and an affiliate funneled the $60 million through a nonprofit prosecutors said Householder secretly controlled. The money went toward helping Householder gain his leadership position and to help push the bill into law.



It‚Äôs not uncommon for corporations facing criminal charges to enter into deferred prosecution agreements to avoid being charged. Commonwealth Edison Company, an Illinois utility, entered into one in 2020 to settle bribery allegations, agreeing to pay a $200 million fine.



Simultaneously, the Justice Department filed a single criminal charge against ComEd, agreeing to dismiss it after three years if the company fully cooperated with its investigation."

2104,"Ticks weren't around much when we were kids because of the colder climate here. They were always a problem down south where winters are mild. Since the climate has warmed they've been moving North, starting at the most southern parts of the north shore of Lake Erie. My vet showed me a tick tracking map that members of the Ontario Veterinary Assoc.  had been compiling in recent years, based on ticks they were pulling off dogs during appointments. The concentration of 'pins' around Point Pelee/Leamington was just a solid black mass, then you see it migrating and thinning out along the shoreline and moving north and inland. This was about ten years ago, when we took our dog in with a huge bloated tick stuck to its lip. We'd never encountered one before (this was in the GTHA) but in the ensuing years they've become more and more common and these days, since we're daily hikers on nature trails, it's almost a daily occurrence to find a tick or two on us after a hike - especially in late Spring/early Summer. Ticks don't like really hot weather. They move down to the ground in July/August, but become more active again in the Fall, so stay diligent until temps drop below 7C."

Lots of good happening on all fronts but we could do a lot better if everyone got in the habit of talking about it more often and holding industry accountable as well as ourselves. Bringing an extra empty trash bag to the beach and filling it while you enjoy your day is an easy way to help out the places you do really enjoy. We have made that a habit to not leave the beach until our bag is full, sadly sometimes we can fill it in about 5 minutes or less."

 &gt;The Cuyahoga River ( KY-…ô-HOG-…ô, or  KY-…ô-HOH-g…ô ) is a river in the United States, located in Northeast Ohio, that bisects the City of Cleveland and feeds into Lake Erie. As Cleveland emerged as a major manufacturing center, the river became heavily affected by industrial pollution, so much so that it ""caught fire"" at least 13 times, most famously on June 22, 1969, helping to spur the American environmental movement. Since then, the river has been extensively cleaned up through the efforts of Cleveland's city government and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA).

2174,"We joke about lake Ontario being where the Simpsons fish lives. Most of the great lakes are polluted. Hell, parts of lake Erie burst into flames. A lake. On fire."
2175,The same might be able to be said about having swam in Lake Erie.
2176,Lake Erie?
2177,"Factory Farms are a pox on the earth, it is past time they are held to account.
.....
&gt;‚ÄúWe did our research and we learned the main pollution is factory farms. There are 25 million animals on these factory farms and their waste is going untreated into the lake,‚Äù said Textoris.

.....

&gt;Textoris tells 19 News that Ohio needs to decrease this pollution by 40% in order to save Lake Erie.

&gt;‚ÄúPart of the issue is that the United States EPA is not enforcing the clean water act in Ohio, and so Lake Erie Advocates has taken them to court to get them to enforce. We‚Äôre trying to use the courts, we‚Äôre trying to use legislation,‚Äù said Textoris.

&gt;Until then, the only thing we have for now to save Lake Erie is our voices."
2178,"But I can swim in Lake Erie when it‚Äôs 64 degrees, just had 500,000 gallons of raw sewage overflowed into the lake directly next to the beach lol"
2179,"I live near Lake Erie and growing up the only kind of wildlife I would find would be the remains of fish and algae that covered the whole thing. Recently there‚Äôs been more live fish, and it‚Äôs been a bit cleaned up, but it‚Äôs still bad. So this is highly seconded from the Canadian side of the lake"
2180,That's funny because I've heard that Lake Erie and Ohio ARE toilets.
2181,"Ontario is the lowest lake in the Great Lakes system, meaning all pollutants from the upper lakes can theoretically  flow into Ontario. Both Ontario and Erie were historically worse than all the other Great Lakes. Plus Bullheads are a species of catfish that are known for being a trashcan in terms of eating anything including raw sewage. Suckers are also know for eating just about anything. Problem is when larger fish eat these smaller fish with these pollutants in them.

*edit: I feel me saying ""all pollutants can theoretically flow from the upper lakes to Lake Ontario"" can be misinterpreted to mean ALL pollutants from the upper lakes will flow into Lake Ontario and Lake Erie, I was simply saying Ontario and Erie are most likely to be the most polluted of the Great Lakes based on that they are the lowest lying of the lakes, and most populated."
2182,"Ohio has 300 miles of shore along Lake Erie, which is connected directly to the Atlantic through the great lakes seaway system.

Lots of beaches in that frontage, too (though they're all a bit sad)."

2189,Given the line 5 stuff along with how Lake Erie has always been treated I think we have a definitive answer on that.
2190,the warmest water in Lake Erie.
2191,I think Lake Erie counts as not land locked
2192,"In fairness - the throw-away mention of we tend to just fuck things up worse when we try to fix them isn't entirely true - really depends on how cleanup is defined &amp; who is doing it - you're likely right overall, but if done right we're super good at it.   

Personal/anecdotal life experience - have lived most of my life in northeastern Ohio/ Western PA. I was born mid 1980's - growing up, any outdoor water recreation was pools, manmade lakes, and natural lakes used for drinking water. The areas river systems and Lake Erie were still just fucked. 

I forget when it changed from ""it's not safe to eat fish from Lake Erie"" to like ""You can eat like 2 fish from Lake Erie a month without consuming dangerous amounts of mercury""... but yeah - that was totally a thing, and not that long ago.

Honestly at one point I think everything everywhere in this area was just one giant steel mill - hell - one of the Cuyahoga River's (many) fires served as a rallying cry for increasing social interest in environmentalism that led to the creation of the EPA.

EPA superfund sites are the first example of cleanup done well I'd like to toss out there - in the interest of brevity - [their list of completed projects is cool](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-success-stories). 

As to the river systems in this area - the transformation just in my lifetime is hard to believe - wasn't just the Cuyahoga that caught fire - river fires were common all over the place. Mahoning River burned a number of times... In my childhood like our parents would say don't swim in them - but even as kids &amp; kids do dumb shit was unnecessary, many still looked, just awful - I mean they were dead in many places still. Today?most all are safe/clean/thriving and used for recreation now.

The ingredients for successful cleanup are simple - both the superfund sites &amp; the smaller efforts to clean up area waterways that have been shockingly effective  follow basically the same pattern.

Bring the polluter, environmentalist to serve to keep polluter honest, some level of government to serve as the enforcement mechanism &amp; possible partial source of funding, and the situationally appropriate scientists - who take baseline samples to establish problem, a system to monitor the problem, and what the target goals for these are the numbers needed for the biome to recover to the point it's functional again, and what the numbers need to be for the effort to be considered complete &amp; successful. 

Don't leave the table till there's a plan for how to extract pollutants, a plan for how it's being paid for. A plan for how monitoring will work and penalties for non compliance. One those are agreed upon it just takes time 

In my lifetime I've watched that turn dead, disgusting, dangerous rivers polluted beyond comprehension for 100+ years of industry that treated them like trashcan in my 35ish years of paying attention to them. Which - pretty wild if you think about it - most of that time was spent getting things to the point where the ecosystem could return to minimal functionality - once that happened the pace of cleanup increased exponentially, nature is really good at cleaning up after us when not totally fucking broken."

I dont know if all this applies or is what you're looking for, but the biggest change I've seen in my lifetime is visible, undeniable evidence of climate change. No longer do we have mild dry summers. It's so hot and humid. Also the amount of storms that produce flooding are increasing drastically, especially in Niagara County and around Chautauqua county, coming off Lake Erie. Shoreline erosion on Lake Ontario is also increasing in severity.
Lake Erie takes longer and longer to freeze over, increasing the likelihood of more intense lake effect snow events and likely having effects of the lakes ecosystem. 
There's also been an strong uptick of invasive species(plant and animal) in the last 5ish years. I've watched it kill, choke out and change our landscape.
All this going on and a general sense of apathy by the large majority."

2251,"The Lake Effect weather patterns and geographic placement of the lakes affect us year round. But also changes in the global environment as a whole have impacted how much rain and snow the Buffalo and surrounding areas get. 

For example I livd up in the Northtowns, in Niagara County, in between Lake Ontario and Lake Erie. Most of the storms in the summer and winter not associated with a major front will typically blow South or North of here. That's been especially true this summer where it's been hot and humid but, everything is just super dry otherwise due to the lack of rain. 

Climate change wise, we used to get a lot more freak / pop-up rainstorms in the summer, which have been mostly missing us. That's more of a climate change thing with the Air being able to hold more moisture (due to heat) but also due to some vegetation (Ash and Maple trees) getting diseased and infested, dying off, and decreasing transpiration."

2255," "" In the mid-‚Äô90s, industrial agriculture gained a foothold in the lake‚Äôs 8,000 square-mile western basin which drains mostly via the Maumee River at Toledo. 

Some 25,000,000 cows, chickens and pigs are now confined in factory ‚Äúfarms,‚Äù or more accurately, animal feeding factories.

They choke on noxious fumes of their own waste, are crowded together making antibiotic-laced feed necessary to prevent disease and live a miserable existence no sentient creature should have to endure.  Just one side effect of this system is the rising occurrence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Small wonder when 80% of antibiotic usage in the U.S. is in animal feed and 98% of meat eaten in this country is produced in these factories.

Something else happens in these enormous sheds located behind earth berms or set back far from the road that military veterans will recognize. Conditions in them dehumanize workers just as surely as they brutalize the animals. Covertly recorded videotapes expose crimes against humane animal laws reminiscent of soldiers committing crimes against humanity and the Geneva Conventions.

Decades after my own military experience during the Vietnam war, I took up the cause of Lake Erie and began to also research the reality of industrial animal production. I was familiar with the fact that animals were inhumanely housed but it wasn‚Äôt until I saw footage of workers cruelly abusing animals that I made the connection with war. """

It seems like lakes have to stay warm for a while to grow a dangerous population of the amoeba. Of course, climate change makes historic data less reliable.

People in Lackawana couldn't hang their close to dry without them turning orange. My dad used to tell me when the got back from fishing they would have to wash the boat off with gasoline to get the orange off. Companies like the steel plant and many others dumped their slag and other waste directly into the lake.

For the lake as a whole, about 10x as much comes from agriculture as from waste-water plants. 

For runoff directly into Burlington Bay, its about 60-40 between the WWTF and storm-water runoff.

It could also seep into the ground and into water tables for 5 US states and the Province of Ontario effecting about 20 million people, potentially making losing there a severe health hazard.

The Great Lakes contain 25% of the worlds fresh water.  

A crude oil spill will not be able to be cleaned up sufficiently, if at all.

Harmful algal blooms (HABs), especially of the Cyanobacteria variety (commonly called blue-green algae, but are not actually plants), are a legit threat to not just drinking water supplies but also most aquatic ecosystems. The term ‚Äúeutrophication‚Äù is used to describe the process of increased nutrient concentrations resulting in increased primary production. The issue is more primary production in the form of HABs ends up destroying the previous base of the ecosystem and causes a cascade effect through the rest of the food chain.

2293,"&gt;All right: Even if we concede that full private property in resources and the free market will conserve and create resources, and do it far better than government regulation, what of the problem of pollution? Wouldn't we be suffering aggravated pollution from unchecked ""capitalist greed""?  
There is, first of all, this stark empirical fact: Government ownership, even socialism, has proved to be no solution to the problem of pollution. Even the most starry-eyed proponents of government planning concede that the poisoning of Lake Baikal in the Soviet Union is a monument to heedless industrial pollution of a valuable natural resource. But there is far more to the problem than that. Note, for example, the two crucial areas in which pollution has become an important problem: the air and the waterways, particularly the rivers. But these are precisely two of the vital areas in society in which private property has not been permitted to function.  
First, the rivers. The rivers, and the oceans too, are generally owned by the government; private property, certainly complete private property, has not been permitted in the water. In essence, then, government owns the rivers. But government ownership is not true ownership, because the government officials, while able to control the resource cannot themselves reap their capital value on the market. Government officials cannot sell the rivers or sell stock in them. Hence, they have no economic incentive to preserve the purity and value of the rivers. Rivers are, then, in the economic sense, ""unowned""; therefore government officials have permitted their corruption and pollution. Anyone has been able to dump polluting garbage and wastes in the waters. But consider what would happen if private firms were able to own the rivers and the lakes. If a private firm owned Lake Erie, for example, then anyone dumping garbage in the lake would be promptly sued in the courts for their aggression against private property and would be forced by the courts to pay damages and to cease and desist from any further aggression. Thus, only private property rights will insure an end to pollution ‚Äî invasion of resources. Only because the rivers are unowned is there no owner to rise up and defend his precious resource from attack. If, in contrast, anyone should dump garbage or pollutants into a lake which is privately owned (as are many smaller lakes), he would not be permitted to do so for very long ‚Äî the owner would come roaring to its defense.

2294,How did they get rid of them in Lake Erie?
2295,"They didn't. Lake Erie is loaded with zebra mussels. There are dunes along the shore completely made of zebra mussel shells. 

There has been a pattern of shifting from extremely high densities of small individuals, 120k per square meter, to lower densities of larger individuals. It's been seen in many locations where they have been introduced. Causes are debated by its likely a decrease in the amount of available food and substrate. 

As far as I'm aware there are no large bodies of water that have eliminated zebra mussels once they have been established."
2296,"I drove down from the GTA to the Niagara area to go cycling along the Welland Canal. Originally I was gonna ride all the way to Port Colborne on Lake Erie, but the trail was under construction."
2297,"I feel so bad for our Lake Erie Bros.

They deserve so much better than the heartbreak they constantly get."
2298,"I feel for you, Lake Erie bros"
2299,"I have been to lake Michigan and lake Erie, I have also been to the Atlantic ocean. Lakes even big ones and oceans are very different things."
2300,"I'm judging pollution by literally the levels of pollution. Heavy metal quantities, TMDLs, etc. There's no comparison. These things are HIGHLY regulated and monitored. If I take a shit in a stream coming off a mine, it's going to get picked up on water testing. There isn't significant downstream habitat degradation or biodiversity changes due to mining in the USA in the current day."
2301,"De troit is 'the strait.' (the Detroit River, which the city is named after, is a strait between Lake St. Clair and Lake Erie)"
2302,Pennsylvania ? Delaware River? Ohio River? Susquehanna River?Lake Erie ?
2303,"Summers are fantastic! It really is nice. Sometimes the humidity gets up there but not like FL, SC, NC, GA, etc. Temps are pretty mild with average of 80s and sometimes into the 90s. Very rare into the 100s. Around August till first frost Ragweed pollen can flare up. No wildfires. We are a days drive from everything where it be going south to KY, TN or west to Chicago, or east to NY or DC. Also MI is probably my favorite. The beaches are so beautiful, the forests, etc. There is so much to explore and do. Closer to here I go to the Lake Erie beaches in May and June. By July and August sometimes you get water advisories due to algea and eColi."
2304,"Eh, more that it *does* have a taste, but you just stop noticing it after awhile. Like, in my area, the tap water is pretty good most of the year (WNY)n but I do notice a very faint algae taste in late summer, particularly if Lake Erie got warmer than usual."
2305,Plus they showed the Great Lakes. Lake Erie? Close?
2306,"I grew up in NW Ohio, which is home to a lot of pig farms.  The farmers used to take the ""poo"" &amp; spread it on their crops, as a way to fertilize the crops &amp; get rid of the poo.  What has happened in the last 10 years is this poo has caused Lake Erie to shut down because of runoff into streams &amp; rivers.  This led to several large alge booms on Lake Erie, closing Toledo's water supply off."

2309,"[On September 27, 1986](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloonfest_%2786), the nonprofit United Way released around 1.5 million balloons in Cleveland, Ohio to try to get the world record for most balloons released at one time as part of a fundraising event. They got the world record but the balloons drifted all over the city and into Lake Erie, causing problems with traffic in town and at the local airport. Additionally, two boaters on the lake drowned due to the Coast Guard having difficulty telling what was a brightly colored balloon and what was a life vest. The city and organizers got sued for damages and the cost of all the lawsuits exceeded the amount of money the event had raised in the first place."
2310,"My position as a hydrogeophysics field research tech came as the result of state funding to clean up lake erie, and I believe the number of similar positions is steadily growing. My work is mostly soil and water sampling with some geophysics mixed in. Maybe search for something like that?"
2311,"Ohio is one of the worst states when it comes to water pollution. We sit on Lake Erie and it‚Äôs too polluted for people to use. I have to go out of state to find a place to swim. This is unacceptable. It also harms the diversity of fish and amphibians, which are on the decline. 

Organic farming can help prevent harmful fertilizer and pesticides from running off in to the lakes and water sources. 

Environmental crimes such as illegally dumping waste products and hazardous materials will have severely harsh consequences. Employees who report illegal activities in the companies will be rewarded as long as the investigation confirms their claims. The Ohio EPA will be given more power to enforce these acts.

Wind and solar power sources will be tried out in smaller towns and be implemented in smaller cities. 

Our cities need to become more than just concrete jungles. We need cities that can support, rather than destroy, the ecosystem. People tend to be happier when they are within reach of nature. People in the cities shouldn‚Äôt have to drive 15 to 20 minutes to find all the beautiful things Ohio has to offer. We will also encourage cities to put more funding in to public gardens. That way, everyone has access to fresh produce. Cities should also plant flowers that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
2312,"You have my vote; I would also love to see these kinds of measures taken in other states (although I know you have no control of what happens there). One question though, do you want to work with me (if we get elected) to help clean Lake Erie."
2313,Wow this is floodwaters and it‚Äôs still fucking cleaner than the lake I live by. Lake Erie. Check out that dirty motherfucker
2314,Lake Erie is super polluted but it's actually clearer than it's supposed to be in a lot of areas. The invasive zebra mussels basically filter the water and clear it out. Half the beach in some places when I was a kid was crushed zebra mussel shells. But a lot of the native fish only like the muck and they can't handle the clear water.
2315,"Yeah you gotta be careful anywhere, sometimes after a rain you don't even want to go swimming even where I'm at now in HI, but particularly lake erie when there's a bacteria warning lol. I swam in it every summer and turned out fine though."

2322,"Balloonfest '86. 

Meant to be a fundraiser in Cleveland, Ohio, it set a world record for simultaneous release of balloons. It also caused multiple traffic collisions, interfered with a Coast Guard search, shut down the airport for a period of time, and sent balloons washing ashore in Canada, because Lake Erie.

Quite literally, it is the reason that Guinness Book of World Records doesn't measure events that are environmentally unsound."
2323,"A tip of the cap to you, Lake Erie"
2324,"[balloon fest 1986](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloonfest_'86)

Balloonfest '86 was a 1986 event in Cleveland, Ohio, United States, in which the local chapter of United Way set a world record by releasing almost one-and-a-half million balloons.[2] The event was intended to be a harmless fundraising publicity stunt, but the balloons drifted back over the city, Lake Erie, and landed in the surrounding area, causing problems for traffic and a nearby airport. The event also interfered with a United States Coast Guard search for two boaters who were later found drowned.[1] In consequence, the organizers and the city faced lawsuits seeking millions of dollars in damages,[1] and cost overruns put the event at a net loss.[3]"

2326,Big boy! Looks absolutely gorgeous there. We pull monsters off lake erie tributaries but you know... pollution. You win!
2327,"It is currently being fixed but the timescales of these issues take 40-75 years to see any measurable change... Low water and warm summer also has exasperated these issues on these reservoirs in the central part of the state. Wisconsin River TMDL was created for a reason now we just need to get the farmers more onboard for changing and adapting new practices and BMPs for their land management. There is also a lot of legacy TP in those systems left from decades of poor land use and management, etc..."
2328,Lake Erie..
2329,"Lake Erie is shallower than Lake Michigan, and so it gets warmer in the summers.

Water quality varies, and there are water quality alerts some days that will prevent you from swimming (like from algae bloom).

Lakefront development is much more limited in terms of parks and paths, but there are still beaches and marinas and docks and the like, so all of the water sports and whatnot are available."
2330,Yeah Lake Erie is still relatively dirty. Doesn‚Äôt stop me and they do test water at most beaches but for instance after storms the stuff that washes up is depressing.
2331,The big ten is connected if you count Lake Erie
2332,"Is mercury and PCB pollution a problem in Lake Erie?  I suppose it should be from all the urban rivers flowing into the Great Lakes system, but I don‚Äôt know how bad it is in the lake itself."
2333,"I‚Äôm just really not interested in going back and forth with someone who actually believes that spraying poisons that kill things and pollute water and break down fibers of living beings on a cellular level doesn‚Äôt have a negative impact on game animals resulting in negative impacts on humans. Anyone with the most basic 9th grade biology D- can see how it‚Äôs not good. I will slightly agree with you and admit the dangers may not be as bad as some believe. It‚Äôs a domino line of problems creating other problems and potentially dangerous situations. Just like the fact that the company who sell and developed glyphosate also owns the only seeds that can grow while their product is applied. You don‚Äôt see the conflict there at all maybe even a little? They don‚Äôt give a rats ass if the food they grow is healthy all they care about is money. It‚Äôs practically a monopoly with the agriculture companies but these companies have big money ties with big corporate brands and politicians so it goes on, just like a lot of other things that are corrupt in this country. A huge portion of people who hunt hunt because they want clean organic food. What‚Äôs the point of hunting when the game we pursue is no longer organic from grazing gmo and spray filled fields and drinking water from streams and ponds with glyphosate in it. There‚Äôs better, cleaner and safer ways to deal with weeds in a field than spraying glyphosate all over. I live right on Lake Erie. The agriculture run off is the #1 detriment to the Great Lakes right now. The glyphosate contains phosphorus it gets into the water a toxic algae feeds off it and thrives suffocates the fish and has tainted drinking water. Even if glyphosate didn‚Äôt have an effect on the deer you couldn‚Äôt convince me it‚Äôs a good thing to use for human safety and natural resource purposes. I live with the first hand negative effects every day.

2347,As in lake Erie?
2348,"This is the Cuyahoga running into Lake Erie. The Cuyahoga caught fire in 1969 (for the 13th time), a disaster that had a hand in the creation of the EPA. 

&gt; Cleveland, OH was once known as a major industrial center within the United States.  As the 1960s came to an end, so did the country's reliance on industrialized manufacturing.  However, Cleveland continued production which when paired with a lack in sewer and waste disposal regulation maintained the littering of the Cuyahoga River.  On June 22, 1969, around 12pm, floating pieces of oil slicked debris were ignited on the river by sparks caused by a passing train.  Specifically, following an investigation, the cause was determined to be the oily debris trapped beneath two wooden trestles, rigid support frames, located around the Campbell Rd. hill in Southeast Cleveland.  The fire was determined to have reached heights of over five stories and lasted between twenty and thirty minutes.  There was reported to be around $50,000 of damages including: $45,000 from the destruction of the bridge owned by Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Co. and $5,000 from the Newburgh &amp; South Shore Railway trestle. 

&gt; The Cuyahoga River was once one of the most polluted rivers in the United States as represented by the multitude of times it has caught fire, a recorded number of thirteen starting in 1868.  The most potent blaze occurred in 1952 which caused over $1.3 million in damages however, the most fatal fire happened in 1912 with a documented five deaths.  The 1969 fire, which did not incur maximum damages or fatally wound any citizen, was the most covered incident occuring on the river.  This was in part because of the developing precedence that sanitation held over industrial actions; the United States was becoming more eco-aware.  Also, due to the shift from industry to technology, waste dumping to recycling Time Magazine produced an article about the incident.  This brought mass amount of attention to the Cleveland area and added pressure for hygienic regulation.

&gt; Inspired by the 1969 river fire, Congress was determined to resolve the issue of land pollution, not just in Cleveland, but throughout the United States.  The legislature passed the National Environment Policy Act (NEPA) which was signed into law on January 1, 1970.  This act helped establish the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) which would be given the duties to manage environmental risks and regulate various sanitary-specific policies.  One of the first legislations that the EPA put-forth was the Clean Water Act (1972), which mandated that all rivers throughout the United States be hygienic enough to safely allow mass amounts of swimmers and fish within the water by 1983.  Since the 1969 Cuyahoga River fire the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District has invested over $3.5 billion towards the purification of the river and the development of new sewer systems.  There is a projection that over the next thirty years the city of Cleveland will further endow over $5 billion to the upkeep of the wastewater system.  The river is now home to about sixty different species of fish, there has not been another river fire since 1969, and yearly new waste management programs develop to ensure the sanitation of Cleveland's waterways.   

[From Ohio History Central](http://ohiohistorycentral.org/w/Cuyahoga_River_Fire)"
2349,"Both. This looks like the port of Cleveland, there is industry that runs along on the cuyahoga river which dumps into Lake Erie. That river is why we have the EPA because it caught on fire numerous times and destroyed Cleveland's fishing industry. 

Now Cleveland is doing much better, and the fishing industry has been restored as the lake  is no longer declared ""dead"".

This conflicts very strongly with the right and with the Republican party. Republicans want to deregulate the economy, including the sorts of things that we put in place to stop Lake Erie from catching on fire, or to dissuade corporations like Johnson &amp; Johnson from [putting asbestos in baby powder.](https://www.democracynow.org/2021/10/22/headlines/j_j_spinoff_company_files_for_bankruptcy_to_stem_damage_from_talcum_powder_cancer_lawsuits) At the same time, they want to put in a bunch of restrictions on non-harmful things people do, like being transgender or gay. And they think that helping other people is best left to private groups, [groups that discriminate against people.](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/12/16/21003560/salvation-army-anti-lgbtq-controversies-donations)

The Democrats aren't a great match either. They aren't keen on the duty to help others. They are lukewarm on deregulating people's personal lives and establishing protections."
2357,"**[Cuyahoga River](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuyahoga_River)** 
 
 &gt;The Cuyahoga River ( KY-…ô-HOG-…ô, or  KY-…ô-HOH-g…ô ) is a river in the United States, located in Northeast Ohio, that bisects the City of Cleveland and feeds into Lake Erie. As Cleveland emerged as a major manufacturing center, the river became heavily affected by industrial pollution, so much so that it ""caught fire"" at least 13 times, most famously on June 22, 1969, helping to spur the American environmental movement. Since then, the river has been extensively cleaned up through the efforts of Cleveland's city government and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA).

2391,"In the Mentor headlands, which is a suburb of Cleveland Ohio there was an industrial accident at the Morton salt plant. I don't know when it happened but when I lived there in the seventies as a kid it was already old news.

Morton was mining salt from the bottom of lake Erie and something went wrong, Morton claims it was vandalism, and huge amounts of brine were dumped into a nearby swamp. Naturally everything died. Driving over the bridge from Mentor to the headlands was an eerie experience because it was just dead tree trunks covered by thick fog.

The worst part was that the area was quickly populated with an invasive species of saltwater mosquito that carry malaria. No one else in that part of the world has to worry about malaria but the people around Mentor did."

&gt; Fish flies, also known as mayflies, descend in droves around June each year in places that border Lake St. Clair, Lake Erie, the St. Clair River and the Detroit River. 

&gt; The pests gather in swarms on screen doors, car windshields, boats, gas station pumps, ATM machines, streetlights ‚Äî pretty much any available surface. Residents say they turn white cars and boats brown. They reek of fish if they get wet. Their carcasses crunch beneath tires and shoes, and make streets as slick as ice. 

I remember them filling the gutter next to the curb on every street... the stuff left over after they molted."

2395,"It can be tricky. I lived near a treatment plant in Michigan and also on Lake Erie and they would have to send out workers to scrape them off the bars as they would cluster so bad it could mess with the water intake. So it might help solve an issue but could create another issue. Do we have enough wildlife in IA that would eat them? Would they become a pest in the long run that we cant get rid of? What about boats? Do rental places need to hire extra help to scrape them off? Iowa used to have about 55 species of mussels but its around 25 ish now, so what was the cause in decline? Is our water to polluted for them to live? If so that could be waisted money right there."
2396,"OK, I think I understand now. In reality, there isn't much threat to humans. The threat is really to the integrity of the ecosystem and to the species that inhabit it. 

The potential threat to humans occurs after oxygen is depleted. At that point, the chemistry changes and anoxic chemical reactions occur that often release nutrients like phosphorus from lake sediments. That fuels algal blooms, and, when nutrients are high enough and other conditions are correct, harmful algal blooms. These harmful algal blooms are toxic to humans and wildlife. 

As an example, Lake Erie regularly goes anoxic (zero oxygen) in its deep waters each summer. The lake also gets some pretty serious harmful algal blooms. The city of Toledo, OH, had to shut down the drinking water intake to \~400,000 people a few years ago due to high toxins from the harmful algal blooms in the lake. So there can be a human health impact, but it is not from low oxygen in the water. It is from the knock-on effects that occur after oxygen is depleted. 

How to deal with that? Well, folks in Toledo had to drink bottled water for a few days."

Harmful algal blooms are a health hazard in all 50 states. But Lake Erie, the shallowest, and therefore the warmest, of the five Great Lakes, is uniquely vulnerable to algal blooms.

Of the big lake they called Gitche Gumee
The lake, it is said, never gives up her dead
When the skies of November turn gloomy
With a load of iron ore twenty-six thousand tons more
Than the Edmund Fitzgerald weighed empty
That good ship and true was a bone to be chewed
When the gales of November came early

The ship was the pride of the American side
Coming back from some mill in Wisconsin
As the big freighters go, it was bigger than most
With a crew and good captain well seasoned
Concluding some terms with a couple of steel firms
When they left fully loaded for Cleveland
And later that night when the ship's bell rang
Could it be the north wind they'd been feelin'?

The wind in the wires made a tattle-tale sound
And a wave broke over the railing
And every man knew, as the captain did too
T'was the witch of November come stealin'
The dawn came late and the breakfast had to wait
When the gales of November came slashin'
When afternoon came it was freezin' rain
In the face of a hurricane west wind

When suppertime came, the old cook came on deck sayin'
""Fellas, it's too rough to feed ya""
At seven PM, a main hatchway caved in, he said
""Fellas, it's been good to know ya""
The captain wired in he had water comin' in
And the good ship and crew was in peril
And later that night when his lights went outta sight
Came the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald

Does any one know where the love of God goes
When the waves turn the minutes to hours?
The searchers all say they'd have made Whitefish Bay
If they'd put fifteen more miles behind her
They might have split up or they might have capsized
They may have broke deep and took water
And all that remains is the faces and the names
Of the wives and the sons and the daughters

Lake Huron rolls, Superior sings
In the rooms of her ice-water mansion
Old Michigan steams like a young man's dreams
The islands and bays are for sportsmen
And farther below Lake Ontario
Takes in what Lake Erie can send her
And the iron boats go as the mariners all know
With the gales of November remembered

In a musty old hall in Detroit they prayed
In the maritime sailors' cathedral
The church bell chimed 'til it rang twenty-nine times
For each man on the Edmund Fitzgerald
The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down
Of the big lake they called Gitche Gumee
Superior, they said, never gives up her dead
When the gales of November come early"

2414,"Steht in dem Paper, aber hier nochmal zitiert:

&gt; The threat to avian wildlife from nuclear power plants can be divided into upstream and downstream fatalities.

&gt; Upstream, uranium milling and mining can poison and kill hundreds of birds per facility per year. Abandoned open pit uranium mines in Wyoming have formed lakes hazardous to wildlife. Uranium-bearing formations are usually associated with strata containing high concentrations of selenium. For example, one of these pits killed 300 birds during a single year (US Fish and Wildlife Service 2008). Presuming this rate stayed constant, deaths at this mine therefore correlate to about 0.45 deaths per GWh.

&gt; Like fossil-fueled power stations and wind farms, avian fauna can also collide with nuclear power plants. Three thousand birds died in two successive nights in 1982 from collisions with cooling towers at Florida Power Corporation's Crystal River Generating Facility (Maehr et al. 1983). Given that the power plant now hosts an 838-MW nuclear reactor, and presuming it operated with a capacity factor of 90% and that the 3000 deaths were the only ones throughout the year, the facility was responsible for 0.454 avian deaths per GWh. Ornithologists observed 274 fatal bird collisions with an elevated cooling tower at the Limerick nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania from 1979 to 1980 (Veltri and Klem 2005). Since the Limerick plant has a 1200-MW reactor, and also assuming it operated at a 90% capacity factor, it was responsible for 0.261 deaths per GWh. At the Susquehanna plant in eastern Pennsylvania, 1500 dead birds were collected between 1978 and 1986 for an average of 187 fatalities per year (Biewald 2005). Assuming that the 2200 MW plant operated at 90% capacity factor, it was responsible for 0.01 deaths per GWh. Extensive surveys for dead birds were also conducted at the Davis-Bess nuclear plant near Lake Erie in Northern Ohio. Ornithologists recorded a total of 1554 bird fatalities or an average of 196 per year from 1972 to 1979 (Biewald 2005). Given that the power plant hosts an 873-MW reactor, and assuming it operated with a 90% capacity factor, and the plant was responsible for 0.0285 fatalities per GWh. Taking the mean for each of the four power plants results in 0.188 deaths per GWh.

&gt; The total avian deaths per GWh for nuclear power plants are therefore about 0.638."

&gt; The Biden administration is set to toss out President Donald Trump‚Äôs efforts to scale back the number of streams, marshes and other wetlands that fall under federal protection, kicking off a legal and regulatory scuffle over the fate of wetlands and waterways around the country, from the arid West to the swampy South.

&gt; Michael Regan, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, said his team determined that the Trump administration‚Äôs rollback is ‚Äúleading to significant environmental degradation.‚Äù The EPA and Army Corps of Engineers will now craft a new set of protections for waterways that provide habitats for wildlife and safe drinking water for millions of Americans, according to a joint statement.

&gt; With the announcement, the Biden administration is wading into a decades-long battle over how far federal officials can go to stop contaminants from entering small streams and other wetlands.

&gt; ‚ÄúCommunities deserve to have our nation‚Äôs waters protected,‚Äù said Jaime A. Pinkham, acting assistant secretary of the Army for civil works.

&gt; In 2015, the Obama administration expanded federal authority to stop or curtail development that could harm a variety of wetlands, streams and ditches that feed into larger bodies of water protected under the Clean Water Act.

&gt; Heeding the call of home developers, oil drillers and growers who saw the restrictions as detrimental to their livelihoods, the Trump administration rolled back those Obama-era pollution controls.

&gt; But critics, including a panel of independent scientists picked by the Trump administration itself, slammed the move for potentially hastening the destruction of waterways, including ‚Äúephemeral‚Äù streams that appear only after rainfall and help purify water on its way to larger lakes and rivers that serve as sources of drinking water for millions of Americans. The current lack of protections is particularly notable in dry states such as New Mexico and Arizona, the EPA said.

&gt; ‚ÄúThe science says those streams and these wetlands are an important part of our clean-water system in the United States and should be protected,‚Äù said Tom Kiernan, head of American Rivers, a conservation group.

&gt; Now, Regan says he‚Äôs trying to strike the delicate balance between conservation and development that both the Trump and Obama administrations failed to reach.

&gt; ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve learned lessons from both, we‚Äôve seen complexities in both, and we‚Äôve determined both rules did not necessarily listen to the will of the people,‚Äù Regan told House lawmakers in April.

&gt; The Biden administration‚Äôs rulemaking could help stem the staggering loss of wetlands.

&gt; Since the end of the Revolutionary War, more than half of the 221 million acres of wetlands in what would become the contiguous United States have been drained, often for farming. The rate of destruction began to wane only in recent decades.

&gt; In northwest Ohio, for instance, corn and other crops are grown on a vast tract once known as the Great Black Swamp. Farmers began draining it during the 19th century, and now agricultural runoff flows into Lake Erie and feeds the growth of toxic algae that regularly closes beaches and once forced the city of Toledo to suspend tap water use for about two days.

&gt; Bill Stanley, state director of the Nature Conservancy in Ohio, said the Trump administration‚Äôs withdrawal of federal protections for what few streams remain to filter nutrient waste from fertilizers could make the lake susceptible to even bigger algae blooms.

&gt; ‚Äú ‚ÄòNutrients‚Äô doesn‚Äôt sound like a bad word,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúbut when you get too many of them, it causes major problems for our water quality in Ohio.‚Äù

&gt; But farmers such as Daryl Lies, who raises hogs and sheep and grows vegetables on 160 acres in central North Dakota, say the Obama-era restrictions on wetland development would have been ‚Äúpainstakingly costly for agriculture.‚Äù Those rules, he said, ‚Äúwould have made it a lot harder to have the livestock‚Äù near a creek that winds along his farm on its way to the Missouri River.

&gt; ‚ÄúFarmers and ranchers are the original environmentalists, I say,‚Äù said Lies, who heads the North Dakota Farm Bureau. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not the activists, like we hear across the nation, but we are the real environmentalists. We care about taking care of our land and having it there for the next generation.‚Äù

&gt; The Trump-era rule eased the path for several construction projects, including a commercial, industrial and residential park along the Savannah River, which forms the border between South Carolina and Georgia.

&gt; The RiverPort project came with the promise of jobs in shipping and construction. But wildlife officials at the nearby Savannah National Wildlife Refuge warned in 2010 the proposal ‚Äúrepresents a significant threat‚Äù to its bottomland hardwoods of gum and maple trees and freshwater marshes that attract migrating waterfowl.

&gt; Yet after the Trump administration rolled back the Obama-era rule, more than 200 acres of the wetlands in the project‚Äôs footprint fell out of federal oversight, according to the Southern Environmental Law Center, which is suing the EPA over the regulation.

&gt; ‚ÄúEvery day the rule is in place, we are losing protections for 92 percent of wetlands, waters and streams,‚Äù said Kelly Moser, a senior attorney at the Charlottesville-based legal advocacy group, citing the organization‚Äôs analysis of the impact of the Trump rule.

&gt; In total, the EPA and Army Corps said they are aware of 333 projects that no longer require federal water permits under the Trump rule.

&gt; A former regulator from the purple state of North Carolina, Regan arrived in Washington with a reputation as a consensus builder and has spent much of his first months in office listening to both sides of the debate over water protections. Lies was among several people in North Dakota‚Äôs agriculture and oil industries Regan met with last week on a trip to Bismarck hosted by Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.).

&gt; ‚ÄúI‚Äôm cautiously optimistic that we‚Äôll be able to work with this EPA administrator and that he truly is sincere about getting out and getting input,‚Äù Lies said.

&gt; But the fate of the EPA‚Äôs effort ultimately will hang in the U.S. Supreme Court.

&gt; At the center of the decades-long legal storm over water protections is the Clean Water Act, which bans pollution in a ‚Äúwaters of the United States‚Äù without a permit. The question of what constitutes such water has been up for debate since the law‚Äôs passage in 1972.

&gt; In a 2006 decision, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote federal officials could step in when there was a ‚Äúsignificant nexus‚Äù between smaller and larger bodies of water. The Obama administration wrote its rule around that standard.

&gt; With the announcement Wednesday, the Biden administration is kicking off a lengthy rulemaking process. It must first strike down the Trump rule before setting its own definition for which waterways get federal protection.

&gt; But after Kennedy‚Äôs retirement and with the Supreme Court taking an even more conservative turn with the appointments of three justices by Trump, it‚Äôs unclear what sort of rule could now pass muster.

&gt; ‚ÄúThat is the $64 million question, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù said Patrick Parenteau, a professor of natural resources law at Vermont Law School. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs got to be a rule that gets five votes on the Supreme Court, and that‚Äôs going to be ‚Ä¶ difficult.‚Äù

PCBs from industrial pollution stay in the body longer than mercury and are proven to be a major carcinogen alongside effecting the human hormonal system. There is no proven safe level of PCB exposure. Although we not longer pollute with PCBs, they are extremely slow to break down and the bottom of lake Erie is thick with the stuff meaning it will be in the ecosystem effectively forever.

They have no mouthparts so consequentially they only live for 24-72 hours - the adult stage is purely for mating. The larva live for 2 years prior to emerging.  [Here](https://www.thebeacon.net/turn-the-lights-out-lake-eries-mayfly-hatch-a-port-clinton-happening-in-june/) is an interesting article about them:

""The 1996 hatch in Port Clinton was special. The mayflies were so thick on city streets that snow plows were used to push the spent bugs into great piles and city workers took away 97 truckloads of them""

I've been a water-man my whole life, very tragic to see all death and destruction.

The lagoon system from Martin County to Volusia County is a sewer on the east coast. It's all dying or dead already.

The Everglades are dying from lack of freshwater, and always at risk from development or gas/oil exploration. 

Lake Okeechobee is completely polluted by Big Sugar and pollutes the waters it empties into. On the east coast, it's the St. Lucie River. On the west coast, it's the Caloosahatchee River. Those surrounding areas on the coasts see fish kills, death of ecosystems and poisonous algae blooms. 

Red tide shows up on the Gulf Coast every year from summer to fall, but warm temperatures can see red tide continue into the winter months too. And it stays and lingers in the Gulf because of the lack of circulation (currents) in the Gulf of Mexico in these areas. Like a giant bathtub.

Tampa Bay was a success story. It saw regrowth of sea grass after decades of despair.

The answers to these major problems are known. Florida's Republican leadership will never commit to solving these problems. This is why I've stopped voting for Republicans completely. The Republican party forced me to the left, back in the day I was a ""centrist"". They forced me to vote exclusively about water. I'm always looking for any politician willing to clean up our waters. 

(Also, I found religion after a decade away from the church, which pushed me away from Republicans, but that's another story.)

Major problems:

Unregulated major development along every beach, every wetland, every lake, ever pond, every river, every puddle, ever retention pond, every stream, every creek, every spring

Dumping fertilizers into our waterways. Stop using fertilizer! Just flat out stop buying it or using it.

Spraying herbicides or pesticides near water. Just stop spraying. If weeds are really taking over a waterway, find another method to remove them. Manually remove it. Have an entrepreneurial capitalist come in here and figure out a great manual method to remove weeds choking out a pond or lake. They could make a fortune.

Big Sugar polluting Lake Okeechobee and estuaries on the coast with their agriculture runoff. If you're familiar with Lake Erie up north, they see something similar too ([https://greatlakes.org/campaigns/lake-erie-algae-blooms/](https://greatlakes.org/campaigns/lake-erie-algae-blooms/))

Blocking the freshwater flow of the water from Lake Okeechobee to the Everglades. Everglades needs the freshwater to survive. Everglades was known as the River of Grass ... well, let that ""river"" exist again from Lake O to the Everglades!

Septic tanks near waterways leaching their actual poop into our waterways. This is a huge issue. ALL houses and businesses near any waterway need to be on city water, so their poop and pee goes to a water cleaning station, not into our waterways. This will take major infrastructure upgrades.

Outdated infrastructure that handles poop and pee, breaking and leaking nastiness into our waterways. This will take major infrastructure upgrades.

Removing the layers of muck at the bottom of our waterways. When seagrass or plants die, they fall to the bottom and create muck. This muck prevents new growth of plants. Clear waterways turn off colored because the muck doubles as silt in our waters. Silted waters make it hard for seagrass and plants and oysters to grow.

In general, stop this hyper growth and development killing our waters and green areas. Cap growth. Force developers to help pay for infrastructure upgrades. Infrastructure needs to catch up, and at this point I don't care how it gets done.

For the rest of my life, I will vote water and vote green. And I'm seeing a growing movement among Floridians to finally recognize our dying environment needs major help. Florida's environment is what makes Florida unique.

Even the most selfish ahole with a multi million dollar estate on the water has to recognize the importance of cleaning up our waterways. You can't enjoy that river you live on if it's toxic from algae blooms. You can't swim or boat in it if it's bad for your health. And you can't sell your house if the waterway it sits on is destroyed."
2461,"Zebra Mussels are an invasive species brought to the great lakes from a freighter who dropped their ballast water in Lake st. Clair (between erie and huron). Once they had a foothold there was zero species here who ate / could eat them and they quickly flourished. They seemed like a great thing at the time, but quickly we started noticing them, a few at a time on decks of ships, or the wheels etc. Then very quickly they coated the shallow wrecks and made the into just lumps of mussels on the bottom with zero wood to be found.

At one point the Canadian Government paid to start having some of the wrecks surveyed and I was one of the lucky few that was able to be part of that group, few free dive weekends, lots of cool ships and lots of measurements. Those ships have since disappeared under many feet of zebra mussels. At one point I heard an estimate that the mussels in lake Erie were were over 10 feet deep in the deepest parts of that lake (shallowest of the great lakes, about 160 - 190' I think). They made their way north and east. The last time I dove at depth they had started to coat some of those wrecks as well.  We are talking fairly deep too.

So they introduced Gobbi fish (think that's the spelling) because the government thought, hey why not bring another foreign invasive species to the waters that have zero natural enemies and hope.. HOPE..they eat the zebra mussels, well they didn't turns out the zebra mussels weren't as tasty as our mussels or our bait fish, the gobbi's thrived along side of our zebra mussels and now the ecosystem of the great lakes is fairly well messed up.

if I sound angry, I am. It has been nothing short of a disaster, destroying the ecosystem was bad enough, as in, really bad. But it destroyed most water sports in the great lakes, you would never want to walk on the bottom freely anymore as your feet might get cut into a bloody mess.

Sorry for the rant."

To pay for a nice,.clean, monitored beach. I don't mind crowded, and I love the beach town shops that are nearby. 

I tried long beach after so many people recommended it, but was not impressed. Super rocky, the water wasn't nice or clean. People were loading their boats in right at the beach so that made it loud and not natural and overall it had a real trailer trash vibe. It wasn't a nice sandy spot, it was small and grassy and kind of gross. 

Nickel beach is also nice, you can drive your car right on and I dig that, very American northeast ocean beach vibes. Super clear water, and it's got lots of sand bars so you can venture out pretty far. You need day passes tho, and you pay en entry fee to park. 

Municipal beach used to be ok when it was a hidden gem, but now with an increase in popularity it has become really sketchy. Lake Ontario is also not as nice as Lake Erie in general. You mentioned Lakeside park was nasty, not sure what you mean. I was there this evening and it was absolutely lovely. Clear water, sandy, clean, nice sky. In August it can get smelly when the seaweed sort of stagnates, so I tend to go there in July. 

So what makes a good beach for you? Secluded or busy? Clear water? Deeper or shallower water? Do you like a beach town vibe or do you like something more natural?"
2481,"I'm not OP, but Lake Erie is dirtier and more polluted than Lake Ontario. It experiences more algal blooms (the seaweed you were referencing) and is probably not as safe to swim in."
2482,"The article:

With a vast portion of the United States coping with exceptional drought this summer, conditions are ripe in many places for harmful algal blooms, bringing additional threats to already-stressed water systems and increased health risks for communities.

The blooms are in large part fueled by phosphorus and nitrogen runoff from industrial agricultural operations, which provide a feast of nutrients for cyanobacteria ‚Äî a group of aquatic, photosynthetic bacteria that grow out of control and overwhelm their ecosystems in the presence of excess nutrients.

To protect humans and animals from potentially lethal effects of the blooms, officials have closed beaches in Wisconsin and temporarily shuttered shellfish harvesting in Florida. Annual blooms in Oregon have contributed to what has become a full-blown water war at the California border.

To the possible relief of residents living in parts of Ohio, Michigan and Ontario, many of whom have come to intimately know the telltale stench and economic impacts that wash up when a toxic soup of algae blankets the water, scientists with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) have predicted a lower-than-average algal bloom in Lake Erie this year.

But a growing body of environmental health research links harmful algal blooms across the world to chronic health conditions spurred by microcystin: a kind of cyanobacteria linked to liver failure and increasingly, cancer. Some residents in downstream communities who have lived through past algal bloom-spurred water crises are still bracing for the worst.

Alicia Smith is executive director of The Junction Coalition, a neighborhood organization focused on social, environmental, economic and peace education that formed in response to the Toledo, Ohio, water crisis in 2014, which left 500,000 people without drinking water. ‚ÄúSeven years later we still hold our breath wondering if in July, August and September we will get a notification that we can‚Äôt drink, touch or bathe in the water,‚Äù Smith told Truthout.

Smith estimates that a majority of community members in her area in Toledo, known as the Junction neighborhood, were not aware of dangerous levels of microcystin in the water at the time. ‚ÄúWe had to get football players and basketball players from our local schools to help canvas and drop off water,‚Äù she said.

Since then, in an attempt to avoid another algal bloom-fueled water crisis, a new regional commission has planned to invest in improvements to its water treatment facilities, including a $100 million new water intake system and $70 million water towers, as the Toledo Blade reported. But the cost is being passed off on city residents, whom the Blade estimated would pay double the cost of 2019 water prices by 2025.

For many Toledo residents, those prices are prompting an affordability crisis, Smith said, noting that residents still worry that water flowing through the tap may be making family members sick.

A Burst in Blooms?

Algal blooms are nothing new. According to a June article in Nature, Japanese explorers reported ‚Äúred waters,‚Äù known now as ‚Äúred tides,‚Äù as early as the year 731. But agricultural runoff from industrial farms and lawns and a lapse in limits and enforcement around nutrient runoff may be leading to bigger blooms. Research by the United Nations Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission has suggested that the harm caused by blooms strongly correlates with the growth of the aquaculture industry.

The tame 2021 NOAA prediction for Lake Erie is based in part on lower-than-average March and April rains this year, which brought minimal phosphorus discharge. Hans W. Paerl, a professor at the University of North Carolina Institute of Marine Sciences, told Truthout that, at the end of the day, the NOAA algal bloom forecast is only a prediction. After a dry early spring, May and June ended up bringing higher-than-average rainfall and with it, nutrients, such that if a significant drought were to set in, conditions could change ‚Äî though drought conditions in northwest Ohio remain more moderate than much of the rest of the U.S.

The kind of extremes that the climate crisis brings makes the NOAA‚Äôs job a tough one, Paerl said, and means the bloom prediction could swiftly go awry. ‚ÄúIf the water suddenly slows down, well then those nutrients are going to be sitting in the lake, you know, ready to support a bloom.‚Äù

Through Water, Through Air

‚ÄúOhio has a very chronic problem,‚Äù Jiyoung Lee, an environmental health sciences professor at Ohio State University, told Truthout, as does much of the rest of the world.

Lee has been studying cancer data in the U.S. and in South Korea for the past 10 years. Together with a wide-ranging team of collaborators, Lee has found that microcystin strongly correlates with increased rates of liver cancer. In a 2020 article, the team compared cancer data from Ohio residents diagnosed with a malignant tumor between 2000 and 2014. They linked those cases to respective census tracts, allowing the team to connect a given person to their drinking water source.

Using satellite sensing to generate a list of surface water sources with visible cyanobacteria blooms from 2002 to 2011, Lee‚Äôs research team found that people whose water came from lakes and rivers impacted by algal blooms had a 17 percent higher incidence of liver cancer in comparison with those estimated to receive groundwater ‚Äî a source coming from cooler and darker underground sources where algal blooms are not prevalent. Census tracts estimated to be served by bloom-impacted waters were also linked with higher levels of poverty and more likely to be coded as non-white.

Lee says exposure is commonly understood as occurring by sipping contaminated water, eating fish living in impacted ecosystems, or coming in physical contact through recreational activities like swimming or angling.

But exposure happens in more subtle ways too. Now, Lee is studying how the use of bloom-impacted water to irrigate crops like carrots and lettuce might also be contributing to the incidence of liver disease. The research is particularly pertinent given that 70 percent of freshwater withdrawals around the world go to irrigating agricultural fields, according to the United States Geological Survey. ‚ÄúWe need to look at [exposure] in a more holistic way,‚Äù Lee said, noting potential links between other cyanotoxins and neurological conditions like Parkinson‚Äôs and Alzheimer‚Äôs.

A 2020 review by Paerl found that people might face exposure to toxins in even more passive ways, by inhaling aerosol particles from bloom-impacted sources that drift off of water flowing through household faucets.

‚ÄúZero Maggots‚Äù

While there is no one-size-fits-all fix for harmful algal blooms, Paerl said; there are plenty of what he calls ‚Äúnon-rocket science solutions,‚Äù like leaving native vegetation to serve as a buffer between development and waterways rather than carpeting the ground with grass, and ensuring that that septic systems are not leaking into water systems.

Most essential, Paerl said, is reducing the inputs that lead to algal blooms. ‚ÄúThe knob we can tweak is the nutrient knob.‚Äù

Kristy Meyer is associate director of Freshwater Futures, a nonprofit focused on building political power to promote water democracy and empower residents to protect the Great Lakes. She says the Biden administration should expand which waters qualify as ‚ÄúWaters of the United States‚Äù ‚Äî those that are protected under the Clean Water Act. In 2020, the Trump administration stripped federal protections for wetlands and streams. ‚ÄúI think of Lake Erie like a heart,‚Äù Meyer said. ‚ÄúIf you cut off part of the capillaries, or the arteries, the heart starts to die. That‚Äôs basically what we‚Äôre doing when we roll back the Waters of the U.S.‚Äù

A new, more expansive rule, would allow regulators to set a daily limit on nutrients for smaller water bodies like wetlands and streams, requiring industrial-scale operations like factory or monocrop operations to figure out how to decrease what they‚Äôre releasing to a certain level or face consequences. Meyer also suggests that the next iteration of the farm bill, set to expire in 2023, should include provisions requiring agricultural operations receiving federal subsidies to be subject to a nutrient monitoring plan. Existing federal law sidesteps the nutrient runoff problem, as the Associated Press reported in 2017.

Increased protections are also needed from a public health standpoint, Toledo residents say. According to the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, drinking water is safe for adults so long as it contains less than 1.6 microgram per liter of microcystin. The World Health Organization‚Äôs limit is 1 microgram per liter. No health guidelines yet exist in the U.S. spelling out safe levels of microcystin in food, a guideline that researchers like Lee would like to see established.

Smith says health standards that allow for any level of a toxic substance to enter human bodies are not good enough from a justice point of view, given the legacy of health disparities that map onto race and class in the U.S.

‚ÄúWe always have these wonderful numbers: Five [micrograms per deciliter] of lead is allowed. That‚Äôs better than, you know, 15‚Ä¶. But zero is the amount of lead that is safe for consumption,‚Äù Smith says.

In the same sense, Smith contends that no level of microcystin is safe for consumption, and that local, state and federal governments should work toward fully eliminating it, and other toxins, from water and food systems.

‚ÄúZero maggots is what I want to eat,‚Äù Smith said."

2499,"Those of you who think the boomers wrecked the world, the generation before the boomers did this endlessly, and the boomers had to pay to clean it up. 

The greatest generation believed that the environment was so vast, that any amount of pollution would be a drop in the ocean, so to speak.  Living standards advanced rapidly so no one really cared.  It turns out things are really cheap if you can just exhaust your pollution to a limitless environment.

Boomers inherited superfund sites, a disappearing ozone layer, air pollution so bad you couldn't see the sun, ever, in Los Angeles, and rivers and lakes so polluted that the rivers into lake Erie routinely caught on fire.  Yes, the river.

In order to pay the immense costs of a cleanup, politicians turned to pensions.  The country deferred paying its civil servants so that boomers could receive the benefits the civil servants provided, while the generations after the boomers paid all of the costs for the benefits the boomers got.  To get the civil servants to agree to defer their income, we promised them guaranteed returns on the money they deferred that would be far in excess of anything they could ever earn themselves.  Then, instead of putting that money away year by year, we just ignored it, and left all those costs for the next generation.  

The insanity was not extended to the post office, once it became clear that the post office would be forever shrinking.  Unlike what the media tries to tell you, when someone is hired for the post office, no one puts away 70 years worth of pension payments, but they do put away one year, every year, so that when the post office is half its size, the pensions will be there.  So someone who earns $45,000 and  is expected to work for 50 years has 1/50th of their total estimated pension payout set aside each year by setting postal rates to the appropriate amount to cover it.  That means the people who mail letters today will pay for the pension of the letter carrier who carries that letter today. You won't be stuck with that cost.

The boomers will pay for those pensions.  All other pensions are unfunded, and generations after the boomers will pay for those pensions for services the boomers got, but you will now pay for.  Thats how all this mess was cleaned up without impacting current living standards.  It will of course impact your living standards.  Thanks boomers!"

2501,What have you done to my precious Lake Erie?
2502,"I live in Chatham-Kent, if you are looking for a few acres around 500,000 to 600,000 you can find something here. If the house is move in ready it will probably have a lot of offers. If you are willing to renovate you might have better luck. The area is very ag based and the land is extremely flat but is very heavy clay in most of the area. Which offers it‚Äôs own challenges. Within CK you are probably always within 10 minutes to any small town and within 30 mins of Chatham which has a lot of good restaurants, breweries etc. The Western part is also very close to Windsor about 30 mins and East is within about an hour from London. Downfalls: very little natural areas but there are some gems like Rondeau and many Conservation Areas. It‚Äôs a conservative community but most people are welcoming. I would NEVER buy a property along the bluff of Lake Erie however. You will find waterfront property with very nice houses for a very good price. That is because the erosion is AWFUL. Do not be fooled. A lot of people from Toronto have bought and I feel bad for them. Also stay away from Erie Shore Drive. The wind gets so strong it pushes waves against most of the houses. If you are interested in any of these house call the Conservation Authority before buying. They can tell you rate of erosion and restrictions. Anyways CK is a good place to live."
2503,"My biggest concern with CEag is downstream runoff pollution.  Leamington, Ontario is where much of our pot and tomates are grown. When the greenhouse nutrients are flushed they end up in Lake Erie.  This lake now suffers frequent bumper crops of algae, causing fish die-offs, and threatening one of the few commercial inland fisheries."
2504,"Lol as a Western New Yorker I have absolutely never heard that buffalo was a clean city.

I'm gonna guess you're not familiar with the industrial waste history around there. Lake Erie was a dead lake at one point. The invasive species zebra muscles helped massively in the cleanup. Everyone dumped all the chemicals in the water. Empty steel mills rusting away. Industrial waste still haunts the area.

There are very nice well kept areas, but no, Western NY is not a clean place. I had a literal toxic waste dump behind my school lmao. But you wouldn't know just looking at it, just looked like a nice line of trees. But behind the trees were some fucked up vats of horror.

Plus Love Canal. Which I mean technically isn't in Buffalo but came from the industry there."
2505,"Yes.  In honor of our Lake Erie bros, fuck Tom Brady.   As in so many of the recent Super Bowls, I‚Äôm hoping we can avoid having a winner and just watch the commercials and have some beer and then move on to next season."
2506,"Or they built a bottom dollar party house that will eventually be removed/placed after extensive flooding and water damage. If it‚Äôs anything like on lake Erie, that house will get destroyed by ice and storms. This looks bran new and temporary."
2507,"It depends which lake, I guess.  Lake Superior is clean enough to safely drink from at just ten feet from shore.  I think part of Lake Erie has caught fire a couple of times."
2508,"Ohio is a strange state. I have always enjoyed going there, but it is strange. Cincinnati is essentially a city in Kentucky. In fact if you go to Cincinnati and don't want to stay in Downtown Cincinnati, you can stay in a hotel in Kentucky on the Ohio river and are basically in the city. Also, Cincinnati is where they put Chili on Spaghetti and look at the rest of the country like they are weird. Cleveland is nice. It's very cold in the winter, and is stuck up against Lake Erie. The outer areas of Cleveland are weird because everyone is American, but they sound Canadian. Actually they sound like an odd mix of Canadian and the old SNL Super Fans characters. It seems like state that is stuck in the middle of nothing and has to create its identity for itself and this oddly super toxic mega patriotism is just such the wrong way to go."
2509,"Zebra mussels cleaned up Lake Erie. 

Without them the lake would still be a pond of heavy metals and chemical waste. We used to be told not to eat fish from the lake more than once a week or two. Swimming was a crapshoot and the whole thing stank and was just an ugly open sore. 

We'll solve the Zebra Mussel problem, or we wont. But at least the lake is clean now."
2510,"Yea, no one cares about migratory birds anyway! It's not like Lake Erie has millions of them passing through the area every year."
2511,"[An Offshore Wind Farm on Lake Erie Moves Closer to Reality, but Will It Ever Be Built?](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/26102020/icebreaker-project-lake-erie-cleveland-wind-energy/)

The proposed project is nearer to Cleveland than the city of Erie, but I imagine it's the same basic concept."
2512,"Use your own lake. Lake Erie isn‚Äôt big, it‚Äôs also a lot of Erie‚Äôs main recreational area. It‚Äôs a fragile recovering ecosystem after the heavy pollution decades ago that it‚Äôs still recovering from. and more importantly to you eco geniuses it is covered in icebergs all winter. Your wind towers will be pulverized by ice banging against it all winter."
2513,"I mean, if we're talking artificial power islands, [this is a good option, too](https://thorconpower.com/design/#fission-island).  Use it to help clean the pollution out of Lake Erie's water for an small subsidy.  It'll already have a coolant intake; just overbuild the coolant system and return higher water volumes closer to the input temperature."
2514,"Well, what else is there to do aside from Cedar Point and the garbage in Lake Erie?"
2515,Yeah they‚Äôre pretty bad but they actually have their own fatal flaw. They reproduce so much in one area they use up all the oxygen and create a dead zone and wind up killing themselves off.  We don‚Äôt have them in Lake Erie anymore because of this. That‚Äôs why a lot of Lake Erie beaches are literally made of zebra muscle shells instead of sand.
2516,Zebra mussel problem in Lake Erie solve itself. They reproduced so much they created dead oxygen zones and killed them selves off.  I haven‚Äôt seen them in the lake in a long time and that‚Äôs part of the reason why most of our beaches are covered in disintegrating muscle shells. They were a blessing and a curse.
2517,Access to Lake Erie will be crucial in the impending global water crisis. We have the largest freshwater source in the world in the Great Lakes.
2518,Do they still stink like fish? I could never get past the smell.  It reminded me WAY too much of the fish die offs in the summer when I lived near Lake Erie.  Was half the damn summer getting rid of the stench of decaying fish.
2519,"There was a recent article about the Lake Erie being poisoned / polluted again. By the time we need the lake, it'll be totally effed because of Republican corruption. Cheers!"
2520,I live in a not remote place and my well water is good for nothing but watering plants. My parents were forced to get a hookup to the city water because the well stuff made me sick as a kid. Yummy lake erie water!!
2521,"That's a fair point. I don't know much about wind farm siting. But I do know that wind energy in Lake Erie [is being considered](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/26102020/icebreaker-project-lake-erie-cleveland-wind-energy/). And I think there are reasons that wind energy in the Great Lakes could be a good idea, including proximity to population centers and the fact that there's already a substantial transmission grid linked to the Niagara Falls area, where there's a lot of old hydropower."
2522,Imo it don‚Äôt snow like it used to 15-20 years ago. I remember as a kid snow always being deep and it lasting for months before melting. I live right on Lake Erie so we basically got dumped on with snow till the lake froze and then it‚Äôs just cold af. Now not so much
2523,"I thrift a lot (already worn in, just have to ignore how they got that way until I‚Äôve washed a couple times) and wear leggings under the few pairs of jeans I own. But I live right off Lake Erie and it‚Äôs always cold here. My American Eagle jeans I‚Äôve painstakingly taken care of for 8 years are finally wearing out so I‚Äôm checking out some of these suggestions too :)"
2524,"WARNING: This plan may cuymean reversing the flow of the Cuyahoga River, creating a potential fire hazard for everyone south of Lake Erie."
2525,"If you google ""80's big hair"" you will see exactly what they are talking about.  I was a teen during the end of the 80's and I had a huge lion's mane.  My hair added 3-4 inches to my height and was down to my lower back.  All spiral curls poofed out.  It was an amazing feat of teasing, curling iron and lots of hairspray.  I am personally responsible for part of the hole in the ozone layer over lake Erie."
2526,"Along Lake Erie there is a lot of ""black"" - really purple - glass nodules.  They are discarded slag from a nearby General Electric plant where they made lightbulbs and the purple glass pieces come from the manufacturing process."
2527,"If it's any consolation, the permafrost has begun to accelerate melting. Soon Lake Erie won't freeze at all and the shoreline will show it. On the upside, Ohio won't be covered under several thousand feet of ice any time soon again."
2528,"Looks like your STASH is almost as big as mine!  I actually cleared out my SABLE and donated 2200 skeins (yes!) to a local organization (that is close to my heart) in honor of my amazing Mother who taught me to crochet.  I still have over 3,000 skeins ‚Äî I stopped counting!  Yes, I am definitely have a SABLE and I don‚Äôt mind if others think I am crazy!  I make blankets and scarves for the homeless ‚Äî including Veterans ‚Äî living in a three county area of COLD Northwestern PA, near Lake Erie, as well as baby blankets for new little ones of our deployed military.  My obsession helps others so I think God will forgive my yarn greediness! 

May I use your acronym SABLE?  It is the perfect description for me and my yarn habit!"
2529,Won't be long before we all have to live on houseboats in Lake Erie.
2530,"What in the actual...why is RH mispronouncing Lake Erie considered content? Four of the five Great Lakes are named after native Indian tribes, including Lake Erie. I guess alienating the Black audience wasn‚Äôt enough for her, moving on to making fun of Native American heritage too? Maybe a little college would‚Äôve helped her be more informed and cultured. Just not funny on several levels..."
2531,"I'm not a sand expert, but I think for your turtle's sake it would be better to get some processed sand. 

Who knows how many tiny, evil organisms and pollutants are lurking in that sand, waiting to mess your turtle up. Especially sand from Lake Erie, since we all know there's lots of toxic stuff in the water."
2532,"It really is a shame. As someone relatively new to the state, I love Ohio but it‚Äôs outdoor activities fall under the cons list for me. Lake Erie *could* be such a huge draw if it weren‚Äôt so polluted. Reading the recommendations for safe fish eating out of Lake Erie makes me feel so sad."
2533,"Yes. And if you took high school ecology you should probably understand why.

A quote from Scientific American explains it concisely with an example:

&gt;...Warmer temperatures in the winter of 2006 caused Lake Erie to not freeze for the first time in its history. This actually led to increased snowfalls because more evaporating water from the lake was available for precipitation. 

[https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/earthtalks-global-warming-harsher-winter/](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/earthtalks-global-warming-harsher-winter/)

In other words, warmer weather means more evaporation, more evaporation means harsher spikes of cold weather.

If you don't want to trust Scientific American, of course as a scientifically researched topic, there's plenty of other independently conducted experiments and analysis' that have come to the same conclusion that are just a search away."
2534,"As someone who lives by lake Erie, yes we do. At the same time, each area has their own problems. I would be scared shitless if I had to live through hurricane season in Texas."
2535,"Hire someone or find someone who is experienced to show you the ropes. It‚Äôs not safe to just walk on to the ice without the proper knowledge and safety gear. Additionally it‚Äôs not safe to just walk on to the ice because other people already have. If you are determined to try ice fishing yourself, go buy safety picks, an auger, ice fishing rods, ice jigs, a 50 foot rope and a spud bar. Check the ice every couple steps with the spud bar. I‚Äôd recommend a smaller body of water than Lake Erie to learn on. No fish is worth dying over."
2536,"Here are some actual real ways that the meat industry is damaging people.

Methane release: methane is 30 times more effective at heat capture vs C02; agribusiness, in particular livestock and feed production, is one of the largest global contributors of methane on the earth's atmosphere. Reducing meat consumption would be a major step in reducing the very real impact of global warming.

Algae blooms: Livestock waste run off (along with other agribusiness run off) is a direct contributor to the formation of algae blooms in fresh water systems. The lake Erie blooms are the cause of major fish and ecological die offs and makes it unsafe to swim or boat in.

Health impacts: Meat and dairy should be eaten in moderation assuming average amounts of physical activity; their caloric values are very dense. Along with this, processed meats are major sources of carcinogens. Thanks to regulatory capture, meat prices are subsidized to drive consumption. This, along with food pyramids that over promote meat consumption (again, regulatory capture, the development of the new food pyramid in Canada was highly politicized), is a contributing factor to obesity in the west."
2537,"I actually watched something like this form once in Western New York on Lake Erie. The mouth of an outlet creek happened to be the ‚Äúweak point‚Äù one spring while all of the 10-12‚Äô thick ice started melting and breaking up on the lake. There must have been some pretty crazy winds in Canada that day (it was perfectly calm where I was) but it pushed all the ice towards the shore very hard, and it smashed its way up the creek outlet. All the way up to under a relatively low bridge that crossed the creek. It widened what was a 30‚Äô wide creek to about 120‚Äô and had pieces of ice over 80‚Äô wide and probably stacked up about 20-30‚Äô and it even wedged itself under the bridge and slightly lifted it off the ground. 

And by widening the creek... I mean absolutely leveling all trees (regardless of size) and ripping out all grass and everything without any effort. 

I‚Äôll never forget the shaking earth and the noise it made. Just absolutely terrifying power - and for Mother Nature it was completely effortless."
2538,"The black swamp and the rest of the Maumee valley was once entirely Lake Maumee. The swamp exists because of all the clay left by the lake. If it wasn't constantly artificially drained it would naturally revert to being a shallow extension of lake erie. Fort wayne basically sits on the edge of the lake, which is why it is so much higher."
2539,"Yeah, I use our winters an example that climate change is real. When I was a kid we'd get feet of snow all winter, Lake Erie would reliably freeze, and there'd be pond hockey tournaments on the Erie Basin Marina harbor. The last few winters we rarely see snow over a foot, Lake Erie doesn't freeze above 30%, they've had to move the hockey tournaments off the harbor to a normal rink. We didn't play any true pond hockey last year, only twice the year before. This February has been the only time our ponds froze, we've played twice so far, and in March it'll likely be too warm for the ponds to freeze thick enough to play anymore. ODR's might still work, briefly, built on solid ground with enough insulation or elevation to protect the ODR from the geothermal heat from the ground. 

Twenty years ago I never thought I'd say ""our winters are too mild"". But here we are, squeezing all our pond hockey into one month's worth of polar cold blast from Canada."
2540,"I just call Lake Erie the dead lake. On account of every time I visit all I see is dead things floating to the top and coming to shore.

Let's just say it's called Erie for a reason."
2541,Yea I'm stoked to try when lake erie unfreezes! I kitefoil but I'm hoping winging should open up spots where I can't launch a kite! Plus this board should be a good intro to pronefoiling (the lake has lots of shit waves that would be great for the foil)
2542,"I live a few blocks away from Lake Erie in the suburbs outside of Cleveland and I love that we live near a lake. It‚Äôs so pretty- till it‚Äôs warm enough to want to go into, and then it‚Äôs basically a very full swamp. Depends on the day and the algae, because it‚Äôs not always awful- but definitely not as pretty or as clean as you‚Äôd hope for."
2543,"&gt; While the plant only discharges treated water

That's the plan, but what about overflow?  The city has combined storm/sanitary sewers, which means most of the rainwater in that sewer district heads to the treatment plant, too.  Dunno about Buffalo, but I know when it rains too hard in Hamburg, raw sewage flows into Lake Erie at Woodlawn Beach."
2544,"Speaking of glaciers, it's really cool to see the elevation just SW of Lake Erie, starting in NW Ohio, going down into Indiana. You can see very well defined ridges where rhe glaciers would pause for a while as they were melting"
2545,"Buffalo, like a lot of cities it's age, does have CSOs/combined sewer overflows. They are far from ideal and bad for the environment, but it was lake erie or everyones basements. The BSA is under a lot of pressure to move away from this system and they are slowly getting there. The costs of doing so are tremendous so it's slow going."
2546,"I will recommend Cincy or CLE over Columbus any day if someone has to make a choice. Lots more history, architecture, and culture in both. Nothing wrong with Columbus...but I don‚Äôt see what the big things to do are outside of the zoo, which isn‚Äôt even in the city. Cleveland has James Beard chefs, University Circle, the Rock Hall, Cuyahoga Valley Natl Park, Lake Erie, and great architecture. Cincy has great architecture, the coolest bridges, a really historic and scenic waterfront, nice museums, nice neighborhoods &amp; suburbs, and also an internationally recognized zoo.

I will recommend Hocking Hills over everything though. I‚Äôve been to over 30 national parks, mostly out West, and still Hocking Hills State Park is special! It‚Äôs nothing close to Yosemite or Zion in grandeur, but it such an gem to have here in the Buckeye State."
2547,"Yes, your edit is correct. During the day it‚Äôs much warmer than freezing in Kentucky so everything is melting to the point they can remove ice off the roads this way. 

Night time is a completely different fucking story especially over here in Louisville with the river. 

Because of the extreme differences in night and day here, the situation is always evolving. It‚Äôs very different from where I grew up near Lake Erie and being used to lake effect."
2548,"Well in Fernan there are a few things that may play a role in the nutrient loads. Untreated stormwater is a big player. Septic runoff, construction of the new road within the riparian area (thus less attenuation of sediment,) a farm within in the watershed (haven't done much in the watershed since 2016 but last I knew, the farmer was resistant to changing and practices,) manure from horses/goats, dispersed campsites without toilets, and possibly a newly established population of waterfowl frequenting the lake. Plus longer and warmer summers, and droughts can increase frequency and duration of algal blooms.  

https://www.iwac.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Fernan-Lake-TMDL-Final-2013.pdf#page47

I wish it were that easy to solve the problem, but unfortunately it seems to be a culmination of a lot of things that need to be addressed. Getting rid of big lawns certainly would help but may or may not put the lake below the threshold to stop the blooms.

Edit: sentences"
2549,"I think you're right that it could have been different if this were in WA, but not in a legal sense.... As far as I'm aware, other than the TMDL portion of the clean water act (federal law) there aren't any laws that regulate or require remediation or clean up of pollutants unless it's a drinking water source. Even if there's ESA listed species! Clean up is mostly voluntary regardless of where you are. So it sounds like in this case it kinda comes down to certain people in Idaho caring more about tourism dollars above all else (no surprise there.) And also WA also tends to have a lot more grant dollars and support available for watershed restoration, so a lake in WA potentially could have fared better just because it's easier to get money to fix stuff and our government and people are generally in support of it."
2550,"There was a video someone tweeted of some guy skating down the Cuyahoga (Yes, the river that caught on fire) a few days ago and that dumps into Lake Erie. But, I'll be honest, that is the first time I've ever seen someone skate on that or anything close to the lake. We haven't gotten cold enough to have safe skating ice."
2551,C'mon man don't do our lake erie bros like that
2552,Kind of interesting for me. I can sometimes see light pollution from the United States from the north side of Lake Erie.
2553,"Yes.  And Buffalo happens to be on Lake Erie and not Lake Ontario, so you‚Äôd never see it off in the horizon.   Rochester is simply too far off to see."
2554,"I swear, pizza workers are the true heroes in this world. I‚Äôve been with a company for 10 years now and very often during severe weather we were the only ones open. Even during the Lake Erie water crisis that hit my town, we shipped in fresh water so we could still make food for people. I drove in blizzard conditions to get food to people. 

Please always tip your delivery drivers."
2555,"Also have to be careful of the sea wall. On Lake Erie, if the lake doesn‚Äôt fully freeze during winter, lakeside houses tend to lose much more land from storms. Sometimes a few feet a year. It‚Äôs getting worse each year due to climate change."
2556,We need to support nuclear power and have much more wind generation. Lake Erie is the perfect place for this and we should be leading the country in clean/renewable energy production.
2557,I like how Lake Erie and Lake Ontario are just completely gone.
2558,"[Your car, too, can look like you parked it near Lake Erie before a winter storm!](https://ktla.com/2016/01/12/frigid-storm-transforms-car-parked-along-lake-erie-into-ice-sculpture/)"
2559,I guess that explains why they only show up in massive black clouds that you can hear from miles away every couple years by Lake Erie.
2560,Bald Eagles are native across the continental United States.  They got wiped out on the East Coast by poachers (until they got federal protection).  But what really did them in was the use of DDT during the 1940s through 1960s.   Their eggs were too thin-walled to survive.  Bald Eagles have been making a huge comeback since the 1980s.   It wasn't that long ago that birders were excited that there were four nests in the entire state (all on Lake Erie).   Now there are hundreds of nests.
2561,"I can‚Äôt speak for Lake Michigan, but we‚Äôve been warned not to get on the Ice covering Lake Erie right now because of this exact thing. As a matter of fact, several people in Cleveland had to be rescued yesterday or the day before because the ice broke from the mainland and started to drift."
2562,This happened over the weekend on Lake Erie in Cleveland.  10 people had to be rescued by the Coast Guard.
2563,"The wind forecast is the thing to watch. I ice fish the north shore of Lake Erie. Gentle winds from the south or west? Good to go. Anything over 15 mph winds from the north, stay the fuck off the ice."
2564,I'm from Buffalo the shithole of NY and I'm right with you brother! I've heard that because we are so close to Lake Erie that when global warming actually makes large changes to our environment it might become a resort town.
2565,"So, like the chalks of England I can say that the Lake Erie area of the upper midwest is underlaid by very thick salt deposits. Probably laid down during the high water mark of the polar ice caps melting that laid down your chalk. Totally my guess as to the timing. About 1800 feet below the city of Detroit are the salt beds. I toured the mine back in the 90's. The seam that I stood in was at least 40 feet thick. We were told by the tour guide that it took 10,000 years to precipitate a one inch of thickness. Geologic time is amazing. The salt beds extend east to New York state and are mined throughout the region. Salt mining is also happening  in SE Ontario as well. The salt is turned into table salt used for human consumption but I think most of it is spread out over our roads in the winter to melt all the snow we get. Humans are genius at polluting the surface of the earth."
2566,And the Cuyahoga River caught on fire - and Lake Erie was dead.
2567,"Lake Erie was so polluted at one point that yes, it literally caught on fire so maybe they made that a game mechanic üòÇ"
2568,"I definitely feel that. All of it. I'm here in Ohio, and the grind is soul crushing. Lake Erie is pretty fun, but everyone tries to make it expensive to enjoy. I used to be ok with heavy labor, but I'm old enough to know it's unsustainable now. Getting paid to be on the water sounds great. I'm headed to San Diego so I can have year round nice weather. Ohio weather has not been too kind to me. So hard to get some sunlight and outdoors time in."
2569,Do they? I live on Lake Erie and see thousands of dead fish every spring thaw.
2570,"Just posted on r/charity, though I can't donate myself atm. I hope we can save her from the depths of Lake Erie!"
2571,"Do you realize how massive the planet is? All humans poop about 800,000,000 liters of poo a day on average, thats about 3 trillion a year. The smallest of the Great Lakes, Lake Erie has a volume close to 500 trillion liters."
2572,Where are you From? We also get them pretty bad in northern Ohio close to Lake Erie.
2573,That doesn't make sense.  Lake erie is higher than lake ontario.  I'll probably be more crystal beach way anyway.   Everywhere south of muskoka is heavily polluted
2574,"yeah, of course it's going to be filthy.  dude, we live in a city where the ""water"" is raw sewage haha.  hell, the grand is fucking disgusting, but people swim in that.  probably safer to swim in lake erie than eat the fish.  how about not being a douche and shitting on the fact that i finally found a house i can afford in a decent town?  you want water that's not as polluted?  head north about 500kms."
2575,"Lol, thank you for proving me right. And Lamar is an incredible player and he proves it all the time. Baker is a stud and there is a lot of football to be played, I'm looking forward to watching all of it. In regard to your sophomoric mirror comment and popping off shots about post-industrial communities and there aesthetic qualities, I feel sorry for you because there is significant overlap between both of our cities. Both cities helped build America through their ports, industry, and diversity of people, religions, and cultures. I think both cities are beautiful with beautiful people. We don't spend time looking in mirrors because we spend it looking at breathtaking sunsets over our Great Lake Erie. Again, grace and humility will take you farther than what you current disposition is. I aint mad at ya, I got nothing but love for ya."
2576,I went to lake Erie once and the shore was filled with nothing but dead fish.
2577,I'd rather go fishing on that lake erie than mine...
2578,"With Lake Erie, on the US side you have to watch for that toxic algae. They are excellent at testing the water and notifying propel if it is present. On the Canadian side, any of the Ports are great (Port Stanley, Port Burwell, long Point) 

For Lake Ontario, I have heard Cobourg is nice but I would advise checking the lake warnings before you pick any spot. There are often pollution issues with Lake Ontario. 

Lake Huron is by far my fave."
2579,"Overfishing and pollution in Lake Erie; I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs the same in the other Great Lakes. 


There Used to be a lot of steel plants and industry along the lakes. 

The zebra mussels cleaned up much of the contamination BUT they clog intake of the pipes! So always something..."
2580,"Much love to you, rust-belt, lake erie, 0-16 brother"
2581,"That wasn't Lake Erie, that was the Cuyahoga River. And because of the river fires, the US EPA was established. Now, the river is much cleaner and healthy today."
2582,"Phosphate runoff from synthetic fertilizers are known to cause algal blooms that are terrible for our water systems. It‚Äôs a big reason communities around Lake Erie and the Gulf of Mexico have issues with water quality and wildlife. Manure as a fertilizer helps the soil retain water, helping it also retain phosphorus."
2583,"That sounds so fun!! I love Lake Erie!! Have a wonderful time!

I‚Äôve never rented through Airbnb but have always wanted to! Was the process easy?"
2584,As tainted as Lake Erie in 1978.
2585,"Glyphosate-based herbicides are hell on the environment. Farmers may have a right to do business, but they shouldn't have a right to poison ecosystems. Runoff from farms can wreak havoc kilometres away from where it originates. We need to protect basins that collect water from large farm-covered watersheds. Just look at the algae blooms in Lake Erie. Banning glyphosate-based herbicides shouldn't be a controversial idea‚Äì we know how bad they are."
2586,The fertilizer runoff is killing Lake Erie! But big ag calls the tune and the politicians dance!
2587,"Yes, Minnesota is the land of 10,000 lakes and has more surface freshwater than any other state other than Alaska. And we tap into large aquifers. But ag runoff and other pollution going on is a very valid concern. Need I remind how close Detroit is to Lake Erie and Lake Huron?"
2588,"Gonna go with...Walked on Lake Erie when it was frozen. This is not a good idea. I walked out almost to where the ice stopped. A wave crashed over the ice and got my feet wet and I had a moment of ‚Äúoh shit, that‚Äôs freezing.‚Äù And ran back to shore. I was out to about the end of the stone pier. I know of at least 6 people that have died this year from doing this though I guess it doesn‚Äôt sound dangerous writing it out."
2589,"Ohioan here. 
Cleveland could have been Anarch since the 90s but since the Financial Collapse in '08, automotive industry is gone yet replaced by Hospitals. Cleveland Clinic VA University Hospitals. Small tech start ups are also a thing. So maybe the Cam retook control? Violent crime has subsided a bit.
People are bonkers over Cleveland sports so maybe that supports a Malkavian Prince? Brujah?
But, Cargill Salt Mines under Lake Erie would be prime for Nosferatu.

Universities are(were?) huge in Ohio. 

Akron is similar, Hospitals and Akron University(huge in Law and Polymers) have taken over and cleaned up Akron.

Columbus I would say Cammy due to Football being such a big business. Possibly Anarch but Cammy seems to fit more, imo.  Essentially a big university town. Not sure the business interests there or if OSU's attendance has been effected. Pretty big suburban area as well. Rail shipping may still be a thing. Amazon is taking root in Ohio as well. 

Youngstown is your sabbat shithole. Depressed. Kenmore outside of Akron is also pretty grubby still.

Toledo is decent, either high class Sabbat or Anarch, or Cammy is a bulwark there.

There is a pretty big exodus out of the cities as new families age and people fear civil unrest, which we haven't seen a lot of.

LOTS of farmland outside the cities so Lupines, Gangrel, Nosferatu, and other outsiders can roam if they keep their head down.

Ohio is a pretty 'Purple' state, equal Trump/Non-Trump support even still. You could play up that tension, or, play up the peace between them. Perhaps the Sects in Ohio are at a stalemate or truce? Perhaps each is depleted and on the rebound unwilling to take the next move? Maybe they will proxy war more though the youngsters and the thinbloods? Maybe they are all hurting from internal strife to care?"
2590,"Cleveland to Buffalo along Lake Erie would be another nice line. 

Maybe one from NYC to Buffalo? Touching maybe Ithaca and Syracuse for Cornell and Syracuse and of course Albany some where."
2591,"Yes, and with the melting off of the glaciers, Lake Erie is rising on the north, and dumping water on Cleveland's shores, too. yet another reason why sea and coastal and shore levels cannot be computed easily nor compared. Complex systems are that way."
2592,"I know that water isn‚Äôt scarce everywhere, I live right on Lake Erie, one of the largest lakes in the world, but it still wastes the time of the people who make it safe to drink, the money in the water bills, and they could live in an area where it is scarce"
2593,The issue is only in the loud installation. In Lake Erie there‚Äôs a lot of research being done on how to install wind turbines that won‚Äôt be destroyed by ice. One of the big scientific innovations is the quieter installation they‚Äôve invented. In the ocean the ice isn‚Äôt the same sort of a problem. I hope they can take a page from the research done for Lake Erie to install these quietly.
2594,"That is idealistic, people don‚Äôt test ph levels of their local lake everyday and there is no guarantee the media will publish a story about lake pollution until it is way too late. Think Lake Erie"
2595,"Oh definitely, I agree. The Columbus metro area isn't limited by the Ohio River, Indiana border, Kentucky border, or Lake Erie so the sprawl is always eating away at the flat farmland. Just look at how fast Delaware County is growing."
2596,"Lake Erie literally started on fire in 1969 because a spark from a train track ignited waste and sewage that was being dumped. 

I'll repeat that: a fucking lake started on fire. You can argue that consumerism is worse but to act like previous generations weren't doing any polluting is asinine."

I‚Äôm in NE Ohio and compared to a lot of other states I‚Äôve been to Ohio is DENSELY populated (in the suburbs and semi rural areas). It‚Äôs hard to find anywhere in nature to be alone. It‚Äôs also pretty boring to hike in, but the plants are nice so I‚Äôll give it that. Lake Erie is also extremely stinky compared to other lakes. The cities are depressing af, and public transit is lacking despite the population."

2601,"Digging into it a little bit more, the Engineering report has three main stated benefits:

i) Eliminate potential sewage overflows to Lake Erie at Seacliff Beach.

ii) Eliminate unnecessary treatment of storm water at the pollution control centre.

iii) Make available the Seacliff trunk to operate as a separated sanitary sewer.

So my question to the City would be why is this group of homeowners being charged for benefits that may benefit the entire system of WWW users?

For i), by this I presume they are implying it is the sanitary sewer (not storm)? If so, why are you (and your neighbours) paying the cost that will benefit all residents that use that beach and value clean water? Is there a capacity study or something that shows explicit benefit to your neighbourhood?

For ii), not relevant to your bill as that is storm sewers (you are only paying for sanitary sewer). Unless they are talking about sanitary sewer inflow and infiltration (I&amp;I) problems here which is an entirely different can of worms! In that case, this is also a benefit to you.

For iii), what benefit does this provide to you as homeowners?

It's a done deal at this point frankly, but I would want to know how Exactly my property has been improved in writing. Substantially less probability of a sewer backup perhaps (which is well worth $6000 if that was an existing issue)?

This information likely was already explained in the 2017 Public Information Centre and/or report ENG-04-20 so finding and reading those would be a good start. I would do some more digging before calling the City and asking further questions."
2602,"The City is also working on [stream restoration along Tenmile Creek in Harroun Park in that area to stabilize the currently eroding stream](https://www.toledoblade.com/local/suburbs/2020/11/03/sylvania-gets-206-280-creek-restoration-grant/stories/20201103121). The development of these apartments will also increase the intensity of runoff directly into the water there which could negatively impact bank stability and so the reinforcement of the banks and removal of trees may be part of an effort to mitigate future bank erosion.

[From the concept plans for the apartment development](https://www.cityofsylvania.com/businesses/economic-development/current-development-projects/the-somo-project/) there is proposed work shown directly along the north bank of Tenmile Creek and the West Bank of North Tenmile Creek. There seems to be an emphasis in this development of creating spaces with views of the water (whether from apartments or the open spaces), and while that sounds nice, it may be unfortunate as the trees and vegetation that line streams (also called riparian vegetation) are very important for the health and quality of the streams and the waters downstream (e.g. Lake Erie). Clear cutting trees along the banks and replacing them with an occasional tree and the rest as turf grass (which will possibly be fertilized by a landscaper and result in additional nutrient pollution) is a step down for water quality, and as OP mentioned definitely a step down from the original forested feel of the area felt under the existing tree canopy. That being said if we are talking about trees being removed on the south bank of Tenmile Creek, even if that were done in support of bank stabilization for this development, there would be no reason not to replant [native] vegetation in that park area (though obviously it takes a while for plants to grow and the canopy to recover).

I‚Äôm making these comments from a distance right now so I haven‚Äôt seen any of this recent development in person and I may be off on how some of this is actually shaping up in reality."

2608,"[**Hazards on the Lake - Flag of Lake Erie**](https://i.imgur.com/D7MuMTm.png)

[Lake Erie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Erie) is one of the Great Lakes that is shared between Canada and the United States of America. As such, there is a storied [history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixty_Years%27_War) of fighting over the body of water. Most famous is the victory of [Oliver Hazard Perry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Hazard_Perry) during the war of 1812. In recent years the lake, once known for abundant fishing and recreational activities, has been in recovery from excessive pollution and invasive species.

Or even killarney has some super cool mini mountains of pure white quartz. Or go check out rondeau prov park with some oak savannah ecosystems with oak and sycamore trees that could almost rival the cedars and firs out here.


The big thing is view density. Ontario is so spread out you gotta drive to see some stuff but here in bc theres literally an amazing view around every bend"

2. No dumping raw toxic waste, sewage, and radioactive pollutants into drinking sources. Shit is ridiculous, the entire point of lake erie is so that we can dump toxic, deadly on contact, chemical waste into it

It's disgusting and it's wrong that you control your companies in this way."
2619,"Hey, I didn't say anything about kudzu. It wound up on the south shore of Lake Erie a few years ago and they've managed to hold it in the one spot for now. That stuff is an extreme threat to anything it gets near."
2620,"Continued relaxation of regulation in agriculture. Pesticides that were once banned, are being allowed again. Follow up studies found that farmworkers who were continuously exposed to low doses of pesticides over only a few years had increased risks of brain and reproductive health problems and cancer. This almost exclusively effects Latino workers, and my mother has suffered this effects from spending her teen years picking fruit.

There's also the basically unregulated use of dumping of chemicals and fertilizers into watersheds that threaten the safety of drinking water in the Great Lakes - which provides most of the world's supply of fresh water. Several years ago, there was a water crisis involving Lake Erie where the water was unsafe to drink due to unfilterable toxins released by algal blooms. The longer, warmer summers plus fertilizer run off creates the perfect environment for poisionous algae.

So yeah, agriculture has carte blanche to do whatever they want to the environment and their exploited workforce."
2621,"I first went to Waldameer the year RF2 opened, on a tour with a group that shall not be named. During our ERT, a huge thunderstorm blew up that we thought might shut us down, but the crew let us keep going. It was terrifying and exhilirating, watching lightning strike lake Erie as we plunged down the first drop, pelted by bullet rain, hoping we don't all die before the thing screeched to a halt.

Every time I'd get off, I'd think, ""Ok, that's it. I'll just go chill under the picnic pavillion until they take us to the next hotel."" But then I'd find myself trudging back up the ramp to the station, rolling the dice for another ride.

By 10:30, I was sat on the bus, drenched to the bone, freezing in the AC heading to wherever the hell we went next. This was one of the most ""worth it"" moments of the trip."

They have alot of old rundown factories along the water and whenever they were using them alot of stuff would fall or be thrown into the lake so now it's super dangerous. And even besides that we have an algae overgrowth problem. 

They have signs up saying you're not allowed to play in the water or you'll get fined."
2629,"That was such an obvious fake marketing-controversy too, like a book wasn't selling and they weren't going to reprint it, also had some illustrations that wouldn't be worth revising for how much money it would make.

And yeah there are already abridged Seuss books, The Lorax used to reference Lake Erie but they changed it after the pollution was addressed, and it was even used the rhyme at the end of that page."

2633,"You can remediate anything. Put drain tiles at the ends of farm fields to capture all the leftover phosphorus and nitrogen fertilizer, there you go, no more algea blooms in lake Erie. 

Anything is possible with technology and the will to do it.

Garbage cans are captured by a company that disposes of trash, instead of landfills, burn the trash, capture and scrub the air and reuse the materials and chemicals produced. Again, anything possible with technology and willpower.

Sewers, again the same concept, filter and remediate the water before release back to the rivers. Reuse the nitrogen and phosphorus waste as fertilizer, capture the chemicals and reuse them for other purposes. Again anything accomplished with technology and willpower."

A post apocalyptic Cleveland would be only slightly worse off than right now, so you could take some major inspiration from the modern day. And of course, we're known for our drug problem so really play into that and make fallout ohio a drug capitol for the region."
2636,"From what I remember, water quality gets worse as the weather gets warmer and after a lot of rain. Any of the Lake Ontario beaches should be fairly safe water quality wise right now. As a kid we used to still go in the unsafe water and just avoid getting any in our mouth nose eyes and ears. Not sure I‚Äôd recommend that though. Lake Erie is generally more dangerous to swim in as the undertow is stronger and can pull you out and under the water."

2653,"I spent most of my elementary years in North Carolina, going to the beach, shark tooth hunting, watching dolphins play in the water. By 5th grade we had moved to Michigan. The sand dunes, the lakes, the holiday's at a family's cabin were all things I loved. I hate being so far away from clean water. The water here is so bad. If I can put my hand under the water and it vanishes its a no go and sadly most of the water is like that. I miss seeing little fish swim and nibble on my toes, I miss the clear water of Lake Michigan (lake Erie was pretty dirty where I lived so we didnt swim in that lake). 

I also suffer from barometric weather changes pretty bad. Sometimes 3 days before it rains or snows i'll be laid up in bed because I get to dizzy I often hurt myself by just walking, I've passed out and fallen off the stairs (my bottom 4 are open), I've fallen off the sidewalk and twisted my foot, didnt pick my foot up high enough and tripped and fell into a wood beam outside my bathroom. And the weather changes constantly here, im just always in a state of depression and anxiety because of it, im not living life, im just living. 

I went to my cousins in Arkansas and it was beautiful, I went to a waterfall, went and collected crystals, floated in a lake with a mountain in the background, went and sat in a hot spring. I was just so at peace there, but I wouldn't want to live there. But I want to go to Maine, its been on my list for years and my friends and I all had plans to go in July but with covid no one had extra money cause they were all put on part time hours on rotations and some picked up extra jobs. We looked at moving there back in 2011 and my friends who live in that area love it. 

It sucks cause I feel trapped here. Im in a house I hate and have always hated. My parents when we tried to sell hounded me with texts daily about moving and we were only planning on moving 30 minutes away to be closer to work and when we couldn't sell told me how happy they were no one wanted my house. My husbands family is here all of them, so he wont leave. He just started up a new business venture, which I did approve but now kinda wish I hadn't cause at some point im gonna have to pull the plug and demand we move to the coast with more steady weather.

My wife is a Biologist and feeds me information as much as she can. I retain the general stuff, and sadly my general knowledge is still way beyond what most people know.

Back to the agricultural industry and pesticides. I do hope that they get banned or maybe regulate a FAR better alternative. Another huge thing is the agricultural industry needs to be regulated or incentivized to contain their own run-off on site. Maybe creating their own wetlands that farm tile drains to would be ideal. Literally every other industry either connects to a sanitary sewer or septic tank.

This is why SW Ontario and its great lakes are such shit-holes now. Especially Lake Erie. Every time there's a beach ban due to e-coli warnings, it's due to Agriculture.

It still baffles me how they are still allowed to run-off manure into local ditches, and ultimately into our great lakes."

Like a good Canadian, I always placed the blame on the US for our great lake problems. That's for sure blinded me to issues originating from Canadian industry.

I just learned of this and I'm flabbergasted. How are we not protecting the largest fresh water sources in the world? ""Oh we drink from this water, let's let industries dump their waste in it."" The Ottawa River also gets closed due to e-coli, I never stopped to think where all the poop was coming from. Now I'm eager to find out."

We‚Äôve slowly begun to outgrow the old Rust Belt city identity and are beginning to really get national recognization for our art and architecture. It‚Äôs still going to take years but with the dynamics of our working culture shifting due to covid, the threat of sea level rise, plus access to Lake Erie and Ontario, relatively low cost of living, and the overall shift from the suburbs back to city centers Buffalo is beginning to look mighty attractive to a lot of younger people. I‚Äôve been dancing around the idea of moving for years but lately I‚Äôve started to enjoy the idea of just staying.

If the squeeze happens, the former will occur, but faster, bombing markets and probably leading to a default.

Lastly, waiting as long as they can to see the price fall, is the only option. They should have taken losses at $40 mark, but like everything, that is in hindsight.

When ever the squeeze occurs, I plan to feed out my stocks slowly to try to cover my cost inserted (44 @ 180) and then ride out what happens with the rest.

While technically we could see infinity, that won't occur IMHO. Just make sure you cover and have fun.

2689,Something's in the water of Lake Erie and Huron...
2690,"""Lake Erie""


Bro there are 31,000 lakes in Canada...you picked the one with the most ship traffic. The one that connects 4 of the largest US cities on the map. Of course it's going to be polluted"
2691,"Like others have said, the only thing to really worry about is if there is an algae bloom going on, but they normally don't happen near CP and only happen for a somewhat short time. The beach at CP isn't really known to have bacterial issues like some beaches (due to waterfowl poo and the like). It is a big body of natural water with animals in it, so it isn't going to be like pool water, but unless you have serious health issues, I wouldn't be wary of swimming in it, just don't go drinking it (the same could be said for clear mountain streams).

Lake Erie is a clay bottomed lake, so there is a fair amount of sediment floating around, so it can look ""dirty"" or polluted up close. It is just sedimentary particles, nothing to be worried about.

Cedar Point's beach is pretty nice, and it is a nice beach to swim at, as the water deepens at a nice gradual pace, so it is easy to find a nice spot that is just right. The sand is normally clean, and it is decently long, so there is plenty of room and you're not crowded all together.

I never experienced any severe undertow or riptides at CP's beach, but I would assume if there was a risk of some they would change the status to yellow or red."
2692,"Eh. It's already trashed. Over half of its lakes are listed as impaired and you probably don't want to swim in them or eat fish from them. 
I imagine the western end of Lake Superior will eventually bloom green like western Lake Erie. Duluth will be the new Cleveland.

Adding:. Duluth has had a few ""once in a lifetime"" storms recently, 2012 in particular but also 2019:

""Back at the Lakefront, crashing waves punished the shoreline where Duluth‚Äôs Lakewalk used to be a favorite of visitors.

‚ÄúIt used to be right here,‚Äù said Randy Brody. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been destroyed by previous storms and it hasn‚Äôt been rebuilt yet.‚Äù

At an evening press conference, Duluth Mayor Emily Larson raised the issue of climate change in relation to the storms.

‚ÄúYes, that‚Äôs a different press conference,‚Äù Larson said, ‚Äúbut we are definitely seeing them more often and with greater severity.‚Äù

2706,"Better, WAY better! I grew up in sixties/seventies and the only thing that I remember being better then was college tuition and maybe politicians; everything else was worse! Crime and war wise, we live in the safest time to be alive. In the sixties women were often looked at as property of their husbands and minorities were second-class citizens. Lake Erie and the Delaware River (among others) were dead! Dead, as in, nothing could live in them! And they smelled horrible so you couldn't use them for recreation. Cars broke down at least monthly. Music was completely controlled by record companies and radio stations. And I forget what I was going to say here.

Anyway, I'm sure I'm missing something, but overall things are pretty great right now in comparison to fifty years ago.

They can't call them the N word or Lynch them or any of the horrible things that we have done, so they kill them by poisoning their water by changing their water source from the glacial waters of Lake Erie to the cesspool the flint river.  To top it off they don't properly treat the water despite having an infinite amount of cash and legions of scientist as hand.  They can't overtly murder them so they murder their hopes and dreams by covertly engaging in acts of ecoterrorism.  There is one party that overtly poisons the people of this nation through the deregulation of corporations and allow unfettered capitalism to destroy the planet, poison the water, air and earth and then deny our citizens what every other industrialized nation has, universal health care.

2709,"Lake Erie freezes over enough to cross somewhat regularly - at least it did before climate change. Last I heard a guy from Windsor did it back in the 1970s. There's a story (apocryphal perhaps) that some American invaders crossed the lake from Ohio into Ontario during the war of 1812.

As the shallowest lake, it can also have some incredibly damaging storms &amp; it is quickly eroding some of the bluffs nearby, causing road closures &amp; relocations."

2714,"I've homebrewed Cleveland and Pittsburgh when I first got into shadowrun as a fun activity. I often pull up history from the city, local areas, urban legends, and cool local trivia to build em up. For cleveland some stuff I added what I think still fit the spirit of shadowrun:

* the Cuyahoga river is always on fire, causing a rip in the astral plane 
* a corporate hospital war between 3 local subsidaries
* a local lesser dragon lair on lake Erie
* Militant Amish seceeding from corporate land
* a cult dedicated to Lebron James 
* the cleveland mafia resurging and setting base in Little Italy
* whatever else I could pull from the fun [parody](https://youtu.be/oZzgAjjuqZM)"
2715,Northeast Ohio has some pretty parts too. Cuyahoga Valley National park is pretty dope. Cleveland also  has some lowkey pretty metro parks and occasionally Lake Erie is good for some great coastal shots.
2716,"Lake Erie is usually fine to swim in. There are algae blooms sometimes that make it unsafe, but pollution isn't the issue it was back when they lived up there."
2717,Lake Erie can get kinda gross but in general it's fine to swim in. The big thing to watch out for is algae blooms which can be hazardous. A lot of beaches have a warning system noting daily what the water is like and if it's good to swim in.
2718,Damn. Probably. We only got steak and lobster at the end of the fiscal year. Lake Erie #Plankowner
2719,"It's not just toxic algae blooms - I mean that's a legitimate concern, but lakes and rivers in this area are more vulnerable to eutrophication than anything - maybe not something as large as Lake Erie, but the rivers and other small bodies of water are vulnerable. 

It's somewhat straightforward:

- Phosphorous and to a lesser extent, nitrogen ends up running off of fields. Luckily, nitrogen-based fertilizers aren't as effective at causing phytoplankton growth, and phosphorus-based fertilizers, while they're very, very good at causing growth, they're ""sticky"" so they have a harder time getting to bodies of water from where they're applied. 
 - UNfortunately, so much of both is being used that they make their way there anyway. 
- Phytoplankton (including algae) eat up the fertilizer
 - Some of the blooms are toxic, others just cause more water turbidity
- Zooplankton eat the algae, reproduce, eat more
- Fish eat the zooplankton, reproduce, at as much as they can
- Algae is depleted, and a massive population of zooplankton starve. Zooplankton is depleted, and all the fish begin to starve
- You are left with, eventually, if left unmitigated, a beautiful sparkling blue lake that's completely dead. 

Some of the smaller finger lakes went through bouts of eutrophication like this. This is going back a number of years, but I think I recall Skaneateles lake going through this. All the nearby farmland runoff eventually killed the lake as described (lots of pig farms with very, very, very phosphorous-rich byproducts (poop). 

***

The bulk of the effects are not going to be tied to residential use of retail fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides. That runoff is minimal and often gets broken down or processed before it can make it to a larger body of water, and when it gets there, the amounts are too small to be troubling. The major concern is large farm use of these things, as the quantities are very high (glyphosate application essentially ends up with an entire field saturated in RoundUp as if a heavy rain just pummeled the area). 

***

Overall, we need to work hard to:

- Manage farm fertilizer and poop runoff
- Understand and manage the runoff coming from heavy glyphosate use
- Continue to manage and protect the Lake Erie and surrounding lakes/rivers' watersheds
- Worry less about what John Smith is buying at Walmart for his lawn, and worry more about what farmer john, golf courses, and large ""mow the grass"" parks are doing to manage their vegetation."
2720,"Lived for a month in July on Long Point, Ontario facing Lake Erie once. This was about five years ago. This is a piece of land that sticks out into Lake Erie. 

I'd take a walk every morning along the shore because it was great. 

Toxic blooms in the lake made the water stink and the health department was always on edge as to whether to ban swimming or not. It was always stupid, one week it was ok, next week it wasn't. The advisories were always just a few points away from stopping people. I'd go swimming but only for very short periods and a very good shower immediately after. 

And on my walks along the beach? There were dead fish that regularly washed up and on the first week of July was the worst with hundreds of dead fish every mile and it literally stank up the shoreline for miles. 

The Great Lakes, especially Lake Erie, aren't getting worse, they are already terrible."

2723,This is the equivalent of peeing in lake Erie. Like the pollution from a fracking well is going to register on the scale of steel mill.
2724,"No disrespect but Lake erie is my least favourite great lake. It's too prone to algae blooms, and it's pretty turbid. I prefer Georgian Bay or any of the vast number of lakes in North-central Ontario.  Erie is good for fishing though, ill give it that."
2725,We have bigger fish to fry.  A single tanker on Lake Erie puts out more pollution than a person will in their entire lifetime.  The 15 biggest tankers in the world put out more pollution than every other vehicle on Earth combined.
2726,"To first answer your question before writing a bunch of possibly TL;DR stuff, many cities use full capture devices to prevent trash from going into the ocean and/or ending up on beaches. I've never seen Mr. Trash Wheel before, but it appears to be just a device that removes the trash once it is captured in the net. Full capture is an end-of-pipe solution, but there are also ways to prevent trash from entering storm drains in the first place. [Here's the EPA page on various trash capture technologies.](https://www.epa.gov/trash-free-waters/trash-capture-technologies)The easiest solution would be to make sure no trash ends up on the street in the first place, but public behavior isn't that easy to sway. It takes decades, and can be reversed. 

As far as how much trash makes it out to the deep ocean, or to the garbage patch, I have no idea. It comes from countries all over the Pacific Rim, but most comes from China, Indonesia, Vietnam, and some other East- and Southeast Asian countries.

\--

I love my job because I feel like I'm helping to make the world a better place, and I work with a bunch of people who share the sentiment. We could also go work in private industry and make more money, but we're passionate about what we do. I just wanted to shed some light on the situation because it can feel like no one cares and no one is doing anything. Before I started working at the Water Board, none of this was apparent.  When I was reading our TMDL for trash and debris in Santa Monica Bay, I realized why the city of Manhattan Beach had banned smoking outdoors and polystyrene; if municipalities outlaw certain disposable items that often end up in storm drains, they get a few extra years to come into compliance with all the other requirements.

Having the resources and time to crunch the data is only the beginning, and the shortest step in the process. Dischargers need to change their processes and that can take years. Sometimes infrastructure needs to be retired, altered, or built. The final compliance deadline for California power plants to stop using once-through cooling water, for example, is 20 years for one facility. Another facility knew it would not be able to meet the requirements and chose to cease operations. That may be fine for one low-output power plant, but cities will flood if the storm drains were not operational. Parts of the San Fernando flood anyway even with functional drains. 

Have you ever been at working waiting on someone to give you something so you could do their job, but they're waiting on someone, and that person is waiting on someone, and so on? It's kind of like that. There are so many moving pieces not even counting red tape, that changes take years and years. I know its frustrating when it seems like we don't have time. New solutions are being developed all the time, like the city of Santa Monica's Urban Runoff Recycling Facility, which recovers dry weather urban runoff and removes pollutants so the water can be used for non-potable purposes."
2727,"I would bring it with you, I kayak all the time here in the summers. We have a ton of drop in sites along Lake Erie and the Cuyahoga and Rocky Rivers, not to mention all the smaller lakes and rivers in the area."
2728,"You've got the right attitude lol.  The ""they're dumping raw sewage!"" thing gets a lot of press, as it should but it's hard pointing out ""the problem isn't that it happened once, it's that it happens repeatidly"".  And I don't want to short sell that.  ""Over fertilizing"" the water can be fatal.  Some of those microbes that grow cause infections, and just a few years ago in Toledo Ohio (where lake Erie gets more shallow and therefore warmer) they had some deaths because of an toxic algae bloom the drinking water plant wasn't built to handle.

But it's funny, stateside, there's a growing push for recycled water (ie: toilet to tap).  I doubt Canada will ever have a need, but California sure does.  It gets pushback for the optics, but I always kind of laugh.  Like, sure you picture a nice mountain stream or whatever but what do you think is in natural water ways?  Bear scat, dead deer, dead fish."
2729,ya... just dump it in lake Erie!
2730,Don‚Äôt pollute our environment with fossil fuels.  Go solar and wind like other countries have successfully done.  Our children will thank us.

2733,"Just now getting a chance to respond. Sorry about that. Long story short is that diversity is key in any ecosystem. Occasionally you'll get a species that comes in and overproduces and overeats and can really throw off the balance and can cause make issues to both other native species and humans. These are typically invasive species (i.e. zebra mussels, bush honeysuckle, etc.) But sometimes it can be a native species that just has the right at of circumstances which is what is happening now. USFWS has seen this kind of thing happen time and time again over decades and is trying to head it off before it becomes a major issue in a couple more years (hurting native bird species by destroying habitat and food sources as well as destroying sport fishing in lake Erie)"

Lake Erie was declared dead. The Cuyahoga, Little Calumet, and Hudson Rivers were all too toxic to support anything but the most pitiful fish. Unchecked, sportsmen and commercial fishermen absolutely annihilate salmon and trout populations. The fact that we have any of those animals left living in clean habitats where you can hunt or fish or simply enjoy them is paid for by those boat tags, deer tags, and licenses.

The space shot transitioning to Amos's first scene this episode shows snow down to roughly the southern tip of New Jersey, so anything south of that is a definite no on the prison location, and kinda contradicts that it's nuclear winter. A column of smoke in the same shot reinforces the Harrisburg area as the impact site.

My best guess is that the prison was on/near Lake Erie or possibly the Allegheny river where it forms a reservoir behind Kinzua Dam. The conservancy zone is a reclaimed Allegheny National forest. And it's just normal winter and not nuclear winter. There's a lot that contradicts that (the burning city on the horizon doesn't match with one in the real world unless St. Marys really took off, the fact that they go out of their way to make the sun/moon comment implies nuclear winter even though the prison was experiencing an actual winter before impact), but it has more supporting evidence than any other location."

Lest there be any confusion, agricultural runoff is western Lake Erie‚Äôs biggest source of algae-forming nutrients.

A third Ohio Environmental Protection Agency study since 2016 has confirmed that through science, firming up past conclusions.  

The agency has been doing that through so-called ‚Äúnutrient mass balance‚Äù studies which look at data that tracks algae-forming phosphorus across the state.

In 2015, the Ohio General Assembly passed a law requiring them to be done once every two years.

That decision came in response to Toledo‚Äôs 2014 algae-driven water crisis, when the city‚Äôs tap water was deemed unsafe to drink or touch over the first weekend of August that year because an algal poison from the lake had breached the city‚Äôs treatment system.

For those studies, the Ohio EPA uses the best available data to determine the percentages of algae-growing phosphorus and nitrogen coming from non-point sources - primarily farm runoff - or point sources, typically sewage treatment plants and their system overflows.

Northwest Ohio‚Äôs Maumee and Sandusky rivers were among 11 watersheds examined across the state.

The most recent report, issued on Christmas Eve, didn‚Äôt deviate much from the 2018 study - not that anyone expected a large shift within such a relatively short amount of time.

The latest report shows 89 percent of the Maumee River‚Äôs phosphorus comes from non-point sources such as agricultural runoff, compared to 88 percent in 2018.

It also shows non-point sources - again, primarily agriculture - account for 92 percent of the Sandusky River‚Äôs phosphorus now, compared to 93 percent in 2018.

Percentages vary from stream to stream, but - for much of the state - consistently show agriculture as a primary driver. One exception is the Cuyahoga River watershed near Cleveland, because it is much more urbanized than streams in northwest Ohio and elsewhere.

‚ÄúSignificant changes generally are not expected over a short time period,‚Äù Heidi Griesmer, Ohio EPA spokesman, said. ‚ÄúHowever, in addition to being required by law every two years, the nutrient studies help us track trends over short periods. Over longer periods, the data compiled will identify whether significant changes are occurring. The next report is due in 2022 and will include nine years of data for comparison.‚Äù

Ty Higgins, Ohio Farm Bureau Federation spokesman, said there ‚Äúis simply not enough data to show any definitive trends‚Äù yet.

‚ÄúBut he agreed the findings, along with other current water quality research, are ‚Äúkey components to finding science-based solutions for clean water and more data will certainly be helpful as future studies are released.‚Äù

Phosphorus is the nutrient most closely associated with algal bloom sizes, while nitrogen often influences toxicity.

One reason for the heavy input from agriculture: Seventy-nine percent of the Maumee River watershed‚Äôs land is in agricultural production.

In the Sandusky River watershed, 80 percent of the land is in agricultural production.

Runoff figures in spring and early summer ‚Äî when most of the fertilizers are applied ‚Äî often are dictated by not only volumes of rainfall between March 1 and July 31, but also the severity, timing, and duration of thunderstorms, experts have said.

Ms. Griesmer said the latest study ‚Äúconfirms information from previous [nutrient mass balance] work about phosphorus loading.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis information confirms that H2Ohio is on the right path in focusing on the agricultural sources of phosphorus running into the western basin of Lake Erie,‚Äù she said.

Shelby Croft, Ohio Department of Agriculture spokesman, said that agency has been focused on water quality issues for years. It, too, has confidence in the DeWine administration‚Äôs H2Ohio program, although she did not rule out the possibility of adjustments as more science comes in.

‚ÄúODA has learned many things about delivering the H2Ohio program in the past 11 months, and undoubtedly what we‚Äôve learned will lead to tweaks in program structure and delivery methods in the future,‚Äù she said.

Ms. Croft said the state agriculture department remains committed to programs based around voluntary incentives.

‚ÄúMoving forward, additional research and monitoring data will likely cause adjustments to [best management practices] offered through the program, or may bring new practices into the program,‚Äù she said.

Environmentalists said they saw shortcomings in the latest report.

Pam Taylor of Environmentally Concerned Citizens of South Central Michigan said it‚Äôs ‚Äúno surprise that the watersheds in northwest Ohio continue to be highest nonpoint sources of phosphorus.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe continue to test the water in Michigan‚Äôs portion of both the Maumee and Raisin watersheds, as we‚Äôve done for 20 years, and have seen no improvement,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúUntil the application of liquid manure over subsurface drain tiles is restricted in the western Lake Erie region, and until the states involved and the U.S. EPA demand accountability in the form of water tests instead of soil tests or evidence of best practices, nothing will change and the millions of dollars spent on remediation for harmful algae and bacterial pollution problems here will continue to be wasted.‚Äù

Mike Ferner, Advocates for a Clean Lake Erie founder, described the report as ‚Äútwo more years of [the Ohio EPA] kicking the can down the road, telling us what we already know: the lion‚Äôs share of what‚Äôs poisoning Lake Erie comes from agriculture.‚Äù

Sandy Bihn, Lake Erie Waterkeeper founder, said this and previous reports ‚Äúare remiss in reporting the massive increases‚Äù in manure generated by livestock facilities close to or large enough to be known as concentrated animal feeding operations, or CAFOs.

‚ÄúFailing to disclose major manure increases in the Maumee and failing to divide agriculture into commercial fertilizer and manure means that Ohio wants to tout the H2O rhetoric to make it look like Ohio cares about Lake Erie, but in reality Ohio is doing little to nothing to reduce manure sources,‚Äù she said.

2787,"Ohio has one national forest, the Wayne national forest, and a single national Park, Cuyahoga Valley. There are many places of underappreciated beauty in Ohio, but the beauty we find in nature in Ohio is often less obvious, yet still very interesting. We have few wetlands left, we have ato the Appalachian region to the south east and east, The Ohio River Valley region is very distinctly different than than the lake Erie region. Western Ohio also is technically part of the great plains eco-region. We have some small Prairie remnants left, but funnily enough not in western Ohio and only essentially in southern and central Ohio. There are many less waterfalls, our mountains are often subjugated to be called Hills or even not even acknowledged or known to exist by many Ohioans. Very much overlooked are our sensitive species, our threatened and endangered species. We still have ecology like anywhere else, but because 98% of Ohio was deforested at one moment in time in the last 150 years, pretty much all Old growth is gone, Save a few select sites that are mostly inaccessible to the public. Many counties do not even have park districts due to funding and or lack of support, but there are still many people that value the outdoors, but I think those people in Ohio are generally new to the concept of outdoors and what that means. Camping mean taking your 30 foot trailer with you the most Ohioans, and hikes are usually on paved or gravel trails in metro park systems in and around urban centers or suburban areas. Places are actively being developed. The state nature preserve system is very underfunded and also heavily trafficked. Our state parks are almost solely managed for large campers and campgrounds and not for ecology and nature."

2791,"I know what it was like I lived it buddy, the water in flint has been bad since the early 90‚Äôs and I‚Äôam not just discussing the lead, heck even where I grew up in Macomb county the water wasn‚Äôt stellar because we all were connected to the Detroit water supply which at one point in the 90‚Äôs came from lake St. Clair, Lake Huron and Lake Erie; two of which in the mid 90‚Äôs were condemned to swim in because the state environmental team claimed they were not sanitary. Even worse the pipes in flint should have been replaced years upon years ago as most of their water system pipes are older then my father at nearly 60, even more suspect is the switch to the flint river which was not even synders fault (the move to switch to it was) but the upkeep and the treatment of that river falls on the powers before Snyder and that goes back even further then 1981."
2792,"Although there are rare times that an invasive species can come into an ecosystem and actually improve it. Case in point would be the zebra mussels when they showed up in Lake Erie in the 1980s. That Lake was so murky and polluted you couldn't see more than 3 ft into it on a good day, now you can see the bottom from 30 ft above on a good day. The zebra mussels are definitely a nuisance, especially for boat owners and any water intake systems but they sure filtered that Lake and cleaned it up in a way that nothing else could have. Now we have a thriving population of perch, one of the world's best fisheries for walleye, and a population of steelhead and salmon that are on the rise big time. When I was a kid you were lucky to even hear of somebody catching a steelhead out of Lake Erie."
2793,"They definitely had a major part in cleaning up Lake Erie. That Lake was dying at one time. I could see them being devastating to small inland lakes, but on Lake Erie they seem to have kind of fallen right into their place in the ecosystem. Everybody freaked out when the gobies were being discovered in Lake Erie, and now all of a sudden they have found their place in the food chain. I find gobies inside of walleye and perch bellies all the time. I'm not saying invasive species should be put anywhere on purpose, but they definitely had a hand in cleaning up Lake Erie."
2794,"Lake erie's biggest problem is fertilizer runoff. Every year we get the toxic algae blooms on the west basin where it's super shallow and gets warm real fast. And Northwest Ohio is nothing but corn and soybean fields with irrigation canals running from field to field carrying fertilizer right back out to the lake. And yes the zebra mussels do have a huge impact on the zoo Plankton and phytoplankton which obviously feed The bait fish that feed game fish, but the truth about zebra mussels is they're not going to go anywhere we're stuck with them. Even sheephead (drum) aren't native to Lake Erie, but the lake seems to be doing okay with them there.  Crazy..."
2795,Man you just sparked a meta thread about not arguing about what‚Äôs a ‚Äústeelhead‚Äù and what ‚Äúisn‚Äôt recommended to be eaten twice a week due to mercury in Lake Erie‚Äù
2796,"I am drinking water from lake Erie filtered by the city and by me with a brita.  I am going to die regardless, at least I don't give money to the scumbags of nestle and fill the world with plastic."
2797,"That‚Äôs just not true though. Hunting is not a blanket solution: if everyone hunted, wild game animals would go extinct immediately; there simply isn‚Äôt enough of them to sustain billions of people. Fishing is dangerous, too, with nearly all saltwater fish being precariously overfished already, and freshwater fish are often understudied, underregulated, and threatened as well (see Asian carp, lampreys, and look into ‚Äòtire dust,‚Äô and further, consider that the climate is changing- here by the Great Lakes, for example, Lake Erie has had some 1.5% ice cover so far, while the average by this time is at 15%. This means a LOT to the animals living in the lake as it greatly affects clarity of environment aka feeding for fish). Local farmers are, yes, generally more eco-friendly than factory farms, but since about 99% of all animal products come from factory farms (99.9% of eggs), it‚Äôs pretty likely neither you nor any of your friends are shopping local family farms (Source; sentience institute via USDA &amp; epa). Additionally, in a horribly sad irony, local/humane farming is STILL not sustainable, and perhaps less so than factory farms. There is simply not enough land to raise all those billions of animals humanely- animal agriculture already takes up 50% of usable land, and 80% of food crops go to feeding animal agriculture. 

So, while perhaps there is variance to how destructive an animal-based diet is, it remains that eating plant based is the ONLY ethical option.

Plant based is hardly extreme. What‚Äôs extreme is having the option to eat a less environmentally destructive diet during the sixth great extinction, and not."

The Cuyahoga River ( KY-…ô-HOG-…ô, or KY-…ô-HOH-g…ô ) is a river in the United States, located in Northeast Ohio, that bisects the city of Cleveland and feeds into Lake Erie. As Cleveland emerged as a major center for manufacturing, the river became heavily affected by industrial pollution, so much so that it ""caught fire"" at least 13 times, most famously on June 22, 1969, helping to spur the American environmental movement. Since then, the river has been extensively cleaned up through the efforts of Cleveland's city government and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA). In 2019, the American Rivers conservation association named the Cuyahoga ""River of the Year"" in honor of ""50 years of environmental resurgence.""

There's also been a substantial increases in the mayfly hatch from year to year which is directly related to better water quality.


I've been fishing Lake Erie my entire life and have witnessed the algae blooms. So when I see posts like this it's a reminder of how far we've come and how far we still have to go. The best way IMO to support change is to buy a fishing license from any the Great Lakes states. State DNR's do the most for research, awareness, and prevention. Fishing can also be an effective way to teach our youth an appreciation for the outdoors and hopefully be the driving force of change for the future."

2865,"&gt; Profit-driven enterprises have no reason to care about the environment

Yes they have, when that environment is privately owned. Because the owners of the property will try to protect it, the aggressors on the property would have to stop the invasion and pay for the damage they caused.

The main characteristic of the market is not the collection of profits without any consequences and rules, in fact it is a characteristic of the state in collecting taxes. The state can collect taxes by force, but a private company cannot make a profit by violating other people's property rights. The main characteristic of the market is the system of property rights.

Go back to what I said

&gt; The market cannot solve problems where the market is not allowed to exist.

&gt; The market cannot solve the problem of air, river and ocean pollution, as long as these resources are state-owned. For example. Pollution problems would have been easily solved if the courts had defended private property.

Anyone has been able to dump polluting garbage and wastes in the waters, for example. But consider what would happen if private firms were able to own the rivers and the lakes. If a private firm owned Lake Erie, for example, then anyone dumping garbage in the lake would be promptly sued in the courts for their aggression against private property and would be forced by the courts to pay damages and to cease and desist from any further aggression.

In fact, it is government officials who have no reason to care about the environment, which has proven to be true through practice, letting state-owned resources be polluted.

&gt; or stopping a meteor from hitting our planet

Private companies solve an unimaginable number of problems, why not this one as well. Private companies are even responsible for weakening the pandemic by producing vaccines. You must have thought why private companies would produce a vaccine ...

&gt; or keeping people at home during a pandemic

I have already explained that the market implies a system of property rights above all, these property rights enable anyone who wants to isolate himself and not let anyone on his private property. In a fully privatized system, there would also be private cities, private streets and more, which would make rules for themselves in relation to the risk they feel. Locking citizens in their homes is a bad way to solve problems, and it also violates basic rights. It's like solving the problem of crime by banning people from going to parts of the city with increased crime..."

&gt;Private companies solve an unimaginable number of problems, why not this one as wel

Because sad as it is, individuals aren't going to voluntarily pay a company to stop a meteor from hitting our planet. This is the type of issue that only public spending is equipped to solve.

If flow rates over the falls stay the same (which they do control, monitor and limit very closely now to ensure diversion to power generation/utility consumption is fair and not drying it up), part of the falls could disappear in 2,000years. Even if these falls have a never ending source of water, the other thing is that the falls‚Äô location is eroding further upstream over time. Although man made intervention could slow this down, the forces of erosion are pretty constant and it will eventually run it all the way back to Lake Erie (in ~50,000years) to turn it into more of a series of rapids versus the massive falls that exist today.

&gt; Lol what are you even talking about, historically Sikhs fought with Muslims against Hindus during the partition.Yeesh

Hey, at least I don't go to Pakistan and argue with the locals with my ignorance like you do. I'm perfectly happy knowing very little about the little shitstain you call a country.

By the way, and we both already know this, I'm clearly referring to before ""Pakistan"" ever existed and there was constantly conflict near Punjab between the Muslims and Hindus which is why the Sikhs had a very militaristic religion, and it's why Guru Nanak promoted the idea that there ""is no Muslim, no Hindus"" etc.. I know you're being purposefully idiotic now, and while I don't mind entertaining you on that, I thought it was worth clarifying."
2874,Tell that to lake erie.
2875,Unfiltered Lake Erie water.

2877,Those things are a nightmare.  A big problem in Lake Erie.
2878,"Yeah, when I was a kid, I had a lot of ear infections. Usually from Lake Erie. Fucked up my hearing something terrible, but I can tell you that the pain can be *incredible*. 

Like a fucking pick jabbing into your ear over and over and over. Worse, is that *nothing* really stops that. Not laying on a heating pad or any of that other home remedy crap. 

I don't see weak, squealy little Philip being able to handle that. He's not a piglet that can take pain stoically. 

To say nothing about how he's always digging into his ears, smearing hair grease, pizza grease, and whatever the fuck else is on his hands into his gouty ears."
2879,I was told a crate of moss balls was dropped in Lake Erie. I‚Äôm from western PA and I know zebra mussels are in the area. Also I know Lake Erie isn‚Äôt the most sanitary body of water. It‚Äôs much better than it used to be though. I can remember a field trip in high school and walking along the beach with tons of dead fish just lying all over the sand.
2880,"Remember when Columbus Ohio thought it would be fun to release 1.5 million balloons for a world record and then all those balloons landed in Lake Erie? Fun times.

Edit: Cleveland"
2881,"What about public property? Like the air and the water?

Before regulation, for example, Lake Erie would occasionally catch fire. Literally on fire, from burning garbage, because the people upstream were dumping the problem on people downstream. Those states downstream could regulate it all they wanted, but the Great Lakes being connected means that everyone had to work together or else states would be forced to set looser regulations for the comparative short-term economic advantage.

Likewise, the air you breathe is affected by EPA pollution mandates. Otherwise, we'd have a smog-filled country because burning coal is cheaper and any oligarchy worth its salt is going to ensure that its poor underclass can't afford the slightly higher cost of environmentally-friendly products.

Libertarianism sounds great because you are able to focus on just the regulations you don't like, and ignore the fact that, before those regulations, the country was a relative shithole. You want a libertarian paradise? Move to Slab City, Nevada. No regulations at all. Enjoy."
2882,"Animal manure, excess fertilizer applied to crops and fields and soil erosion make agriculture the major cause of the algal blooms. Lake Erie has even suffered blooms by¬†fertilizer runoff from industrial corn and soybean farms."
2883,"A walleye!

Seriously though, I'd like to see farmers and golf courses see tightened regulations against using fully soluble nitrogen and phosphorus. By August the lower grand is nearly unfishable with algae, and Lake Erie has its infamous mass of cyanobacteria. These problems will only get worse if we don't do something. It's not like there aren't other kinds of fertilizer, they use what they use now because it's the cheapest thing they can get away with."
2884,Yes. And I appear to live in Lake Erie now.
2885,Lake Erie *is* heavily polluted.
2886,"I live in this voting district, and people have been going crazy since trump too. I think it's something in the water or Lake Erie."
2887,"Agricultural runoff - yes and the main concern is E. Coli contamination, but bacterial contamination is handled by chlorination.  In addition, phosphorus from fertilizer is specifically addressed in water treatment.  Industrial / business / residential pollution - no.  That's dumped into the surface river system, which eventually makes its way to Lake Erie and then out to the ocean via Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence."
2888,"Zebra mussels were discovered in Ohio in the late 1980s from boats/ships dumping ballast in Lake Erie.  It quickly spread throughout the Great Lakes and then throughout several states due to boaters moving their boats from the lake to local smaller lakes and reservoirs. So any part of Canada touching the Great Lakes likely also has issues that have spread in the last 35 years or so.

On the plus side Lake Erie is cleaner than it's been in decades, bad news it's killing native mussel species, blocking water intake pipes, and possibly causing botulism."
2889,Can't wait to be one of the poor fuckers on the southern shores of lake Erie who gets killed when Foundry tries to get coastal access.
2890,"It's much much worse then that. Here in Onterrible they have passed a law to be able to sell off protected habitats like wetlands and preserves to build more condos, sky rises and highways. We have a toll highway that's too expensive so that are building another highway 15 mins away that's also going to be a toll that's slightly cheaper. All the great lakes are poisoned from fertilizer runoff and turning into dead zones. We will lose all that fresh water very soon. Lake Erie and ontario are already fucked and that where we get our drinking water. The water is cleaned using the cheapest and most unhealthy ways.  Using chlorine and alum, there are much healthier ways but that requires a couple bucks and wouldnt kill us poor folk as fast. Soil degradation has us burning through soil 10 time faster then humanly possible to fix it. They have made it illegal to expose the atrocities of animal agriculture, taking away our civil liberties one law at a time. Without a full scale revolution we are heading for a fascist surveillance control state. People are also fucking oblivious here thinking it's a great place to live, when the working class are the working poor. Now the government is offering to buy out your debts and pay you to be a ward of the government, never to own anything in your life."
2891,What happened to the Great Lakes? Lake Erie is practically a river
2892,That dog is super cute. And lake erie is definitely not to be messed with.
2893,"Jokes on your partner!  Eventually the Niagara Escarpment will erode back far enough that Lake Erie will drain into the Atlantic.  But the good news is, if Florida disappears, the Gulf of Mexico will have covered much of the Midwest, so you might still get that beach front property after all."
2894,Tell that to people who get their drinking water from the western Basin of Lake Erie.
2895,"My friend who can't shut up about politics presented a solution to Lake Erie's pollution: 

""Maybe me should stop polluting it"". He's an EPA wonk in training"

2898,"The boomers inherited a world the greatest generation had polluted beyond belief.  Lake Erie routinely used to catch on fire.  The sky over LA was brown.  The ozone layer almost evaporated.  Hundreds of superfund sites had to be cleaned up.  Asbestos and lead paint was in nearly every house.

They got stuck with the cleanup bill and did what was needed to pay for all of that while not losing our standard of living.   Easy for you to criticize.  What they did was much harder.  Yes some of the costs were shifted into the future."
2899,I live 45 minutes from the Lake Michigan coast and try to visit Superior at least once a year so I've been spoiled by nice lakes. Even with improvements I still wouldn't swim in Lake Erie.
2900,"The main source of water in Lake Erie is the Detroit River, I blame the dirty Michiganders."
2901,"Spill sis. Have you seen the mouth of the Cuyahoga River- more specifically the part that connects to Lake Erie? It‚Äôs brown, like a really unhealthy brown. There‚Äôs a reason no one goes swimming in that river it‚Äôs a fucking death trap lmao"

2908,"Location: Lake Erie, Ohio 

Took a walk yesterday and noticed thousands of small fish washing up dead. I‚Äôm not used to seeing so many just floating on the edge of the shore like that. I wonder what pollutant caused it to happen, but it‚Äôs a known fact that the ecosystem in the Great Lakes has been slowly declining for decades."
2909,"Lots of Dr Seuss books got minor editing from one edition to the next. The Lorax used to have a couple lines about how polluted lake Erie is, which was accurate at the time but the lake is largely clean and healthy today so the lines aren't in more recent editions."
2910,"For real, they could have done an electric guitar for Cleveland, the term Rock and Roll was coined by a Cleveland DJ (which is why the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is located there).  They could have also done grapes for wineries on the islands in Lake Erie, airplanes for Dayton (Wright Brothers &amp; National Air Force Museum), ice cream for all of the little ice cream makers all over the state, or even a car for all of the automobiles and parts made here (Jeep in Toledo, Goodyear in Akron)

The aide and I get him to the bathroom, he goes to sit on the toilet when his ass UNLEASHES the shit of the century!  It was dripping from the walls, toilet sink etc.  He turns around and yells ""this looks like a murder scene!  Who has to clean this up?""   Aide got him cleaned up, I went and got a BSC.  Walked up to the nurse who was actually taking care of the patient and and declared ""your patient just exploded"". Housekeeping came in with a roll of paper towels and then left to find the heavy duty stuff, all the while muttering explitives to herself 

2. Quadraplegic on a sand bed -tube fed and in the hospital for a flap reconstruction of her coccyx due to pressure wounds.  Hadn't pooped in DAYS...lets go of a liquid shit the size of Lake Erie.  I call in my charge to help out with rolling and turning (and shit management because I had NO idea how to clean that up).  She grabs the yankauer, flips on the suction and sucks up 1500 cc of liquid shit.  Way easier to manage after that!"
2917,"As someone who grew up on Lake Erie, these things are HORRIBLE and will destroy the water systems out here. Beaches will be more shells than sand and the local ecology will be screwed."
2918,Dunkirk NY! Just south of Buffalo. When you look at the Point in Dunkirk everyone who lives there says the water has risen a lot lately in Lake Erie! It used to be way higher when the older people were kids but it shrunk and there was huge exposed beach and now it's really high again.
2919,"To billion-dollar companies, fines are just ‚Äúthe cost of doing business‚Äù when the profits from illegal activity are far greater than the fine itself. 

This is true for every free market in general, not just the stock market. I‚Äôve seen major manufacturing companies here in my home state of Ohio dump their toxic waste into Lake Erie for years, causing toxic algae blooms in the summer months. It‚Äôs cheaper for them to illegally dump their toxic waste and then simply write a check to the EPA for their fine, rather than actually pay to have their toxic waste disposed of properly. These toxic algae blooms have devastated communities along the shores of Lake Erie for years.

When a large corporation is fined for illegal behavior, that fine needs to be a percentage of their revenue. Say, 5-10% of their bottom line. And if they do it again, the percentage increases to 10-15%. That‚Äôs the only way any fine will actually force a billion-dollar company to change their illegal behavior. 

A $275K fine to a billion-dollar hedge fund is nothing. They‚Äôre probably paying their wives‚Äô boyfriends more than that every week"
2920,"Having personally shat in a hue of green for two days straight after swimming in Lake Erie, I must emphatically refute this assertion."
2921,"Just make it a park, forget the golf course. Golf courses are half the reason Lake Erie has algae problems anyway."
2922,"I wonder if there has been a noticeable increase in detectable fecal coliform in the surface waters around Portland because of the homeless problem. Dogs make a huge impact on  this, and if the state doesn‚Äôt meet EPA required TMDL levels they could get their peepees slapped."
2923,"Good, because we have two kinds of fish in Ohio,  Those that have lots of mercury and those that lots of mercury.  It's a sin what we have done to our lakes.  Lake Erie used to have a fishing industry.  Now no more than two servings per month is advised."
2924,"This is wrong. 

I'm not going to speak about Detroit or Milwaukee  but Cleveland is totally fucked. What does Cleveland have going for it?

1. Rock and roll museum

2. Lake erie


Now lake Erie should be a huge, huge draw. The puget sound houses are worth 5 million minimum even 100 miles from Seattle. Howver lake Erie houses are like around 2 million max. 

Why? Lake Erie is unbelievably  fucking disgusting. I lived maybe 10 minutes driving from it and never went there because you can't swim, you can boat I guess but it fuvking smells.


Also the water is so polluted its not uncommon that you simply can't drink the water and there will be a boil order. 

Also Cleveland is really fucking cold. And its downtown has some lifeless tall buildings (not skyscrapers, like 6 stories) that block what little sun they get so its always cold as fuck."
2925,"How clean/swimmable is Lake Michigan compared to Lake Erie?  Spent a day kayaking on the latter, and was legit grossed out most of the time (not from CLE or the midwest, and that was the first Great Lake I've seen/been to).  Chicago has always been on my bucket list."
2926,"The weather in spring along Lake Erie bounces around a lot because of changes in wind direction. If we get a good south wind, it cancels out the cold lake breeze and we see very nice warm temperatures. If the wind comes from the west or especially the north, we get at least some lake breeze, or a lot of one, and all that cold water keeps us chilly, while Columbus or Pittsburgh has a pleasantly warm day. It works the other way too, though...Cbus and Pittsburgh can drop below freezing while Lake Erie keeps Cleveland above freezing. All that water really has huge effects on our weather and climate here."
2927,I live right by lake Erie and do not take advantage of it enough. Thank you for the inspiration!
2928,"This is why I hunt. As I responded to another comment, I eat meat 2-3 times a week. That meat is stuff I've harvested myself.

Factory farms are wrong. So is monocrop agriculture. So is using nitrogen and phosphorus rich fertilizers. Lake Erie is dead because of algae blooms, that are directly caused by intensive farming practices.

Instead of posing inflammatory questions and statements, please just sit down with people and have a conversation. I eat plant based when I can. I can't digest beans, lentils, etc properly. This is why so still need meat in my diet."
2929,"Native toledoan here. The site of the park is a public park now called Cullen Park. You can visit and walk out on the point into the bay.

Its really located at the mouth of the Maumee River. You can see reeds growing in the shallow water there. Islands built from dredging have unfortunately obstructed many views out to Lake Erie."
2930,"While I agree DNR can be a pan in the ass, it's not necessarily a bad thing. The world's oceans are being over fished and depleted at a rapid rate. Meanwhile, Lake Erie is seeing increases fish populations across the board especially Walleye. I don't think DNR deserves all the credit but they definitely play and important roll in the health of the lake."
2931,"Additional fun fact: Niagara Falls erodes away 3 feet of land every year, so in a few thousand years it will work it‚Äôs way all the way back to Lake Erie. When that happens that 300 foot drop in elevation will be *at* the lake causing it and much of the Great Lakes to drain away."
2932,I thought the Cuyahoga River catching on fire also contributed to the warm Lake Erie water.
2933,I think it's time Lake Erie is downgraded to a Great Pond.
2934,"HABs, (harmful algae blooms) are very very present in Lake Erie, largely due to agricultural runoff. By far the most polluted of the Great Lakes"
2935,"It's funny, my Mom grew up in Buffalo in the 1970s. Back then, the beaches had signs advising you not to swim, because Lake Erie had been made lifeless and poisonous by all the raw sewage and industrial effluent being dumped into it. At the same time, the Salton Sea was still a popular tourist destination. 50 years later, fish have returned to Erie while the Salton is in much worse shape than Erie ever was. 

The Salton is basically our Aral Sea, or it would be like if the Aral Sea was located 100 miles upwind of Moscow."
2936,"In Cleveland, on Lake Erie if it rains heavily they have a water advisory where you aren‚Äôt allowed in the water due to poo run off. 
I believe this is from old/illegal sewer hookups where the poo sewers overflow into the storm sewers. I‚Äôm sure you can google articles about Lake Erie beach advisories"
2937,There's a nuke plant on the shores of Lake Erie. You used to be able to fish near the hot water output as the fish like warmer water. Now if your boat gets anywhere near there you are intercepted by security.

I buy my energy through a Renewable Energy Certificate program, and I am the proud owner-driver of a Chevrolet Bolt. When it comes to the State House, there‚Äôs a lot we need to do:¬†

Water (non-infrastructural component)

* Prioritize mitigation of PFAS/PFOA/PFOS at the state level
* Support state laws that would make PFAS/PFOA/PFOS testing required more often and in more districts.
* Great Lakes
* Protect the integrity of the Great Lakes Compact, which supports the Great Lake states and prevents siphoning off the water to the rest of the country
* Demand equitable and sustainable business contracts assuring that businesses that use our state's greatest resource pay fair prices to do so.
* Collaborate with researchers and the agricultural industry to reduce nutrient runoff and Lake Erie algal blooms.
* Erect ‚Äúrainy day funds‚Äù to anticipate the impacts of climate change.
* Renewable energy
* Support the transition to less carbon-intensive fuels immediately and the R&amp;D needed to transition to a carbon-neutral fuel economy as soon as possible
* Support our energy partners in further developing and expanding our state‚Äôs energy infrastructure to be better equipped to equitably distribute the highly-demanded, carbon-neutral energy of the future
* Support science-based legislation when creating agricultural policy
* Expand our state‚Äôs electric vehicle charging station grid
* Supports maintaining and building on the 2016 Energy law which
   * Created electric resource adequacy and Integrated Resource Planning requirement to ensure there are enough energy resources in place to meet the reliability needs of all of Michigan‚Äôs electric customers.
   * Ensured that Michigan was receiving the most efficient energy and the best value available.
   * Raised the state renewable energy standard from 10% to 15% and also more clean energy efficiency requirements
   * Established 35% renewable energy goal by 2025"
2940,"Hey there! You are absolutely right, and as a national security-oriented Millennial, I am tracking water security globally, very aware of Michigan‚Äôs position as one of the best places on the planet. While it is not an issue right now, I anticipate that incoming climate refugees will end up being one of our state‚Äôs biggest issues throughout the late 21st Century. Until then, though, there is a lot we need to be doing to even get our state up to pace with where we should already be. Below is a compilation of my thoughts. I know this is a lot of information, but I wanted to make sure I could provide all of this to you:

* Water &amp; Great Lakes¬†
   * Prioritize mitigation of PFAS/PFOA/PFOS at the state level
   * Support state laws that would make PFAS/PFOA/PFOS testing required more often and in more districts.
   * Continuing PFAS remediation to prevent future contamination
   * Overturning these DEQ/MEGLE lobbyist regulatory oversight boards
   * Support eliminating the Environmental Rules Review Committee
   * Collaborate with researchers and the agricultural industry to reduce nutrient runoff and Lake Erie algal blooms.
   * Erect ‚Äúrainy day funds‚Äù to anticipate the impacts of climate change.
* Renewable energy
   * Support switching to ethanol and related biomass fuel sources as excellent options of renewable fuel¬†
   * Support science-based legislation when creating agricultural policy
* Supports maintaining and building on the 2016 Energy law
   * Created electric resource adequacy and Integrated Resource Planning requirement to ensure there are enough energy resources in place to meet the reliability needs of all of Michigan‚Äôs electric customers.

   * Raised the state renewable energy standard from 10% to 15% and also more clean energy efficiency requirements
   * Established 35% renewable energy goal by 2025
* Support investing in and modernizing the natural gas delivery system to result in safer, affordable, reliable and cleaner natural gas, as a transitional fuel from our carbon-intensive present to a carbon-neutral future
* Support policies that provide financial incentives for utilities to offer innovative programs such as demand response and energy efficiency that result in less energy sales
* Support policies that provide financial incentives for utilities to implement innovative clean energy pilots
* Support policies that support expanding the electric vehicle (EV) market in Michigan
* Support policies that incentivize implementation of expanded EV charging stations"
2941,"Bar manager here. We're taking every precaution mandated by the state (Ohio), but most customers ignore or forget distancing requirements, many as soon as they enter. Younger groups in particular often exchange hugs on entry. (While masks and staggered seating might be a pain, I don't see how ""no hugging"" is a particularly difficult concession to make.)

I think we'll be shut down again soon, possibly even by this weekend. DeWine didn't bat an eye closing all the bars 2 days before St. Patrick's Day, so it's possible he'll need to shut down July 4th weekend as well. Our main location for drinking tourists, a Lake Erie island, recently confirmed 7 cases directly linked to their bars. A hub like that will be *packed* this weekend. Even if the bars somehow enforce distancing rules, nobody will have the authority to control all the contact that will happen on busy streets, which will be teeming with tourists overflowing from reduced-capacity establishments. 

If no action is taken, I'd be shocked if that island alone doesn't spread hundreds of carriers over hundreds of miles by Monday."
2942,"Have a beach day at Lake Erie. There are a couple of clean spots in Huron that my family goes to. Old Woman's Creek is a good walk, also lots of piers and cool views of the lake."
2943,"In the early 70s you had the iconic crying Indian commercial as well as ‚Äúgive a hoot, don‚Äôt pollute.‚Äù  

And then there‚Äôs environmental issues with dumping chemicals into natural bodies of water.  Lake Erie and the Rhine River caught on fire.

We really treated our environment poorly.  The only explanation I have is that society was rapidly evolving from a horse and buggy mentality to a fully mechanized and industrial one, and that sooner or later the impact had to be dealt with."
2944,"from the Chippewa on down
Of the big lake they called Gitche Gumee
The lake, it is said, never gives up her dead
When the skies of November turn gloomy
With a load of iron ore twenty-six thousand tons more
Than the Edmund Fitzgerald weighed empty
That good ship and true was a bone to be chewed
When the gales of November came early

The ship was the pride of the American side
Coming back from some mill in Wisconsin
As the big freighters go, it was bigger than most
With a crew and good captain well seasoned
Concluding some terms with a couple of steel firms
When they left fully loaded for Cleveland
And later that night when the ship's bell rang
Could it be the north wind they'd been feelin'?

The wind in the wires made a tattle-tale sound
And a wave broke over the railing
And every man knew, as the captain did too,
T'was the witch of November come stealin'
The dawn came late and the breakfast had to wait
When the gales of November came slashin'
When afternoon came it was freezin' rain
In the face of a hurricane west wind

When suppertime came, the old cook came on deck sayin'
Fellas, it's too rough to feed ya
At seven p.m., a main hatchway caved in, he said
Fellas, it's been good to know ya
The captain wired in he had water comin' in
And the good ship and crew was in peril
And later that night when 'is lights went outta sight
Came the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald

Does any one know where the love of God goes
When the waves turn the minutes to hours?
The searchers all say they'd have made Whitefish Bay
If they'd put fifteen more miles behind 'er
They might have split up or they might have capsized
They may have broke deep and took water
And all that remains is the faces and the names
Of the wives and the sons and the daughters

Lake Huron rolls, Superior sings
In the rooms of her ice-water mansion
Old Michigan steams like a young man's dreams
The islands and bays are for sportsmen
And farther below Lake Ontario
Takes in what Lake Erie can send her
And the iron boats go as the mariners all know
With the gales of November remembered

In a musty old hall in Detroit they prayed,
In the maritime sailors' cathedral
The church bell chimed till it rang twenty-nine times
For each man on the Edmund Fitzgerald
The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down
Of the big lake they called Gitche Gumee
Superior, they said, never gives up her dead
When the gales of November come early"
2945,"Hole 1 at Chestnut Ridge Park. Just outside Buffalo, NY. Got to come home for the week after living out of town for 7 years. If you zoom in you can see the city of Buffalo and Lake Erie.

2946,"Nestle, the super-cool company that claims ownership of 3 Great Lakes, all rain above the 33rd parallel, the oxygen in your bloodstream and your blood itself. They bought it in the Lake Erie deal (shoulda read the fine print, folks).



They just put a bid (and preemptive lawsuit...somehow?) in for our dreams. They'll get to advertise within our dreams and ensure that only Nestle products are consumed while dreaming. Nightmares both included and excluded from the Nestle terms of service and liability, of course."
2947,"One thing to note though, many of the communities along the Grand River treat their water, then expell it into the river.  The river leads to Lake Erie and eventually to the Ocean.  This is a slower way of moving the water out of the original aquifer area, and it benefits those down stream, so it isn't as harmful (I don't believe) as trucking the water away."
2948,"I think what also is contributing to the raise of cases along with everything else is small business owners being negligent with the procedures of COVID in fear of losing their businesses. My employer told me after I was exposed to an out break in put-in-bay on Lake Erie ‚Äú I know you don‚Äôt have your test results back yet but I‚Äôm comfortable with you coming back to work.‚Äù Can you not see long term effect this will have for you and the nation in the future if I come back positive? I don‚Äôt care if you think it‚Äôs real or not, or if you think it‚Äôs not that serious. Not being practical about the situation is going to cost you and everyone else. There is proof in other country‚Äôs that did what they were supposed to do and are having a much more success with keeping this under control.  Tokyo having one of if not the most densest population of a city in the world has a better grip on this than us. Simply because they were ahead of the curve wearing masks."
2949,Visiting from Wisconsin next week. Planning on seeing lake Erie. Could you recommend anything in the area?
2950,"I‚Äôve always wanted the team/management to get with local Lake Erie tribes and have a sit down with them. See if they can‚Äôt come up with something. Although anecdotal, I‚Äôve seen native Americans wear CLE Indians hats here and there at a NY reservation. So maybe there‚Äôs a chance we drop the Indians tag and let them give us options if any at all? I‚Äôd rather see an attempt at cultural inclusion done in a sensitive way than to just pretend Wahoo wasn‚Äôt racist since his inception."
2951,Fam and i just drove up to lake Erie for a day.. it looks just like that. I also realized making beach toys out of plastic is a bad idea.. we could easily make a sifter and bucket out of driftwood.. and not clutter the beach more..
2952,A Cleveland Nap sounds like when someone is floating face down in Lake Erie...
2953,"Lake Erie is very high right now so a few of my favorite beach spots are nearly underwater which was sad to see. Hope the water goes down a few feet to bring them back! But yeah, Cleveland has a couple beaches."
2954,"Skip these crowded islands and go to Middle Bass island instead. You are almost guaranteed to see many Lake Erie water moccasins in the summer, and no rowdy college kids getting drunk in the street. Just peaceful glacial grooves and nature."
2955,Given that Akron is in the lake Erie watershed they really should pipe in lake water and get rid of that reservoir.
2956,"I have a case against using the name commodores. I do like several things about the name commodores. The alliteration. The inclusion of oliver hazard perry and the battle of lake erie which the area already celebrates. Its solid, and we do like our nautical references.

But, my issue is more the context of going from a name that is about native americans and switching it to a name that is specifically referencing the war of 1812, which the battle of lake erie was a part of. The war of 1812 was a bit controversial at the time, some would argue it was a failure of a war when our intent was to capture what later became canada. At best we secured that our northern border would be the great lakes, and we forced the british out of those areas as we continued expanding westward.

My case is more built on that last part, that the war of 1812 was instrumental to our expansion westward and the continued displacement of native people. At that time this wasn't necessarily obvious, but in retrospect the war of 1812 was the last time that there was a chance for native people to resist american westward expansion in a unified way. If you have not already, i would recommend learning about Tecumseh and the Shawnee who once inhabited much of Ohio (though largely the central and southern portions of Ohio). Tecumseh attempted to unite the existing native tribes to fight against american expansion in the war of 1812, and ultimately died in that war, and with it the hopes of native people to resist displacement at the hands of Americans.

So, it just seems to me to be in poor taste. Like okay if we can't have the team name be indians we're going to instead continue to celebrate our displacement of native people. And I KNOW that most people don't know or care about this history or other perspectives about the war of 1812. And I KNOW that it sounds like I'm being petty af because clearly no one is thinking of using the name commodores as a way to further white supremacy or some shit like that. Its a name, it references a battle that took place on our lake, it references a dude with a badass name, like I get it. But during this time when we're trying to ""be better"", and since we have the opportunity to avoid this sort of thing, I'd really prefer to not have the team named commodores."
2957,"Right, like, I don't think I would have this issue with the name being Commodores if we weren't already starting from a place where we are moving away from Indians. Like its clearly not as ""bad"" as naming the team after andrew jackson (just as an example of someone who would be seen as overtly offensive to the living memory of native americans, he was the general during the war of 1812 though), but its too close for comfort in my own opinion. 

The legacy of the battle for lake erie is tied to the legacy of the war of 1812. Our success in that battle and in that war came at the expense of many native american lives in that war and beyond as we continued our westward expansion. I don't think we can, or should, focus solely on the battle of lake erie and ignore the greater context. 

And I do think, at the very least, when considering naming a team after a historical figure or event, its important to consider that greater context. Military events are...touchy. For good reasons. Each conflict will have a different context to it based on different perspectives. And I don't think its that much of a stretch to see the battle of lake erie in the context of fighting against native americans. And while i don't want to ""forget"" this history, I just don't think its the best way to move on from Indians as the team name."
2958,At least Lake Erie is spared.... right.....?
2959,"I saw one on Lake Erie a few years back, it was carnage, dead fish everywhere, a thick layer of green sludge stretching out about 100m from the shore. Not pleasant. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if we got one or more on Lake Ontario this year with all the hot dry weather."
2960,"Pumping water isn't free.  The water infrastructure is 50+ years old.  Akron and the surrounding area is over 400' higher in elevation than Lake Erie.  Also, people lost their shit when sewer rates went up to stop pumping raw sewage into the lake."
2961,"I lived in Cleveland for a year. It‚Äôs a nice city. Not my favorite, but there‚Äôs plenty to like about it:


Cheap cost of living.
Lots of good restaurants and bars.
Plenty of beautiful parks nearby.
Lake Erie is gorgeous and there‚Äôs plenty of access, including wonderful beaches!
Gritty character and personality.
Reasonable traffic for a major city.
Interesting museums, specifically the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Cleveland Art Museum.
Great live music scene.
Decent public transportation.

Here are some negatives too:

Bad weather, long winters.
Poor road quality, lots of construction.
Boring Downtown.
Poor sports teams (but they‚Äôre still fun to watch).
Not a lot of people from outside Cleveland, which means it can be hard to meet new people.
Some areas have really bad crime and blight.
Poor airport and flight selection.
Not a lot of great jobs.
Lots of pollution, both in the air and the water."
2962,"I live on Lake Erie. Water levels are approaching record highs this past couple years and it‚Äôs widely cited as evidence of climate change. It‚Äôs our fault and we need to do more. 

Interestingly enough, back in around ‚Äò06, Erie was at unusually low levels and that was also ‚Äúclimate change‚Äù, which actually makes more sense considering hotter temperatures should evaporate precipitation quicker. 

When you‚Äôre building computer models to prove your own hypothesis, you‚Äôre not doing real science, and when you‚Äôre pushing phoney science, everything can be ‚Äúevidence‚Äù of anything."
2963,"I grew up with a cottage on Lake Erie. Those long summer days swimming all day, sleeping all night to the sound of the crashing waves. I would give everything back to live a day at the cottage again."
2964,"""Green party Leader Mike Schreiner said changing environmental regulations is not necessary to get the economy moving.

Caring for nature, farmland and water is a vital part of the economic recovery, not something we sacrifice, he said in a statement.""

I was listening on am640 and the green party rep used the massive amount of residential buildings being constructed on Toronto as evidence that having a 6 year environmental assessment on manufacturing was alright and loosing $500 million in investments in Ontario to Ohio was alright.

The one thing I dont get about the Green movement is it seems they are only concerned about their own backyard. As if this polluting factory built on the other side of lake Erie will not send its pollution over the lake to Ontario or something. 

Personally I would prefer a reduced assessment time but have a government subsidy that will assist any new manufacturing facilities to use Greener meathods...

If the factory will be built either way why not have it here where we can get the jobs and ensure that at the least it will be less impactfull on the environment but if we have soo much red tape that corps just pick elsewhere to build then yeah ontario looks green but we are letting earth down in the long run."

2970,"We didn't learn much from that episode.  Lake Erie during the '60s and '70s became so heavily polluted with sewage and industrial waste that patches of the lake were declared dead. 

Fish kills and algae masses fouled the shoreline.  Tributaries like Cleveland's Cyahoga River and the Detroit River actually caught fire."

2972,"Nope, not anymore. I'm back to saying fuck DeWine there is zero clear path forward and he is constantly changing his mask policy. At first, for a few hours it was masks in public, then up to the businesses. Then it was encouraged. Now it's only counties seeing a spike. Nothing being done to stop people going to the party islands in Lake Erie where tons of spread is occurring.

2975,"Adding some local perspective... I moved to the northeast Ohio area 10 years ago. There are a couple of islands clustered together in Lake Erie. Put-in-Bay has never been my jam - it‚Äôs a very party oriented atmosphere. Nothing much to do outside of bar hopping and drunkenly golf carting around the island. I‚Äôve only been twice, and both times it was just walk to wall people completely hammered. Lots of bachelor parties and divorce parties. There‚Äôs another island, Kelly‚Äôs island, that is more family friendly. It has a state park where you can camp, and a few historical and tourist attractions. Still gets crowded, and people still drink, but people are generally a more respectable level of drunk, and just generally more aware and respectful of the people around them. A way more chill vibe. 

I was not at all surprised to read he went to Put-In-Bay and I‚Äôm not at all surprised it‚Äôs a hot bed for the virus."
2976,"Lived near lake erie for a bit. The news and local weather would put out wave heights for the day. Really windy days or stormy days would see wave heights 5 to 7 feet, rare occasions 8 feet high. No one swims in it because its mud and heavy metal."
2977,"Yep... I actually live in port Clinton. I hate it here now. Port Clinton is on a peninsula in the middle of lake erie so people flock here in the summer. Our whole area is FULL of assholes like this. Red neck campers who come up here and fill the campgrounds and hotels and restaurants and bars. No social distancing whatsoever. I‚Äôm a server here and thank god im still getting unemployment but when that runs out at the end of the month I have no idea what I‚Äôll do. Definitely not going back to serving with all this shit going on. 

There was also an incident on one of the islands here last week where someone who knew they were covid positive went to the islands and partied at the restaurants and bars. Now there‚Äôs a bug outbreak there and they are shutting everything down. The stupidity just pisses me off so much. 

Last I heard our tiny hospital now has 20 COVID 19 patients in it."

Our city put out trash barrels and we were told to use them. There were advertising campaigns and then fines if you were caught littering. I remember clearly, the days we would just throw garbage out the car window. 

I don't know what polluted the river - industry, farm runoff, sewage. It is much cleaner now.

2982,"We are sandwiched between the GTA, Buffalo, and possibly worst of all Niagara Falls, each of which cause enormous light pollution. Speaking from experience, you will likely find it challenging to capture a decent milky way that isn't horribly washed out and/or post-processed. If you do want a backdrop of something in the region, I would try to capture Niagara Falls itself or one of the lift bridges along the canal, but if you want to include the milky way you'll have to be doing some kind of composite photo with relatively advanced techniques and skill to get something appropriate. And if you're doing that, there's no real reason to also capture the milky way you're going to composite in from such a light polluted area.

Northern Ontario is a better bet, but if you can't get that far, try heading northwest of Hamilton into the central parts of southern Ontario, or southwest towards the less populated areas of Lake Erie's shoreline."

Lake Erie is fucking gross, it's always been dark green, smells and we've NEVER been able to see into the water. It's completely opaque. Why can't lake Erie look like this picture? I'd actually swim in this one, but Erie kills dogs with all the toxic chemicals in the water."
2988,"I have no doubt that it is. It's so heartbreaking. Northern Ohioans don't get a beautiful lake despite being right there on the edge of the great lakes. Every year, there is an algal bloom in lake Erie in the put-in-bay area. They say it's because of fertilizer runoff. However, in recent years they have had to post warnings all over telling people it's dangerous to swim. Look up pictures of how disgusting it looks from a bird's eye perspective. Sorry I'm on a doom and gloom tangent here, I'm just pissed other places on the same lake are gorgeous and this is what we get."
2989,"I can‚Äôt recommend eating Lake Erie fish personally; I‚Äôve caught some out of it and eaten them on occasion but we have a pretty polluted lake tbh. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs fine if you don‚Äôt do it that often, but unfortunately fish bioaccumulate toxins like heavy metals."

2991,"‚ÄúThe brilliant streaks of blue and green that color the Great Lakes in this image are a contradiction. The blue in Lake Michigan and Lake Huron is sediment brought to the surface when strong winds churned the lakes. The green in Lake Erie and in Lake Huron‚Äôs Saginaw Bay is algae, which builds on the surface when winds are calm.

Sediment most often colors the Great Lakes in the spring and fall when transitioning weather patterns bring storms and strong winds. The winds stir the water, pulling quartz sand and silt from the lake bottom to the surface, says Richard Stumpf, an oceanographer with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.‚Äù

Oak Openings, Magee Marsh, Howard Marsh, Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge, Maumee Bay State Park, etc are all great places to visit for wildlife viewing. You have warblers, trumpeter swans, bald eagles, northern harriers, sandhill cranes, king rails, yellow-headed blackbirds, etc. The area is full of threatened, endangered, and species of concern. 

From what I've also heard, the Toledo/Western Lake Erie Basin has the highest population density of bald eagles of any place in the contiguous 48 states. On a short trip, I once witnessed 7 bald eagles (not including repeats) in a single hour. It's insane."
2993,"Well considering that canonically Fluffies has cost enough damage ecologically and economically at a global scale with US being the most affected.(Caused enough damage agricultural and livestock supplies, created a lot of biological waste that can be breeding ground for diseases, destruction of Cleveland and Lake Erie.)

2994,"I feel that the poll misses white bass and rock bass. Down here near Lake Erie the white bass fishing in May and June is the best fishing IMHO. At times, 20+ fish in a couple of hours using jigs. Good to eat (once you remove the fat). Fight reasonably well, especially on light tackle.

I choose white bass."

2997,"I'd be interested in a breakdown of, for example, the US percentage of feedlot vs ranged animals, irrigation and the toll they take on waterways, and the like. While grazing animals are required to maintain a healthy ecosystem, it's generally in smaller numbers moderated by predators to about the damage herbivores can do to landscapes (Yellowstone), or to avoid famine cycles from overpopulation (isle royale). The monoculture and fertilizing of feed farms is also hugely damaging to waterways, a local example being runoff to lake Erie. Add to that growing animal protein consumption worldwide and the clear cutting of forests to provide pasture, I think it's a valuable research path to identify if we can recreate the good stuff. A quick scan shows about 32kwh energy equivalent to produce a pound of beef - that's a lot."

See that is a major return on investment for the energy company, I mean $60 million and get $1 billion in return?

3011,"Lifelong Ohioan aside from a year and a half in southern Indiana. The older I get and more I travel, the more I like and appreciate what Ohio does well while also wishing Ohio did a lot of things better.

Ohio will never have mountains, and that‚Äôs fine. We have some pretty cool areas to hike but tbh I don‚Äôt think they get marketed or maintained well enough to be as big of a draw as they should be. I wish people would associate Ohio with awesome woodlands, meadows and wetlands with nice meandering streams. But that would take a lot of funding and work to eradicate honeysuckle and other invasive species from old growth forests, regrow and redrajn wetlands, building boardwalks, marketing &amp; publicizing, etc. to get this done.

Ohio could have some pretty sweet beaches too but our legislators are too interested bending over backwards to accommodate the farming lobby. Regulations need to be put on allowable runoff from farm fields to reduce the amount of toxic waste running into the water. This waste causes algae blooms in places like Lake Erie and Grand Lake St Mary‚Äôs, making the water completely toxic. The Zebra mussel and Asian Carp crises need to be handled too.
Make the lakes nice and we become a great alternative vacation spot to Michigan or places like Lake Cumberland.

Same goes for our cities. Over the past 10 years finally the right things are being done. But we can‚Äôt stop. The 3Cs need expansive mass transit to stay competitive. Not just one streetcar, but full light rail that stretches out into the inner ring suburbs to encourage transit-oriented development. Development barriers need to be created to rein in sprawl. More focus needs to be put on redeveloping blighted areas while allowing the people in those areas to be lifted up in the process. Other cities in other states have done it (Denver, Portland, Minneapolis to name a few). We can do it too in Ohio.

What‚Äôs great about Ohio is our location, our roads, our industry, and our diversity in both people and topography. If you want to do it, Ohio will probably have it somewhere.

So Ohio to me is like the grand Victorian with finishes from the 1980s... rough on the edges, in need of a lot of work, but 100% fixable. And we need to do it as a state despite the fact we are basically ran by morons who don‚Äôt know the difference between their head and their butt."

3022,"That's awful. My purity ring was silver. I'm pretty sure that I threw it in Lake Erie when I deconverted. I feel kind of bad for littering, but I needed to symbolically get rid of it in a dramatic way to really make it stick in my mind. I don't know if that makes any sense."
3023,"&gt;who the hell

We're the people who have lived here for 50 or 75 years and worked in the Park.    We've watched it turn from a unknown gem (is that in Alaska?) to a selfie background because of social media (the glaciers are melting - go see them now! (the glaciers here are uninteresting compared to Alaska)).  We've seen main-street family businesses turn into big box stores and corporate outlets.  We've seen the homogenization of something we thought was local and unique.

People hop out of cars at scenic overlooks, snap a few selfies, and hop back in their cars.  No idea where they've been or what they saw.

Today at Avalanche i had a person holding two soda cans asking where the trash bin was.  It's at the trailhead, two miles away (next to your car).  We figured those two cans would end up behind a bush, next to all the used toilet paper.

Somebody was putting an inflatable SUP in the water, no tag.  All watercraft should be inspected for Aquatic Invasive Species (zebra mussels Quagga mussels, watermilfoi, etc.).  We don't want Avalanche Lake to end up like lake Erie.  We talked about that, and it's probably ok, please don't go over to the north shore because we have loons over there.  Guess where he went.

When i came to Montana fifty years ago i learned i had to be careful anywhere near a road - drivers would stop in case i wanted to cross. Now drivers blow through through blinking well-marked crosswalks.

We're seeing more bad behavior, more litter, more people thinking they're at Disneyland.  

So, yes, it's not our park.  We spent decades here acting as if it were. We know the rocks and flowers and trees and animals.  Everybody here acted as if it were our park, our back yard, someplace special.  Now we're getting visitors who are just ticking a checkbox on their bucket list and posting to Facebook and twitter

Yes, the park belongs to all of us.  It not our park, it's our home, and Wolfe was right."
3024,"Literally every surrounding state is blessed with more natural features.  

Michigan is surrounded on 3 sides with beautiful beaches.

PA, WV, and KY are much more mountainous with better hiking

Indiana has a small amount of coastline but the Indiana Dunes easily beat anything on the Lake Erie shore."
3025,Born and raised 15 minutes from lake Erie in Canada. I hate Nestle for what they're doing to our lakes.
3026,I know im from Lake Erie. Which is why I hate Nestle. And they are so hard to boycott.
3027,Ohio ruined lake Erie with pollution tbh
3028,Hello from the other end of Lake Erie! That rubbed me the wrong way too! Those little mussels made our beaches unwalkable.
3029,Lived on Lake Erie in the 80s. Was a polluted mess.
3030,"That‚Äôs important stuff, good work. I reference the graveyard that is Mitch McConnells desk filled with bills that could help folks like you and me when someone says the current Congress is nonfunctional. The Democratic Party essentially controls one half of one third of the federal government, so they can pass bills (like the first coronavirus relief) and then the Republican controlled senate can shove the bills right into the trash. Even when republicans controlled the house and senate they couldn‚Äôt pass anything...well anything that actually helped every day American people. They did, however, pass plenty of legislation that enriched the ‚Äúswamp‚Äù that was promised to be drained. They also have done everything possible to open federal lands for pillage by their friends for the natural resources located there. Lands that belong to you, and me. 

Imagine the Oak Openings region being commercially developed and destroyed, just so Exxon can make another trillion dollars. Living near Lake Erie and experiencing harmful algal blooms is only going to get worse. With the Trump administration‚Äôs rollback of the Clean Water Rule our local water bodies will be subjected to unregulated destruction. In this case, destruction of headwater streams and wetlands will increase sediment and nutrient discharge into Lake Erie which will increase the size and intensity of the toxin producing blooms. Someone in Toledo should care deeply for that, because you will be the community primarily paying for that rollback. This will also have negative impacts to the economies of those towns along Lake Erie that need those fishing dollars to exist. I want my children to be able to enjoy the natural resources that I have, and my worst fear is allowing them to be destroyed so that a CEO like Mnuchin, Tillrrson, or Devos can have a 5th yacht while people like you and I eat ramen to get by."
3031,He just rerouted all of USA's waste into Lake Erie
3032,"The balloons caused such a mess, the coast guard had to suspend a search for 2 missing fisherman, and also forced closure of the airport. The men's bodies ultimately washed ashore Lake Erie and the families sued the city."
3033,[The Cleveland Balloonfest](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloonfest_'86) they set a world record. It was pandemonium. Shut down the airports. Caused a ridiculous amount of litter. Two people actually ended up dying- they went overboard their ship in Lake Erie and the coastguard couldn‚Äôt find them because there were thousands of balloons in the water.
3034,Lake Erie is a swamp. That's why the ice is brown. The water is gross.
3035,Opioids kinda make us a joke IMO and Lake Erie is the worst lake / dirtiest
3036,"Hey I recognize that place, it's Cedar Point, Ohio. Lots of great coasters, and it's right on Lake Erie too. Hopefully they aren't faring too badly from the shutdowns."
3037,Yes! There are lots of places to hike and kayak in Ohio both in rural and urban areas. There is a trail from the Ohio River to Lake Erie and lots of other trail systems that were converted from rails to trails. It is a place worth exploring.
3038,"Someone set it on fire AGAIN?    


Seriously, I remember when the  Cuyahoga River and Lake Erie waterfront around Cleveland would occassionally catch fire and burn.    


In fact it caught fire at least 12 times.  [https://cen.acs.org/content/dam/cen/97/24/WEB/09724-cover-handcxd.jpg](https://cen.acs.org/content/dam/cen/97/24/WEB/09724-cover-handcxd.jpg)

It has come a long way but I would still not swim in either."
3039,"I was relieved a few weeks back when one the one branch of ger family cancelled their rooms down there, I figured the rest would follow. Obviously not, I don't really get the whole appeal of taking a trip in this shit anyway. We live on Lake Erie and it's August, if you're really jonesing for a beach day, save the cost of gas and hotels and take a 10 minute drive to one of our deserted beaches. If anything, travel to somewhere sunny in the winter when the situation is more under control and it's 15¬∞F outside here."
3040,I‚Äôm in northeast Ohio. Less than a mile from Lake Erie
3041,Ouch. Is this the same stuff that caused that Lake Erie algae bloom years back?
3042,"This sub increasingly confuses sarcastic derision with actual calls for, or fantasy of, violence. I‚Äôve said numerous times that Ohio belongs at the bottom of Lake Erie, but that doesn‚Äôt mean I actually fantasize about literally murdering a state."
3043,"I‚Äôm a freak about water and my favorite is the generic shit from Vitamin Shoppe. Refrigerated, it tastes like snow. Fucking Fiji and Evian and Aqua Panna and Pelligrino taste like Lake Erie"
3044,"Probably Lake Erie, the dirtiest of all the Great Lakes"
3045,"Interesting fact. Ohio used to be covered by about 5,000,000 acres of wetlands. Now, 200 years later, we're down to only about 480,000 acres left. Projects like H2Ohio are trying to reestablish some of that to prevent the nutrient loading we are seeing in places like Lake Erie. But it's definitely an uphill battle to bring some of that back."
3046,Yes! Not a lot of people seem to understand the importance of those wetlands and without them all thay fertilizer and other farmland runoff is destroying lake erie! We need to get more protected areas for marshlands near lake erie ASAP so we can protect our lake.
3047,"Yes actually, it used to but not since the late 60s. It was one of the most polluted rivers in the US but we‚Äôve improved the water quality a lot since then, although there is still plenty of garbage that makes its way out to Lake Erie. Cool fact, the 1969 fire actually helped spur the creation of the EPA and the Clean Water Act. 
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuyahoga_River"
3048,"In 1959, just after Alaska became a state, it was suggested that the Yukon River be dammed up. This dam would have a power capacity of nearly 6 GW and create a reservoir larger than Lake Erie. Proponents claimed the cheap power would attract industry to the sparsely populated state and that the reservoir offered recreational opportunities. But there were many opponents. They said it would offer few benefits while displacing 1,500 Native Alaskans and destroying a huge amount of natural habitat for wildlife. In 1967, Interior Secretary Stewart Udall cancelled the project. But the debate went on. In 1971, even the Army Corps of Engineers recommended against building it. And in 1978, President Carter created the Yukon Flats National Wildlife Habitat, precluding construction of the dam."
3049,Absolutely not. Grew up off Lake Erie and our water did not taste like this - its horrible!
3050,Rivers in southern Michigan are honestly disgusting. And they all flow into Lake Erie.
3051,I tried that once with an unlicensed piece of apparel and thousands of fish died in Lake Erie.
3052,"Also, if the other great lakes are any indication, lake Erie may be alot clearer 20 years from now even though it will be terrible for many aquatic species"
3053,"Hey man, when it‚Äôs not on fire, Lake Erie is *pumping*"
3054,Basically climate change only benefits us in the long run( I am from Ohio so Lake Erie) but not so much everyone living on the coast or a borderline livable place currently
3055,There are only 4 or 5 counties in Ohio that check emissions and they are all up by Cleveland/ Lake Erie so this might not even apply
3056,"Fair enough.

Also, I suppose the states off the Great Lakes are not technically ""International Waters,"" but share maritime borders with Canadian provinces.

Illinois and Indiana should probably come off the ""border states"" list because Lake Michigan is entirely within the US.

This would make Illinois the most populated ""interior"" state (#6 - 12.6 million).

And yes, Pennsylvania's access to Lake Erie is pretty small, but it is there (Same is true of Illinois and Indiana with Lake Michigan) .

The reason for the discussion was that the question about what people generally feel constitutes a border state was interesting.

There are many interpretations:

* States that border Mexico
* Florida and states that border Mexico
* States with land borders with other countries (with or without Alaska)
* Florida and states with land borders with other countries
* States with land borders with other countries or that border international waters (Hawaii is probably not considered at all)
* States with land or maritime borders with other countries or that border international waters

&amp;#x200B;

The subtle implication of the first two definitions is that it is only the southern border that matters with regards to disease and other ""bad things.""

Of course, it is the last definition that ICE prefers so that it can extend its range of operations as far as possible."
3057,"I've always said if I had enough money the #1 thing I would want to do is clean up the great lakes, particularly Lake Erie. I hope this is something that has last effects and not just a PR play."

3059,"&gt;**Foodies and Factory Farmers Have Formed an Unholy Alliance**    
&gt;  
&gt;*Their swipes at fake-meat products‚ÄîImpossible Burgers, Beyond Meat, and all the rest‚Äîare pretty much the same.*  
&gt;  
&gt;Progressives in the food movement have long been among the harshest critics of the livestock industry, mostly due to its reliance on Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs), commonly referred to as ‚Äúfactory farms.‚Äù These facilities are highly productive, but too often at the expense of animal welfare, and they place human medicine at risk through an excessive use of antibiotics. This is also the same livestock industry that supplies the red meats and processed meats Americans consume to excess, increasing the rates of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and some cancers.  
&gt;  
&gt;On the environmental side, runoff from livestock farms in the United States pollutes rivers and streams, degrading large bodies of water like Lake Erie and the Chesapeake Bay. The livestock industry is also a significant emitter of climate-warming greenhouse gases, contributing nearly [15 percent](https://uk.reuters.com/article/global-livestock-emissions/feature-fighting-global-warming-one-cow-belch-at-a-time-idUKL8N1U953J) of such emissions around the world.  
&gt;  
&gt;If imitation meat products from plant materials could begin replacing some of the real meat in our diets, all of these problems might be diminished. The fashion industry has learned to substitute imitation fur for the real thing; the shoe industry has learned to use imitation leather; imitation ivory has helped save elephants; and some imitation egg and dairy products are already a commercial success. Plant-based milks (made from almonds, oats, soy or coconuts, for example) now account for [14 percent](https://www.gfi.org/marketresearch#:~:text=Plant%2Dbased%20milk%20now%20accounts,an%20opportunity%20worth%20%2412%20billion.) of retail milk sales in the United States. If plant-based burgers could replace this much real ground beef in the coming decade, the needle could begin to move on a number of valuable goals.  
&gt;  
&gt;Despite this important opportunity, most food movement leaders have rejected plant-based meat imitations. Burgers assembled from plant materials, with chemicals added, do not conform to their preference for traditional ‚Äúwhole foods‚Äù with minimum processing and no added ingredients. Mark Bittman, previously a food columnist at the *New York Times* and a prominent food movement spokesperson, [faults imitation meats](https://newrepublic.com/article/119788/bloody-veggie-burger-not-vegetarians-including-mark-bittman) on these grounds: ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre combining a bunch of powders and turning it into something that looks like meat, I‚Äôm not sure you‚Äôre doing anybody any good. I don‚Äôt think it moves people in the direction of real food‚Äîwhich is the ultimate goal.‚Äù

3063,"That doesn't really say anything about using all of a shared resource, it just states that private ownership would negate pollution and force the owners to maintain their parts of the river.

From that article:

&gt;Government officials cannot sell the rivers or sell stock in them. Hence, they have no economic incentive to preserve the purity and value of the rivers. Rivers are, then, in the economic sense, ""unowned""; therefore government officials have permitted their corruption and pollution. Anyone has been able to dump polluting garbage and wastes in the waters. But consider what would happen if private firms were able to own the rivers and the lakes. If a private firm owned Lake Erie, for example, then anyone dumping garbage in the lake would be promptly sued in the courts for their aggression against private property and would be forced by the courts to pay damages and to cease and desist from any further aggression.¬†"

Climate change is important but so are things like education, healthcare, jobs, the economy, racial equality, LGBT rights... you can't expect people to give you a full write up on where she stands on every issue because (1) that would be very long and (2) you already know that she's a progressive Democrat, and that tells you where she stands on most issues in a very general sense.

That's not to say that all Dems are interchangeable, but you have to remember that this is Michigan, a swing state whose last Governor was a Republican who completely poisoned an entire city's water supply so badly that it has made national headlines for the last 4 years (Flint). A state with a huge interest in protecting its water supply, the Great Lakes, which is under constant threat from Republican lobbyists who want to pollute them. Electing Whitmer was a big win for conservationists everywhere.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's her platform on conservation (copy and pasted):

* **Addressing the extensive water infrastructure crisis that the Great Lakes region is facing** by tripling the federal investment into the Clean and Drinking Water State Revolving Loan Funds to address our region‚Äôs $179 billion backlog in drinking water, wastewater, and stormwater infrastructure so all of our residents have access to clean, safe, and affordable drinking water.¬†
* **Incrementally ramp up funding for Great Lakes Restoration Initiative** to $475 million per year to boost the region‚Äôs work of increasing coastal resiliency, cleaning up toxic contamination, reducing runoff pollution, stopping invasive species, and restoring wetlands and other habitats.¬†¬†
* **Support, fully fund, and expedite the plan to build new prevention measures at Brandon Road Lock and Dam** and support strong ballast water rules for every Great Lakes vessel to help stop and control the introduction and spread of invasive species in the region. Aquatic invasive species can alter the basic functions of the Great Lakes and all waterways, disrupting fisheries, wildlife, and water supplies.¬†¬†
* **Committing to assisting states in meeting their goals of reducing nutrient pollution in the Western Lake Erie basin by 40 percent by 2025** through federal funding, resources, and new technologies while continuing to monitor, report, and reduce nutrient pollution in the other Great Lakes and regional water bodies. Harmful algal outbreaks threaten our drinking water, economy, outdoor recreation, and fish and wildlife.¬†¬†
* **Supporting federal funding for ports, harbors, and critical marine infrastructure including the Soo Locks reconstruction project at Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan.** In addition to $52 million provided by the State of Michigan, $900 million is needed to modernize the Soo Locks and ensure they remain operational through reconstruction. A six-month unplanned closure at the Soo Locks would devastate the production of integrated steel, automobiles, and other heavy equipment throughout North America, decreasing U.S. gross domestic product by $1.3 trillion, costing the U.S. more than 11 million jobs.¬†
* **Push for increased federal action of both the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Defense to address PFAS contamination.** Across the Great Lakes region, states are tackling the challenge of addressing toxic contaminants like PFAS chemicals. States are looking to the federal government for financial resources and leadership in establishing drinking water standards.¬†

3067,"Great question I'll be releasing my platform on the website in the next week, but since you took the time to ask I'll take the time to answer. Over the pay 6 years as an activist &amp; community organizer I've spent a great deal of time on 3 citizens inititives that we had to get thousands of signatures to put on the ballot &amp; give the voters of Toledo the chance to decide for themselves because City Council wouldn't take up the legislation. I hope to continue the work I've already done on Council I eluded to it in my video it comes down to Safety Reconstruction, Environmental Justice, &amp; Anti Corruption legislation.

Safety Reconstruction 
Past work:  Sensible Toledo; decriminalization of Cannibus in Toledo. 
Present: Provide resources to underfunded communities &amp; people 
Goal: End bad policy &amp; wasteful spending that doesn't result in increased safety.  Do more to tackle to root of of crime as opposed to treating the symptoms 

Environmental Justice
Past work:  Lake Erie Bill of Rights; established the right for Lake Erie to be able to naturally grow &amp; flourish as part of our eco system by giving it rights.
Currently: Work to eliminate the barriers that prevent homeowners &amp; renters from the risk of lead paint poisoning.
Goal: govern with the idea that Toledo's most valuable resource is our environment. Environmental harm will disproportionately impact Toledoans health safety &amp; wellbeing &amp; future. 

Anti Corruption
Past work: Move to Amend Citizens United; established locally that corporations are not people &amp; each year we have a public hearing on democracy day on the impact of corporate money in politics.
Currently: Move to more publicly funded elections that remove barriers to new candidates getting involved &amp; create a pay to play atmosphere of corruption in government.
Goal: To change the culture of those with the most money having a greater influence on elected officials.

And this is just the US.

Across the world we let ""third world"" countries slowly develop and then didnt help them with infrastructure to prevent the same pollution we were slowly moving away from begin happening again because they might just become developed enough to compete with us on the world markets. 

We let corporations demonize progress because it hurt their bottom lines, let our oceans lake and aqufiers get polluted from our runoff because what we couldnt see we didnt care about.

Dogs are at a much greater risk of becoming sick from E.coli if anything I would imagine them being a source of the bacteria in that area even with BMPs measures in place. I've done a ton of research with NPS pollution and logically if test are showing above the TMDL levels it's not safe to swim until conditions improve(colder water, storms disrupting colonies, etc)"
3074,"I just found out about a proposal in the 1910s, called the Erie-Ontario Sanitary Canal, which would have reversed the flow of the Buffalo River (and probably Scajaquada Creek, too), and directed it out to Lake Ontario at Olcott Beach.  The canal would also have been an American alternative to the Welland Canal.  Justification for the project? Typhoid rates in Fort Erie, North Tonawanda and Niagara Falls was many times higher than Buffalo, thanks to pollution from the Buffalo River, and the City of Buffalo dumping untreated sewage into the Niagara River.

The canal, obviously, was never built.  A federal study found that the added diversion from Lake Erie, along with what was already being used for the Welland Canal, and power plants in the US and Canada, could be enough to slow the American Falls to a trickle.  It would also have been ridiculously expensive."

Of the big lake they called Gitche Gumee
The lake, it is said, never gives up her dead
When the skies of November turn gloomy
With a load of iron ore twenty-six thousand tons more
Than the Edmund Fitzgerald weighed empty
That good ship and true was a bone to be chewed
When the gales of November came early
The ship was the pride of the American side
Coming back from some mill in Wisconsin
As the big freighters go, it was bigger than most
With a crew and good captain well seasoned
Concluding some terms with a couple of steel firms
When they left fully loaded for Cleveland
And later that night when the ship's bell rang
Could it be the north wind they'd been feelin'?
The wind in the wires made a tattle-tale sound
And a wave broke over the railing
And every man knew, as the captain did too,
T'was the witch of November come stealin'
The dawn came late and the breakfast had to wait
When the gales of November came slashin'
When afternoon came it was freezin' rain
In the face of a hurricane west wind
When suppertime came, the old cook came on deck sayin'
Fellas, it's too rough to feed ya
At seven p.m., a main hatchway caved in, he said
Fellas, it's been good to know ya

3101,Dan Marino would not have put up the numbers in Buffalo he had in Miami. The declining weather the further you get into the season impacts a QBs play as do the notorious winds coming off Lake Erie that rip through the Stadium.
3102,"this made me look up the depths of the great lakes, of course superior's the deepest. https://www.epa.gov/greatlakes/physical-features-great-lakes

what's most interesting is the water retention time- a drop of water can be expected to stay in lake superior for 191 years, but only 2.6 years in lake erie."
3103,"The drum corps I was in stopped at a park next to Lake Erie for a tour break (1976). We were told there was only one area ""clean"" enough to swim in, so most of the kids jumped right in. I never understood how an open lake would be clean in one small area, so I didn't join them. The one thing I remember that freaked me out the most though was the HUNDREDS of Grand Daddy Long Leg spiders in the bathroom. So thick in the corners, you couldn't see the walls!"
3104,"I get the idea of this, but where they actually come from when you buy fish isnt much better a lot of the time. 

My first example is lake Erie. Ive never been to that lake without seeing dead fish floating at the shore, but tons of people eat fish out of that lake. Id argue its worse than the mon."
3105,"I don't know but they do. 

We had some flooding going on due to high water levels in Lake Erie so one of the roads right next to it was down to 2 lanes and the traffic was moving slower. It was visually obvious that there was water all over the one side of the road and the waves were pretty high that day so it wasn't like it was hidden. 

A guy in a raised full size pick up truck got impatient and ripped around everyone, blowing past the ""Danger: High Water"" sign and pulling into the closed lane to get around . 

He got a nasty surprise when the water was deeper than he thought and part of the road had been washed away.  In case you are wondering, large pick ups are not particularly buoyant :) It stopped traffic because we were all trying to reach him and toss out ropes/rings to him. The Coast Guard wasn't pleased about having to get him out of there when they found out he had gotten in there by driving where he shouldn't. I imagine he had to pay a great deal of money to retrieve his truck from the lake floor, too. 

Around here, it's always the large truck owners who think that they are invincible."
3106,isnt lake erie always gross? whenever we tried to go to the beach there were always e coli outbreak warnings
3107,You can tell this is lake erie and not lake superior because children aren't being frozen in place as soon as they touch it.
3108,"In salt water, even Mg is too reactive. Zn is used for seawater; Mg is used in fresh water (Great Lakes, for example.)

3109,Lake Erie has been cleaned up and the Salish Sea has an issue with lone feet floating ashore.
3110,"Lake Erie Weather:

3111,Lake Erie actually caught on fire once from all the crap floating around in it....
3112,Where are you at on Lake Erie? I‚Äôve never surfed but always wanted to learn. About an hour from the lake. It‚Äôs just so damn dirty compared to all the other Great Lakes
3113,Do we claim their portion of Lake Erie to stop them from f-ing it up again? I bet Canada would be on our side for that.
3114,Yes! I thought they looked like Zebra mussels! I grew up next to Lake Erie and I remember my dad teaching me about them in the 90's.
3115,"I was at a town hall type event six or seven years ago when he spoke about loosening regulations on watersheds. I asked him if he knew that, in 1970, Lake Erie was declared a ""dead"" lake due to lax regulations. He stated that he was sure industry and agriculture wouldn't allow that to happen again. Totally and completely an idiot and a liar."
3116,As long as lake Erie doest dry up we will still get snow/some precipitation where I'm at which is great! Though there is definitely a noticeable drop in snowfall amounts and rise in temps. Can't understand how people still refuse to see this.
3117,"*Stepped outside for the first time in three days. I can't believe its november.*

Midwest checking in. It‚Äôs 75 out today, I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs November either...neither can the birds, about a quarter of the trees (with summer green leaves still), Lake Erie, and so on..."
3118,"I'm not clear on what size boats can make it out that way, but the primary access to the Great Lakes is big enough for ocean freighters (Lake MI -&gt; Lake Huron -&gt; Lake Erie -&gt; Welland Canal -&gt; Lake Ontario -&gt; St. Lawrence River -&gt; Atlantic Ocean). Definitely not landlocked! The shipping through there is also the reason the Great Lakes get invasive species like zebra mussels.

This article about the Great Loop (https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/great-loop.html) mentions consideration of less than a 5' draft, I'll guess that's for secondary routes. Wish I knew more about the limits of the Lake MI -&gt; Mississippi route. 

IIRC the SeaQuest spends a lot of time in Florida and the Caribbean (it's registered in the Cayman Islands). It's currently shown as in the Ft. Lauderdale area but it's been a while since the last location update: https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:385516"
3119,"It does in the Detroit area. My neighborhood pipe runs 1/4 mile to an open drain/creek, that runs about 3 miles through a couple other neighborhoods and connects to a larger creek. That runs 5 miles or so until it connects to the Rouge River which ultimately dumps into the Detroit River/Lake Erie. There are a few areas connected to treatment plants but the majority of residential drains here are set up the same way."
3120,"Other way around -- Niagara Falls is eroding its way upstream. Another few thousand years and it'll reach lake Erie, draining it and turning it into the Erie River, rendering Cleveland's ports useless.

As my brother once said, if we're not moving cargo in fusion-powered spaceships by then, we deserve the fate of having to build more Cleveland."
3121,"Sadly for you the water in Lake Erie is so polluted that it's considered bleach, and all the fish have aids too. So unless you find away to cure aids and drain and entire lake then I'm good"

3125,"To be fair though, a lot of areas even within southern Ontario don't have access to modern cable internet. My hometown on lake Erie only recently got cable internet (replacing DSL) and even then its only a small time local ISP that price gouges like crazy"
3126,Idk maybe he's like a Zebra mussel. It's an invasive species that lives in Lake Erie.
3127,...let's hope we never face a harmful algal bloom.  It's [happened recently on Lake Erie](https://www.toledoblade.com/local/2014/08/03/Water-crisis-grips-area/stories/20140803090).
3128,I lived near lake Erie. I don‚Äôt think people realize how freakishly large and deep these lakes are. They look like oceans
3129,"We were on track with that until trump came into office. Defunding a lot of green projects, deregulating emissions and waste runoff, etc. I'm in ohio and he pulled the plug on our initiative to clean up lake Erie and our rivers. But without the amazon rainforest, the world is fucked. They produce about 9% of land oxygen for the planet, according to national geographic."
3130,"""Isn't it going right back into the aquifer though?"" Not really. If you draw water from a 50 m deep well (a lot of the Region's wells are this deep) and then dump it back into the ground at the surface in a totally different location, you've completely altered that water's fate - in all likelihood that water was hundred+ year old rainwater (within a regional aquifer that naturally slowly, slowly, slowly moves water to regional discharge features like major creeks and the Grand River - like over thousands of years) when it was pumped, and dumping it back into the ground at surface, now it's part of the shallow flow system most likely to discharge to a local drainage ditch or small creek, from there it'll go to the grand and then Lake Erie, gone from the watershed far faster than it would have otherwise.

"" And don't all cities have substantial (more than 10%) freshwater loss in the delivery network? "" Yes absolutely. I develop groundwater models for a living  (the Region's groundwater model being one of them) and I can tell you ""enhanced recharge"" is very often applied to models in urban areas to account for this. Water distribution network engineers come at this from the other angle and tell me just how much they think they're losing through leaky pipes and it helps me inform the groundwater model's boundary conditions.

Calling it a ""massive"" waste isn't really accurate considering the quantities involved (the region pulls 115 million litres out of the ground every friggin' day so you can have a clean car and a green lawn), but don't take it for granted - death by a thousand cuts is a real thing and we all need to engaged and informed about it to preserve our most vital public resource.

3131,"Libertarian leaning except with fossil fuel subsidies and tax breaks. 

Libertarian in wanting no government regulations on polluting.

It's bad management that they did t pivot with the times.


So, being unable to manage their way out of the 20th century, they try to buy their way out of it by stacking the supreme court with judgesfrom the Federalist society.  Who would say ""small government"" which is code for ""let us set lake Erie on fire again like the olden days. """
3132,"Nuclear power plant on Lake Erie- No big deal

3133,I live relatively close to Lake Erie and have seen quite a few of these on the beaches
3134,A great way to help the Great Lakes especially Lake Erie is to make your farmers properly handle their waste run off. It‚Äôs caused algae outbreaks that have caused drinking water to be toxic. The toledo area and much of northern Ohio suffers because of the lax pollution laws in Michigan
3135,"I know people from Michigan are not used to reading but there is this. 

https://www.environmentalcouncil.org/agriculture_runoff

‚ÄúCommercial farms‚Äô use of fertilizer is responsible for a majority of the nutrients that feed Lake Erie‚Äôs toxic algae blooms. Fertilizer is rich in phosphorus, a key ingredient in plant growth, but when too much phosphorus enters a waterbody, nutrient loading occurs and can trigger an explosive growth in algae. When the algae dies, it absorbs oxygen in the water, creating dead zones and the eventual die-off of aquatic plants and animals.‚Äù"
3136,"Depth and by extension, temperature.  Erie is much shallower and warmer than Lake Michigan, especially where SE Michigan touches Lake Erie.  You can literally go out hundreds of feet from shore and still only be waist deep in bath water temps.  Those warmer temperatures combined with the runoff are key to the algae blooms that western Lake Erie gets throughout summer.

You can literally see this on pretty much any satellite view of Lake Erie in the summer time.  The entire western portion of the Lake is entirely green, while the deeper areas on the eastern side by PA and NY are not."
3137,"Maybe it catching on fire is 40 years ago, but Toledo couldn‚Äôt drink it‚Äôs tap water as recent as 2014 because of it, and many parts of Lake Erie has a no contact warning because of cyanobacteria."
3138,"That water drains into Lake Erie. The algea blooms are bad in Western Lake Erie due to the temp and how shallow it is. I'm convinced the Maumee River is the source of most of the problem, but the small shoreline certainly doesn't absolve Michigan, when literally all the rest of its shoreline is water that eventually drains to Lake Erie anyway."
3139,"I don‚Äôt really care about upvotes, but I‚Äôm not sure what you don‚Äôt find factual. [here is a recent picture of lake erie](https://blog.nationalgeographic.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MODIS_erie_Oct9_2011.jpg) 

There are [articles from this year talking about how toxic Lake Erie is](https://www.pri.org/stories/2020-01-23/lake-erie-turns-toxic-every-summer-officials-aren-t-cracking-down-source)

There are advisories on the news throughout the summer when and when not to swim in Lake Erie. 

My point is, it is better than 40 years ago. However it is still bad, it is still toxic, and it can kill you. Those are facts. The algae boom problem in Lake Erie is the cuyahoga fires of our generation."
3140,"I noticed weather advisories on Twitter earlier today warning that Lake Erie is going to be a mess. [Long Point](https://www.simcoereformer.ca/news/local-news/flood-watch-issued-for-lake-erie-shoreline) looks like it's going to get absolutely hammered. Stay safe, everyone."
3141,Because a spill at Detroit would flow into Lake Erie which Michigan has been polluting for 150 years. But your probably right it‚Äôs not shorter. It‚Äôs more about Canadians not wanting the pipeline through their backyard.
3142,"If you are in Cleveland and looking across Lake Erie that is probably the greenhouses in Leamington, Ontario, Canada. We can see them from our house inland and they make the sky glow orange or purple (for the cannabis grow lights). There has been a ton of articles written about them lately due to the light pollution"

3154,"Yea I‚Äôd put Cleveland over Columbus, I‚Äôve been there once and it was pretty nice. Aside from it being absolutely freezing (in the case of Lake Erie, literally) since it was February but that‚Äôs all of Ohio."
3155,Same thing with lake Erie. The pollution from Detroit makes beautiful sunsets
3156,"Wow, that sounds amazing. I had no idea you could turn algae into wax, I always thought paraffin wax was a petroleum byproduct. I remember several years ago the water quality in Lake Erie was improving, and a portion of that was apparently due to the quantity of Zebra Mussels, which we've always been taught were pests, but apparently they eat and filter out the algae and were doing wonders for our water quality. Also pollution regulation. I'm not sure what happened since then, but it's gotten bad again. Our lakes and rivers are catching on fire again for the first time in like 20 years. Its terrifying and heartbreaking. I mean, I'm no expert of course, but something that both improves water quality while also producing materials that can be sold? And its solar powered? That sounds like a damn miracle. I wish you luck, it might not change the world, or maybe this is the breakthrough tech people were looking for."
3157,"I didnt move away from those other regions so I can't say anything about them. But the  Cuyahoga river literally caught on fire multiple times because of pollution, and swimming in lake Erie is pretty disgusting. The parks really used to be nice, not worth staying for them, but still it counts for something."
3158,"&gt;There‚Äôs also infrastructure to consider...consolidated sewer overflows are common in older cities. 

Pittsburgh syndrome!

Cleveland and Detroit (also PGH) both have mild summers that should make them desirable under climate change. But they also have stinky polluted water‚ÄîDetroit is doing slightly better here because geography is more favorable. It's hard to make a eutrophicated Lake Erie into a selling point."
3159,"Cleveland is doing stuff to mitigate its runoff and limit discharging raw sewage into Lake Erie. I hope it will help clean the beaches...but we still have farmers and their fertilizer runoff messing up the lake and creating algal blooms, sadly...."

3165,They were trying to beat a Guinness world record. They didn‚Äôt get it. Probably because Guinness didn‚Äôt want people doing this any more. Most of the balloons fell into Lake Erie and traveled to Canada.
3166,There used to be...I think 4 steel mills on the Cuyahoga River. Now there‚Äôs only one left. They didn‚Äôt build them on Lake Erie because the water gets incredibly rough very quickly if a storm comes through...and there really isn‚Äôt anywhere to put one closer to the mouth of the river. The mills probably started small and the ships got bigger as the mills got bigger and the river channel got dredged deeper.
3167,"Have any research that backs up this claim? All the research I've seen contradicts your claim. Unless you're saying that the 1¬∞ rise in global temperature, isn't enough to convert snow to water? I guess that is technically true in some cases. It might not directly impact it, but there's so many other factors to consider. The slight increase in temp changes when and how long Lake Erie freezes over. This drastically impacts local climates. The rise in temps also creates massive algae blooms, which leads to worsening storms. Higher temps have been linked to less snow fall, but increased precipitation, leading to flooding, soil erosion and nutrient loss. Global warming is so much more in-depth then most people realize. Some areas will notice the impacts significantly more than others. 

You can look all this stuff up, it isn't my opinion. I've personally noticed a massive decrease in snow over the past few years, as well as unorthodox changes in weather. I'm not a scientist though and I wouldn't ever use my views/opinions to make claims. My claims are based on research and experts in the field."
3168,"&gt; Typically, a helium-filled latex balloon that is released outdoors will stay aloft long enough to be fully deflated before it descends to Earth. However, the Balloonfest balloons collided with a front of cool air and rain and dropped towards the ground, still inflated, clogging the land and waterways of Northeast Ohio. In the days following the event, balloons were reported washed ashore on the Canadian side of Lake Erie.

&gt; Two fishermen, Raymond Broderick and Bernard Sulzer, who had gone out on September 26, were reported missing by their families on the day of the event. Rescuers spotted their overturned 16-foot (4.9 m) boat anchored west of the Edgewater Park breakwall. A Coast Guard search and rescue helicopter crew had difficulties reaching the area because of the ""asteroid field"" of balloons. A search-and-rescue boat crew tried to spot the fishermen floating in the lake, but Guard officials said balloons in the water made it impossible to see whether anyone was in the lake. On September 29, the Coast Guard suspended its search. The fishermen's bodies subsequently washed ashore. The wife of one of the fishermen sued the United Way of Cleveland and the company that organized the balloon release for $3.2 million and later settled on undisclosed terms.

&gt; Balloons landing on a pasture in Medina County, Ohio, spooked Louise Nowakowski's Arabian horses, which allegedly suffered permanent injuries as a result. Nowakowski sued the United Way of Cleveland for $100,000 in damages and settled for undisclosed terms.

&gt; Burke Lakefront Airport had to shut down a runway for half an hour after balloons landed there. Traffic collisions were also reported ""as drivers swerved to avoid slow motion blizzards of multicolored orbs or took their eyes off the road to gawk at the overhead spectacle"". 

&gt; The 1988 copy of The Guinness Book of World Records recognizes the event as a world record ""largest ever mass balloon release"", with 1,429,643 balloons launched.

The wind in the wires made a tattle-tale sound
And a wave broke over the railing
And every man knew, as the captain did too
T'was the witch of November come stealin'
The dawn came late and the breakfast had to wait
When the gales of November came slashin'
When afternoon came it was freezin' rain
In the face of a hurricane west wind
When suppertime came, the old cook came on deck sayin'
""Fellas, it's too rough to feed ya""
At seven PM, a main hatchway caved in, he said
""Fellas, it's been good to know ya""
The captain wired in he had water comin' in
And the good ship and crew was in peril
And later that night when his lights went outta sight
Came the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald
Does any one know where the love of God goes
When the waves turn the minutes to hours?
The searchers all say they'd have made Whitefish Bay
If they'd put fifteen more miles behind her
They might have split up or they might have capsized
They may have broke deep and took water
And all that remains is the faces and the names
Of the wives and the sons and the daughters
Lake Huron rolls, Superior sings
In the rooms of her ice-water mansion
Old Michigan steams like a young man's dreams
The islands and bays are for sportsmen
And farther below Lake Ontario
Takes in what Lake Erie can send her
And the iron boats go as the mariners all know
With the gales of November remembered
In a musty old hall in Detroit they prayed
In the maritime sailors' cathedral
The church bell chimed 'til it rang twenty-nine times
For each man on the Edmund Fitzgerald
The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down
Of the big lake they called Gitche Gumee
Superior, they said, never gives up her dead
When the gales of November come early"

3186,"Lake Erie is a shallow, polluted shithole now.

Thanks unchecked dumping of toxic chemicals and general disregard for anything but dollars!"
3187,"Ohio's wind resources are undercut by bad-faith, overly restrictive setbacks for wind turbines near other developed land, severely limiting the potential supply (Ohio is very densely developed, even in rural areas). Leads to the false impression that Ohio isn't good for wind, but also difficulty in proving otherwise unless you know the nitty gritty details of the regulations. Hopefully offshore wind projects on Lake Erie can change this.

Solar is complicated by how dramatically seasonal it is for Ohio. Average might be similar to other places that have developed renewables, but without a better grid to import electricity, solar only pays off for 8 months, and the missing ones are the high-demand winter months. Means you need redundancy which makes things much more expensive.

Moral of the story is that state-by-state solutions are handicapped in the US for many states, and a more interconnected grid to transmit power between states would go further than anything a single state could do."
3188,There is also talk about Lake Erie getting legal rights as a person
3189,"Think of someone born in 1890. They are 10 at the turn of the century, and it seemed like life would get better and better. Everyone believed in scientific progress forever with no downsides. 

Then came WW1, and millions of lives lost and ruined over an imperial squabble. Our hypothetical citizen would have been of military age and might have participated. Then the Great Depression, then WW2. WW2 ends with an atomic blast. Humanity seems hellbent on destroying itself.

Our citizen is 65 when the first hydrogen bomb is detonated. 

At the age of 70, our individual would be convinced that the world would have mass starvation by 1980, and surely by 1990. Most thinkers were convinced of this. 

At 75, our citizen sees pollution reach crisis levels. Rivers set on fire. Biologists fail to find macroscopic life in Lake Erie, which is declared a dead lake. Smog in all major cities hangs thick almost every day. Silent Spring, the book, predicts imminent ecological collapse.

Let's say this individual lives to 90 and sees 1980. The Cold War shows no sign of ever ending. The Malthusians are a little more quiet, because the millions of starvation deaths haven't comes to pass - but they will! Everyone will be out of food by the year 2000. Just wait.

There are 50 000 nuclear warheads on earth. The USSR and USA can each destroy the world many times over. One day the inevitable will come.

Crime is high. Interest rates are skyrocketing. Miami is economically dependent on the drug trade. 

In his or dying breath, our imagined individual feels pity for the poor child born that day. That child will experience a dangerous and terrifying world, and is likely to starve to death or be annihilated in a nuclear blast, or be poisoned by the pollution crisis. Poor kid with no future."
3190,"&gt;Drop boxes are for people that waited too long, missed even mail their ballot back the day before the election, and need to vote absentee rather than in person while wearing a mask. 

We should still make it easier to vote for these people. And think about the folks who live on the islands on Lake Erie and have to take a ferry to the drop box. If there's a storm or they don't have money they now just lost their ability to vote. 

There isn't any reason to block counties from placing additional dropboxes where needed other than intentionally trying to disenfranchise people."
3191,"I like Great Lakes Brewing Co IPAs. Burning River, Lake Erie Monster. All dem."
3192,"Wouldn't work for me. My mom grew up in Buffalo in the 60s and 70s. Lake Erie was so polluted that they had signs advising people against swimming. My Dad grew  up in California's Central Valley, which today has some nasty air quality and was definitely worse back then (plus they were still using DDT)."
3193,"Yowza, don‚Äôt mess around with Lake Erie"
3194,"I did mine on the Lake Erie algae blooms. I think the easiest way to approach it is to find a place (Lake Erie, Australia, the Amazon rainforest...) or a topic (species loss, water quality, deforestation...) that you think is interesting or that you have some connection to and then work from that. Or google different topics until you find an interesting news article and use that as your starting point for lit review"
3195,"Probably did, the Cuyahoga dumps right into Lake Erie. Here's an article I found, I guess it's caught on fire a couple times.

3196,This is why I live one block from a lake connecting Lake Erie and Lake Huron. If climate change costs as much as it should then property for Detroit will be jumping up in value as a port and bridge to Canada with water access.
3197,"Here by Lake Erie in Ohio (U.S.) there are several places along the lake that raw sewage overflows into it when we have severe rain. 
 If I had to guess, 2 or 3 times a year. Although that is not getting into the tap water system immediately, we do use the lake to draw our water from, the plant is miles out and it's obviously treated before entering the system.  I don't know if there is anything in the works to fix the problem, which seems very puzzling."
3198,My biggest concern after swimming in Lake Erie was whether or not I would later grow a third arm out my forehead from all the toxic chemicals (was all that far from where the Cuyahoga river emptied into the lake)
3199,It doesn't take much to be out of water. Look at the 2019 main break in Chattanooga TN at the main site and the Lake Erie algae bloom a few years ago. Happens all the time.
3200,"I can only speak for Cleveland, but the radioactive waste in lake Erie gives us abilities some consider.... unnatural"

3202,Yeah I‚Äôve got Lake Erie water it‚Äôs pretty bad. It‚Äôs good for livebearers though
3203,"You‚Äôve clearly ignored the toxic mess of Lake Erie, the shallowest of the Great Lakes.  In summer so much toxic algae builds up that most of the Ohio beaches are closed and a dog even taking one drink of the water can be killed.

3204,"I can't speak to the job questions, but Cleveland Clinic has been one of my clients for the past 5 years and I've spent a lot of time up there (pre-COVID-19). The people that I've worked with there are great, but man that city is rough. Winter gets bad there, in the spring when everything starts thawing out it smells awful, the rivers and Lake Erie have been horribly polluted for well over 100 years and it just looks like an industrial wasteland. When I was traveling up there weekly for a few months, the only thing that kept me sane was knowing that I'd be able to come back to Durham on Thursday night and be able to get away from that place for a few days. I feel sorry for my coworkers that have to live there, but hey, that's on them.

Otherwise, I can say that my partner has worked as an RN and NP in various roles at Duke for the past 15+ years and she plans on retiring from there. They've treated her well over the years, paid for her to get an MSN and promoted her as her career has progressed."
3205,"Most of the hog farms here are in places where it's wet most of the year, so the rivers don't tend to be really awful most of the time, because it usually it doesn't stay that polluted for all that long.  The worst place is Lake Erie, because the water sits around there long enough to grow massive amounts of poisonous algae."

3208,"It is. They blocked it for a while to create the hydro electric power plants.

Funfact, the falls won't be a permanent waterfall, they have moved upstream ~7 miles over 12000 years. In about another 15000 years it will reach lake erie, but before that it will split on either side of buckhorn island creating 2 completely seperate waterfalls. Eventually one will reach the southern tip of the island first which will drain the other side making longhorn island no longer an island. There will even be a short time when it reaches navy island there will be 3 waterfalls."

Scary times, boys! Scary times...."
3210,"Great Lakes water is awful.

If you want to see what goes into the drinking water in Southern Ontario, search for the Cuyahoga River fire. Whatever comes out of that river ends up in Lake Erie and eventually Lake Ontario.

And I haven‚Äôt even included Sarnia‚Äôs Chemical Valley."
3211,"Yes it is. It‚Äôs an Ohio EPA statistic. I‚Äôll see if I can find ya some documentation. Sure farmers are dumping insane amounts of nutrients onto bare soil and watching it wash away with every rainfall, but sediment is being washed into every single stream at elevated rates, even just with climate change. Add in human impacts to the soil surface and us facilitating water going straight into rivers and the extreme amounts of agricultural fields that were once forest. All those fields pump billions of tons of sediment into Lake Erie and the Ohio River (most polluted stream this side of the Mississippi River) annually."
3212,"I can't be the only one here who remembers a mile-long (or maybe longer?) Stretch of milkweed along Lake Erie's Cleveland coast, near where Whiskey Island is now, and stopping in the late summer/early fall just to see the monarchs. I'm not that old, only 27, and I also remember beaches free from zebra muscle shells. It's all parking lots now, and zebra muscle shells, too. The damned sharp-as-glass invaders."
3213,"Great lakes does have a beer called burning river for a reason. 

That said, Cleveland did clean up the Cuyahoga river and lake Erie to where there are fish again. So I guess the total collapse of manufacturing wasn't all bad..."
3214,Good looking pic. I grew up on the Western edge of Lake Erie. It was disgusting back then.
3215,"Awesome, let's hope it comes to fruition.

So many cities mismanaged or poorly planned waterfront properties in the early and mid 1900s not realizing how valuable of an asset they can be as green spaces and/or light commercial areas.  Just look at Cleveland for example.  They put the interstate right along Lake Erie and now have to deal with the fallout of their most prime real estate being cut off from the rest of the city when it's ripe for reinvestment."
3216,Yeah I grew up right on Lake Erie and I can still hear my parents every time I went down to the lake warning me about it.
3217,"Actually at least for NY it's not that good. I believe Buffalo gets its water from the Erie. LI has natural aquifers and thus has really clean tap compared to lake water. 

Well at least if if you don't mind the cancer causing chemicals from Northrop Grumman's years of dumping toxic waste all the way from the Apollo Era to the last f14's off the line. Although I am sure Lake Erie has seen worse abuse."
3218,And not just taste bad - they accumulate dioxins and PCBs. If you eat a carp from Lake Erie it will fuck you up.
3219,Lake Erie also is straight up not safe to swim in its so polluted. It's gotten a lot better than 100 years ago at least...

No it‚Äôs a really good thing that it didn‚Äôt work out üôÉLOL I would be in deep shite if we would‚Äôve gotten married.. he screwed my head up so badly that I couldn‚Äôt go out with anybody for about three years, turned me into a completely different person..  I had to find myself again and it took forever some people are really really good at brainwashing other people..

my point exactly, if it isn‚Äôt illegal and people grow up being used to that fact they tend to not abuse it like I said forbidden fruit lol

I‚Äôve been on my fair share of airplanes throughout my life, my mother loves traveling so we went a lot of places when I was a kid and I‚Äôve taken a few trips myself as an adults also but I never got over the fact that I still love the smell of airplane/hotel, I think it‚Äôs just the fact that the smell relates to my brain to the fact that I‚Äôm getting away from buffalo and my routine for a little while lol and I cannot stay awake unfortunately as soon as they pressurize the cabin I‚Äôm out like a lightüòÇ and that sucks because that‚Äôs my favorite part of flying is watching the lift off! And I would not step foot on an airplane right now just my personal opinion, you‚Äôre stuck in a pressurized cabin with what about 50 people or so? That‚Äôs just asking for it!! LOL i‚Äôve never been in a light aircraft but it‚Äôs definitely on my list I‚Äôve always wanted to fly in a Cessna that only seats 2-3 people right? I can imagine that it was probably a completely crazy different experience! I‚Äôve also always wanted to parachute someday, lol someone might have to push me but I‚Äôm gonna do it someday!

Pop to the shops? Do you ask the people behind the counter for a pop in the shop? lol that‚Äôs a different oneüòÜ maybe next time I go to the gas station I‚Äôll ask for a pop in the shop lol see what kind of response I get! You gotta wonder where it originated from, if it came across the water from us or from you lol

To get a pretty heavy accent you do have to go kind of far, driving to Colorado takes like 17 hours and I don‚Äôt even think they have a very deep accent, I think u would have to the south.. To get a real good southern accent you‚Äôd have to go to Alabama or Louisiana and that‚Äôs about 900 some odd miles from here so yeah we have to go pretty far lol there are slight accents closer but nothing as intense! You‚Äôre probably used to hearing accents so often that it doesn‚Äôt even phase you. People say that we have an accent but I don‚Äôt hear it myself but then again you probably don‚Äôt hear your accent either lol i‚Äôve seen some movies set in parts of England where the accent is so thick, yes they‚Äôre speaking English but it‚Äôs not English LOL you can‚Äôt understand a word they sayüòÜ like in the movie snatch (in my top 5!!) I love that movie so much lol Bricktop is the best bad guy especially when he‚Äôs talking about his pack of pigs &amp; how to get rid of a body üòÜüòÜ One of the best phrases? Ever in a movie lol

Lake Erie is pretty big so he could have lived in Cleveland, Ohio, Pennsylvania.. Lol that‚Äôs pretty cool though that he would hang out with the Canadian border patrol fishing lol

It was insane how Women were considered so much of a ‚Äúweaker sex‚Äù back then! I didn‚Äôt know that they measured it women‚Äôs bathing suits like that that‚Äôs just crazy!! But there is a certain charm to how people dressed and presented themselves back then, i‚Äôm sort of into 50‚Äôs cosplay lol I have a couple of pretty authentic dresses that they would have worn back in the day and I like to do my hair up how they used to like those big barrel rolls they used to put in their hair lol And yes marrying your first cousin is just weird no matter what time period you do it in lol and I don‚Äôt even think they had pads in the wild west let alone tampons LOL I always wondered how women handled that back then.. very carefully I would assume?üòÜüòÜ along time ago I read somewhere that they would put a woman every month in semi solitude for that week and they would have to live in a separate hut and could only see other women during that week, I‚Äôm talking back In early civilization days I also heard that the Native Americans used to do that too, again very long time ago. The Jewish people actually still sort of do that, (the super serious Jewish people who live in all Jewish communities) it‚Äôs considered a holy time I guess and you‚Äôre not allowed physical contact with your spouse and all sorts of other crazy rules, apparently.. you even have to bring your underwear in for inspection to a rabbi so they can literally freaking inspect the discharge on the underwear!! It blows my mind knowing that people still live that way!!!!

The monarchy‚Äôs all thought that they had to marry brothers and sisters together back in the day to keep their bloodline pure, which is why there are so many genetic disorders in royal bloodlines! Hemophilia comes to mind and I think I remember watching something about King Charles II about how the reason he looked the way he looked (droopy face) and it was because of the royals intermarrying for so long! And a lot of them ended up going mad or were just born like that because of that also. Good rule of thumb don‚Äôt marry ur sister üòÜüòÜ

America hasn‚Äôt been America for a long time, I‚Äôd say probably since the very early 1900s, I mean i‚Äôm sure people in government have always been corrupt But at least after the revolutionary war people actually lived by the principles that the country was founded on and fought for them! They‚Äôre taking away our rights one by one like I said before it‚Äôs turning into almost a police state it‚Äôs horrible! And the media has so many people convinced about all these lies that they tell them, people have just gone completely dumbed down since then, 80% of people back then we‚Äôre illiterate and they were still smarter than people are today! lol I swear ever since the idiot box was invented people have just been getting stupider and stupider yeah I know I love that non-word-wordüòÜlol

This horrible problem that we‚Äôre having with underpaid workers is going to come to a head.. really it‚Äôs just getting worse and worse!

And is your icon a funky looking sheep with long legs? LOL"
3222,Curious if he's ever seen the video on YouTube when in the 80's Cleveland set the record for most balloons let go also causing so much pollution in Lake Erie due to a wind storm. There was so much ballon debris a helicopter coud not see a capsized boat from above  in time and a dude drowned.
3223,What is wrong with people though man? I'm 24 and live in Ohio. Late August and September and October used to be so beautiful. It would cool down and the leaves would change. Then winter would come and we'd have a layer of snow for MONTHS. I'm old and young enough to remember all this. And it seems like we might have another real fall this year; it's starting to cool off a bit. But for the past few years it just stays in the 80s until like mid October and then goes down to like 40s where it stays all winter. I haven't seen a real winter in years. We might get snow cover for a few days. The lake barely freezes anymore. When I was a kid I remember seeing park benches by Lake Erie that would have five inch thick layers of ice on them from spray that froze. Now you only get a handful of freezing days a year. It's SO different from just a decade ago; I don't know how you could be so blind.
3224,"I‚Äôm really sorry guys, not like this. I hope Gase gets fucking dumped in Lake Erie and you get someone good."

3226,"I'm currently growing in the middle of my backyard and dealing with PM, mind you I'm walking distance from Lake Erie. Good luck tho, your plant is a beaut. Hope you give us some pics in a month!"
3227,Ohio sucks but it‚Äôs relatively stable except for Lake Erie getting toxic algae blooms all the time. At least we‚Äôll still have water to treat though.
3228,"Welcome! 

In a lot of ways, the area is very similar to many other places in the country, but the Canton/North Canton area is a pretty good balance of employment opportunity, low cost of living, and things to do. As far as necessities, there is a surprising amount of shopping, from small shops to big sprawling malls. There are a bunch of big chain restaurants, but also many local and small ohio chain restaurants. Great selection and variety of grocery and small convenience stores and discount stores. The area is generally pretty safe and well maintained as far as police, fire, ems, roads and infrastructure. There are good and dependable delivery options for not only mail and packages (like pretty much everywhere in the US), but also restaurant and grocery delivery. Depending on how you like to live, there are rural/residential areas which are still close to major commerce/shopping centers, but are still quiet and out of the way. There isn't much of a conventional urban ""city"" feel in most areas, except for a few interesting historical areas in downtown Canton. There has been a lot of expansion to Stark Parks in recent years, which adds nice options for walking/biking/nature and outdoor activities. There are good lakes within an hour (including lake erie) for boating, fishing and swimming.

Really, it depends on how you would like to live. Do you enjoy the outdoors, or are more of a home body? What type of amenities and activities do you like to be close to?"
3229,"I like it in small quantities or done specific ways (Fish sticks, Fish and chips), I had a bad encounter with some Lake Erie perch (taste the flavor of the Flaming Cuyahoga!) that put me off fish for the better part of two decades. Unfortunately, I didn't tell my parents who continued to feed it to us.

I was always a picky eater and I know the kind of shit I pulled not to eat certain things. Why would I want to have a kid and spend the next decade finding fishsticks in the leaf slides under the dining room table or stashed in a ziplock bag in the back of the closet? Why my dumb ass didn't just throw them in the trash (I think I thought they'd notice?) I'll never know, but aren't you glad I'm not out making more dumb asses like me?

Also, cats rock. Thank you for coming to my picky-eater-fish-stick-smuggler-cat themed Ted Talk."
3230,Ok fine... how about they setup in Lake Erie.  It has t caught on fire from pollution in a decade or two.
3231,"haha oh sorry, yes it definitely is.  Lake Erie is notorious for being extremely polluted.  Lets just say they've found some fish in Lake Erie that are definitely products of extreme mutation. As in multiple species of fish with 2 heads.  Also let me get this straight, Cedar Point is AMAZING (I love roller coasters).  I live in Florida now, so I'm very close to Orlando with Disney and Universal, but they have baby roller coasters compared to Cedar Point.  Miss that place so much."
3232,"You're absolutely right. I think im going to start keeping a log...just for him. Because last time I let him keso track and I had my own little log. He does screw me over majorly. Like he was going to Wal-Mart and would get me like the day old bakery stuff and maybe a few other things. Well when i got down to owing him 100 he still had me at like 600. And I wasnt even counting him alwats going over. He said ""groceries tho"" so I cut that shit out. Lile if you're gonna count it against me at least let me pick what you're buying. Or tell me it goes on what i owe. 

He really pissed me off this summer. We went to lake Erie with him last year (my husband, 2 kids and I) and he covered it...his treat. This year we set the same shit up minus the kids because ...i dont have them anymore because of other issues. So we get to the day -before- we are supposed to leave and he says ""so I figure for gas and taking you out on my boat and bait and blah blah blah I'll charge you 2 hours?"" So I told him I wasnt going. Youre gonna take my husband for free...but I owe you 2 hours of my pussy? Fuck that noise. I get fucking sea sick anyway. I felt bad because my dude really wanted to go but even he said fuck that. We also work on this guys property so he could have charged us that way but decided it was all on me instead."
3233,"Algae uses dissolved CO2 in the water to conduct photosynthesis. Just as CO2 levels are increasing in the air and the oceans, so they are in the lakes-this is a known contributor to the toxic algae blooms in Lake Erie, which are steadily getting worse over time.

Maybe this is an invasive algae species, maybe it isn't, I'm not sure. Probably wouldn't be looking quite so green out there if this was happening in the 1600s, though."
3234,"November is not a good time to visit the Rockies. I-70 isn‚Äôt even low enough to stay out of the snow. And you‚Äôre from Texas where you have zero snow or ice experience. I live in Northeast Ohio‚Äîpeople buy SUVs here thinking it offers magical powers on snow and ice‚Äîand they are usually the ones driving the scariest among the rest of us in our cars. The only real times 4WD is useful is when you‚Äôre stuck in the snow or when you‚Äôre accelerating on snow. It does absolutely no good at all for braking‚Äîand that‚Äôs the thing you miss the most on ice and snow. SUVs are also more top heavy than cars, which makes driving on ice that much more difficult, and makes rolling over more likely. Roads in the mountains are rarely straight, level, or even have guardrails.

We get a ton of snow here in Cleveland thanks to Lake Erie and even I would still think twice about the Rockies in November‚Äîmany passes are over 10,000 feet, and I‚Äôve seen significant snow up that high as early as September. Besides that, I don‚Äôt own a set of tire chains because we salt the roads in the East‚Äîthey don‚Äôt in the West. Chains are absolutely required to drive at times out West. And every rental car contract I‚Äôve ever seen prohibits tire chains‚Äîso that means your insurance won‚Äôt cover you if you wreck‚Äîso you‚Äôre taking on a lot of liability by even thinking of heading into the mountains. It may not snow on your way up, but it may have snowed on a road you take back down.

Also, ski resorts aren‚Äôt even fully up by November. The mountains will still be pretty, but a lot of stuff that‚Äôs open in summer will have closed weeks before. 

And this is all in a normal year. The Rockies in November during a pandemic may be an unbelievably bad time to visit. A lot more things may be closed. We really can‚Äôt even predict what things will be like by then, especially in colder climates deep into fall or getting into winter.

I‚Äôd really recommend going someplace at a lower latitude or a lower altitude. The Colorado Plateau is still nice in November (Southern Utah/Nevada and Northern Arizona), and the crowds may be thinned out. It can still snow, but it won‚Äôt be anything like they get in the Rockies, and it will all melt the next day. That‚Äôs shoulder season instead of offseason for places like Southern Utah."
3235,Drug them and then drop them in the middle of  a Lake Erie sized pool of Jello. Then after 2 days take the body out and burn it so all that‚Äôs left are ashes.

&gt; Nuclear: About 330,000 birds, by Sovacool‚Äôs calculations.

https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/2014/08/22/pecking-order-energys-toll-on-birds

From the paper abstract cited by U.S. News:

&gt; Based on operating performance in the United States and Europe, the paper then offers a preliminary calculation of the number of birds killed per kilowatt-hour kWh generated for wind electricity, fossil fuel, and nuclear power systems. The study estimates that wind farms and nuclear power stations are responsible each for between 0.3 and 0.4 fatalities per gigawatt-hour (GWh) of electricity while fossil fueled power stations are responsible for about 5.2 fatalities per GWh. Within the uncertainties of the data used, the estimate means that wind farms killed approximately 20,000 birds in the United States in 2009 but **nuclear plants killed about 330,000** and fossil fueled power plants more than 14 million. 

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0960148112000857

Edit: furthermore, I found a source offering the actual paper:

&gt; The threat to avian wildlife from nuclear power plants can also be divided into upstream and downstream fatalities.
&gt;Uranium milling and mining can poison and kill hundreds of birds per facility per year. Indeed, in early 2008 the Cotter Corpo- ration was fined $40,000 for the death of 40 geese and ducks at the Ca√±on City Uranium Mill in Colorado. The birds apparently ingested contaminated water at one of the settling ponds at the uranium mine [1]. &gt;These deaths can be very roughly quantified into 0.006 deaths per GWh. &gt;The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service [31] has also noted that abandoned open pit uranium mines in Wyoming can form pit lakes hazardous to wildlife. Uranium-bearing formations are usually associated with strata containing high concentrations of selenium. It is not uncommon for these pits to kill 300 birds per year. Because those mines operated at about one-tenth the efficiency of Canon City, they would correlate to about 0.45 deaths per GWh. &gt;Taking the mean from both uranium mines gets us 0.228 fatalities per GWh.
&gt;Like fossil fueled power stations and wind farms, avian fauna can also collide with nuclear power plants. Three thousand birds died in two successive nights in 1982 from collisions with smoke- stacks and cooling towers at Florida Power Corporation‚Äôs Crystal River Generating Facility [1]. Given that the power plant now hosts an 838 MW nuclear reactor, and presuming it operated with a capacity factor of 90% and that the 3000 deaths were the only ones throughout the year, the facility was responsible for 0.454 avian deaths per GWh. Ornithologists observed 274 fatal bird collisions with an elevated cooling tower at the Limerick nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania from 1979 to 1980 [32]. Since the Limerick plant has a 1200 MW reactor, and also assuming it oper- ated at a 90% capacity factor, it was responsible for 0.261 deaths per GWh. At the Susquehanna plant in eastern Pennsylvania, 1500 dead birds were collected between 1978 and 1986 for an average of 187 fatalities per year [33]. Assuming that the 2200 MW plant operated at 90% capacity factor, it was responsible for 0.01 deaths per GWh. &gt;Extensive surveys for dead birds were also conducted at the Davis-Bess nuclear plant near Lake Erie in Northern Ohio. Orni- thologists recorded a total of 1554 bird fatalities or an average of 196 per year from 1972 to 1979 [33]. Given that the power plant hosts an 873 MW reactor, and assuming it operated with a 90% capacity factor, and the plant was responsible for 0.0285 fatalities per GWh. Taking the mean for each of the four power plants results in 0.188 deaths per GWh.
&gt;The total avian deaths per GWh for nuclear power plants are therefore about 0.416.

3237,"Well, you‚Äôre not entirely wrong. Emissions by individual people aren‚Äôt the big environmental culprits. 

However, if everyone stopped supporting meat/dairy industries there would be a notable impact in a different way. Nutrient pollution from agricultural run off is creating harmful algal blooms throughout freshwater systems in the US, for example. Lake Erie has enormous blooms each year. This creates anoxic zones which obliterate ecosystems. 

Also, in terms of individual emissions. Air conditioning and refrigeration can be pretty big contributors. It‚Äôs actually fascinating, I think. The reason dense urban areas are hotter is mainly because of the feedback from CO2 emissions from air conditioning.

I agree that ultimately it is the hydrocarbon industry and corporations that need to drastically reduce emissions, but we as individuals can have an effect as well."

They dig materials from the bottom of the harbour and channel and place it in that big semi-circle of land.   Mostly the material is clean, but sometimes there are some contaminants from spills and such.  That well would be to monitor every once in a while to check to see if the contaminant levels get too high.  (And FYI&gt; I have a place on the north shore of Lake Erie.  Its nice to see that this stuff is being monitored.  We may be from different countries, but we use the same lake.)"
3253,"Where I'm at on Lake Erie there was to be a species of Blue Pike that dominated portions of the lake. Commercial fishing officially wiped them out in \[1983\]( [https://ohiohistorycentral.org/w/Blue\_Pike?rec=2783](https://ohiohistorycentral.org/w/Blue_Pike?rec=2783)). It's unfortunate because they seemed to be special to the great lakes. Kind of like the Atlantic Salmon used to be.

When I was a kid growing up in the 90s, I remember fishing with my dad and catching buckets full of Yellow Perch. There were times my brother and I were up till 2am scaling fish for dad to filet. Today, at least in the western basin, we'll be doing good to catch at least one man's limit (30) and almost none have the size they used to be. A lot of catches get released."

3293,"I used to be a fuckin mermaid. I'd swim in anything, any time. No matter how deep the water. Lake, river, ocean, murky, cold... never bothered me. 

Until I went swimming in Lake Erie... I was out a good distance and without warning (okay, I was 17 and flirting, there may have been signs) fish began surfacing. Dead fish. It felt like hundreds or thousands (maybe less, but that's what my teenage brain remembered). Maybe the lake turned over in a spot? Methane bubble?  Whatever. No clue

But oh my sweet baby Jesus, swimming through those dead fish to get back to shore? It felt like miles. The dead fish were so thick I couldn't not touch them. These fish were... football sized or so. Every time I kicked, I kicked a fish. Every time I took a stroke, I hit a fish. They slid all over my body. There was no path without a fish. 

It took ages to get to shore. I was in a program for high school kids to get to tour colleges. They paid for everything and we also got to do a bit of fun stuff occasionally, like a beach afternoon. So there was a large group of high school kids to be wrangled up EARLY.  Everyone had to load on the busses and we all had to ride back to the hotel together. Fishy, soggy, and scarred. 

Ever since then, water that I can't see through makes me so uncomfortable. I get shaky, dizzy, light headed, I breathe heavy. Now I have a very hard time even stepping in murky water. Even if it's only a two inch deep puddle my brain freaks out about what might be in there. 

I miss swimming so much. I've gotten a bit better  and have conquered some of the fear. My husband and I went out in our canoe almost once a week all summer long and into the fall. I enjoy the canoeing and even want my own kayak now! But the thought of falling in and what might touch me is always there."

Edit: Imagine the Lake is the pool at the bottom of a fountain, and the rivers are the streams of water that fall down from the top of the fountain. It's one system. If you start scooping water out of the fountain, eventually it will run dry. Piping water to the desert is exactly that.

3298,Not Lake Erie though. The cities along lake Erie are defined by the lake and trade and fishing industries exist because of it there is a very different feeling when looking at an ocean compared to looking at a great lake.

3308,"So I worked for the local conservation authority and a few year ago and attended a conference on the state of the north Lake Erie shoreline.  Basically the issue is a totally natural one.  The Otter Creek and other Creeks like Catfish Creek etc are naturally silty.  The wave action with the sands grittiness and the silt weight combine to create a very abrasive environment at the shoreline.  Currently the north shore of Lake Erie is the fastest changing shoreline in the world.   100 acre farms people used to own have all but vanished.   The road between Port Stanely and Port Bruce had to be moved because it was going to be washed away soon.
Due to the sheer size of the bluffs (nearly 100 feet in most areas), there is no feasible way to engineer anything to stop this.   
I imagine if this was somewhere like a highly populated community in NY or Massachusetts they would throw money at it but because it's in a sparsely populated area with farmland, noone has the money or interest in doing anything about it.  
The government does have a program that allows you to sell off your low value farmland that is likely to be impacted by the erosion, but it's hardly a fraction of the value of similarly sized farmland 1 km inland."

The Cuyahoga River ( KY-…ô-HOG-…ô, or KY-…ô-HOH-g…ô ) is a river in the United States, located in Northeast Ohio, that runs through the city of Cleveland and feeds into Lake Erie. As Cleveland emerged as a major center for manufacturing, the river became heavily affected by industrial pollution, so much so that it ""caught fire"" at least 14 times, most famously on June 22, 1969, helping to spur the American environmental movement. Since then, the river has been extensively cleaned up through the efforts of Cleveland's city government and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA). In 2019, the American Rivers conservation association named the Cuyahoga ""River of the Year"" in honor of ""50 years of environmental resurgence.""

As Cleveland emerged as a major center for manufacturing, the river became heavily affected by industrial pollution, so much so that it ""caught fire"" at least 14 times, most famously on June 22, 1969, helping to spur the American environmental movement. Since then, the river has been extensively cleaned up through the efforts of Cleveland's city government and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA). In 2019, the American Rivers conservation association named the Cuyahoga ""River of the Year"" in honor of ""50 years of environmental resurgence.""

3314,"I was at the first Earth Day in SF, so I‚Äôve been a Tree Hugger ever since. I still work in habitat restoration, a thankless job and rapidly evolving into a futile effort. All I‚Äôve learned over the years about the climate change timeline is being challenged at lightning speed.  Shit‚Äôs going down by centuries and decades faster than I had ever imagined. I‚Äôm not actually afraid, I‚Äôm sickened and saddened at how obvious the events are occurring. I‚Äôm from New Orleans, but moved to Western New York in 1993. I moved into my home Xmas eve 1993 and it snowed 58 straight days. FIFTY EIGHT MOTHERFUCKING DAYS!!! The entire front of my house disappeared as the snow on the ground met the snow on the roof. Several months were spent in walking an ice cave since I had 3 large picture windows down that long hallway. I was living in an ice cave. Snow plow service was $800 for 2 weeks. My driveway is 300 feet and the piles of snow on either side were about 4 feet taller than me, built by a powerful snow thrower. Driving out required getting out...and searching for any approaching vehicles; occasionally visibility was a matter of feet, so adrenaline was the drug of that era.  It was normal to have snowfall at the end of October that required plowing. That‚Äôs not been the case in years.

That was the 90s. Today it‚Äôs 48F. There‚Äôs a mere scattering of snow and you have to look for it! I‚Äôve not needed a snow plow yet. Maybe in February? I checked my weather calendar (I keep my own records) and the usual temp right now was 0F. Yep, ZERO. 20 below was more common than not for several months. I don‚Äôt believe the Lake Erie Ice Dams are an issue like they used to be. Freak shit still happens, some years ago a town north of here got 8 feet of snow overnight. REALLY! Though it was about 60 miles north of me, I had a sunny day. Yeah, shits really weird at this stage. I don‚Äôt envy anyone born in the last decade, but they‚Äôll have nothing to compare it with and they‚Äôll have their own normal. But, just look at the photos of glaciers melting, taken from space. It‚Äôs damned insane. 

Then, there‚Äôs the hurricanes. I moved north because of Hurricane Andrew. I lost friends in Florida and decided I no longer wanted to fight that war. Considering what happened with Katrina, I‚Äôm relieved I did.

Anyway, my best to you! Climate Change is NOT a conspiracy. Spend more time reading what actual climatologists and geologists say about it. Twitter has some fantastic scientists that post daily and love answering stupid questions! Ciao, babycakes!"
3315,"I was forced to take an abstinence pledge and wear a purity ring and everything. I actually just commented on another sub that in a tear-streaked moment of rage I threw the ring into Lake Erie, lol. The whole thing is awful.

As for your phobia of STDs, if possible, I'd recommend finding a healthcare practitioner who has a good bedside manner with STD testing. I switched to seeing a Nurse Practitioner who is affiliated with a local medical school. The med students are younger, and since the practice is affiliated with a university, they see a lot of students. There are no moralizing lectures and there's no shame. Just the doctor or NP saying ""Oh OK you're asking for your recommended tests!"" and doing it without a problem."
3316,"I just visited UP very briefly this year, but grew up on Lake Erie. Huron, Michigan, and Superior are amazingly clean compared to Erie."
3317,"The most polluted environments are state-owned, oceans, rivers, lakes and air. The state allowed their pollution.

If a private firm owned Lake Erie, for example, then anyone dumping garbage in the lake would be promptly sued in the courts for their aggression against private property and would be forced by the courts to pay damages and to cease and desist from any further aggression."
3318,"Yeah, there‚Äôs absolutely no way to describe how much trash Lake Erie is filled with, its actually disgusting. Thank god we can‚Äôt scuba dive here and see what horrors must be sitting at the bottom. It‚Äôs also the most shallow of the Great Lakes, which might aid in the process of the glass making its way to shore"

3329,"The Maumee is the biggest river flowing into Lake Erie, and most of it's watershed is intensively used farm land. Phosphorous loading is driven by agricultural runoff containing fertilizer. This is a well documented phenomenon, and what the map is illustrating. It's a real problem, and agricultural practices are to blame. Urban areas are much less significant factor for this particular issue."
3330,"&gt;Yes, but in a capitalist system we fine and penalize companies that break the rules

Do we? GE never had any issues after the Hudson River incident, and wasn't even forced to clean it up until several decades later, after the fish and sediments in the river would poison you. GM still has former plants in Buffalo draining toxic waste into Lake Erie, and hasn't paid a cent. Occidental petroleum still exists after what happened at Love Canal. Cotter Corp only paid a million dollars for it's flagrant disregard for nuclear safety which contaminated the groundwater beneath Ca√±on City. 

&gt;while in a communist system they'd be shot. Tell me which one is more barbaric.

When the known negligent actions result in multiple deaths, dining the company a pittance and allowing it to continue destroying the environment is far more harmful. 

Say for example, United Carbide and the Bhopal Disaster. Resulted in the death by asphyxiation of over 3,000 Indians and injuries to over a half million. The company was fined a whole $470 million and the decision-makers behind it were slapped on the wrist with a $2,000 fine each. The US actively refused extradition requests for those fugitives, the site itself still hasn't been cleaned up, and UCC was rolled into Dow Chemical."
3331,"Details on the design:

Flag 1 - This design is based primarily on the great lakes that Michigan is surrounded by. The white cross is to signify the winter/cold conditions that the state is known for as well as the snowy land of Michigan. The white cross is also to signify the peace and purity of the state. The four blue squares divided by the white cross signify the four lakes that surround Michigan. Those lakes being: Lake Michigan, Lake Superior, Lake Huron and Lake Erie.

Flag 2- This design has a blue background to signify the great lakes and the water that surrounds Michigan. The Wolverine is then used to signify the people of the state. The wolverine is the unofficial mammal of the state and Michigan is often known as the wolverine state."
3332,Beautiful and clear. Lake Erie would just be a greenish-brown sludge.
3333,"I grew up in MI and lived in PA, IL, and OH. There are some backasswards places in Ohio but Ohio has a mixture of multiple unique ecoregions so there is a ton of diversity here. Lake Erie is one of the most productive fisheries on planet earth, Oak Openings is on the same level of ecological rarity as something like the Everglades. The three C‚Äôs are all cool places with growing populations and opportunities. If you are driving on any major highway it is largely through cornfield, for sure. But there are plenty of good things in Ohio. Jim Jordan is not one of them."
3334,"Rather than there being a river with a waterfall between Lake Ontario and Lake Erie, there will just be a river.

i.e. the falls will erode away, but there will still be water flowing from one lake to the other."
3335,"True, however, Lake Erie is 100 m in elevation higher than Lake Ontario. Lake Ontario getting 50 m higher is going to mess up Toronto for sure."
3336,"Yes, a long ways but decades to make the expansion into other lakes. They are in lake erie and spawn in kettle creek and fingal for example."
3337,"No ,you go to Lake Erie or holiday at haford or love canal instead."
3338,"You also get ""lake effect snow"" in that area. So snowfall gets 10x magnified due to west wind moving off lake erie.  Some areas in the buffalo region get 10 feet of snow/year.

3339,"It was continental glaciers, mainly. No ice shelves to speak of on the west coast, known, on east coast, possibly when manhattan was under 2 miles of glacial ice, but not much at all in the US.

Continental glaciers stretched from Hudson bay down into Iowa, and north part of ohio. Still have the big hills of glacial moraine in Ridge Tp., near Wyandot Co. and Hancock.

Massive glaciers gouged out most of Lake Erie and the other Great Lakes. Near Perry's island there are glacial grooves upwards of 8 feet in depth, to give some idea.

Glacial grooves also on limestone bedrock near BG State University. I pointed those out to the geologists, but they never got back to me. Later, emailed a geologist there and he said they knew of them, but had no idea I was the field tripper who found them.

When millions of sq. miles of glacial ice sheets began to melt, the land connections between India and Sri Lanka were severed as the oceans rose.  This important fact was missed..

It's how events in North America affected sea levels 1/2 a world away.

If another ice age recurred, Sri Lanka could become a state of India once again."

3345,"Yes. I spent time in Ontario in the rural and vacation spots of Lake Erie. Been to Qubec briefly. The French influence gets extra saucy. If Canada doesnt completely sell out to China, I'd love to visit the BC wilderness and the people out that way"
3346," It was weird being on a beach and not smelling salt water.   I grew up next to the ocean, going to the beach almost daily.     Really threw me off visiting lake Erie.  Just didn't smell 'right'."
3347,"Yeah, I live close to the shore of Lake Ontario.  Not only are there waves in the wintertime (before global warming) it wasn't uncommon to have at least an inch of ice on the lakeside of your house if you lived close to the shore.  No a days they'll just flood your basement or land. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another fun fact is you can tell the significance of a lake on where the word lake is when you state the landmark.  For example, Lake Ontario, Lake Erie in comparison to say the Finger Lakes (a series of lakes in central NY).  When Lake is in front of the name it is meant for the significance of the size."
3348,"You're right. The study says the carp from Eastern Lake Erie were ~~100 times~~ more contaminated than nearby lakes.

Edit: PCB levels 100x higher than PBDE

""The total PCB concentrations in muscle of male carp from eastern Lake Erie (ranging from nd to 15,000 ng g(-1) lipid) were 100-fold higher than the total PBDE observed (1.5-100 ng g(-1) lipid), indicating a higher level of contamination of PCBs in Lake Erie."""

3352,"Temperature isn't the issue, you can jump in cold water for a minute and be fine.

The currents, debris under it, along with the disease in it is the concern. Old sewer systems in the city mean storm sewers and human waste can just get dumped into the river. The industry dumps into the river toxic chemicals.

It's not a ""you will die if you go in"", but I'd much go swimming in Lake Erie first."

3354,My parents are in west Seneca. It‚Äôs quite the Lake Erie dump zone.
3355,Not even Detroit. Like landing in Lake Erie when it was still on fire
3356,"Ill second this advice. Im in PA, i can catch through the winter but it took some time to find where. I personally have an easier time on the rivers because the comfortable areas are further limited by current- carp are cold blooded, if they dont move they dont have to eat. Food is scarce in the winter so they dont want to move. Eddys behind big rock croppings or jettys, the sunny side of bays, any slow water on the warmer side is great. Bait wise i prefer a harder method mix in the winter bc you can sit on it and fish will bang it around and let you know they are there. They bite wicked light sometimes in the cold and its good to get some feedback to know you are on the right track. Also, warm water discharges are killer. Theres less and less of them these days since the best ones were attached to coal power plants but there used to be a popular one on lake Erie in Ohio. I never made the trip years ago when i travelled a lot for carp, maybe its still there. I used to go to a wwd in Alexandria VA and one in middle PA that were both killer even in the coldest weather but both are gone for a few years now. If you can find groundwater springs those can be hot spots too. Take note of the last spots to freeze in your local waters. I‚Äôd ask some locals in CAG and or ACS they may share some secrets one wouldn‚Äôt give up online."
3357,"Summary

""He was born on the day the last strip was published; his grandpa put a stuffed tiger named Hobbes in his crib; and he even had a best friend named susie. Then Calvin's mom washed Hobbes to death, susie grew up beautiful and stopped talking to him, and Calvin pretty much forgot about the strip - until now. Now he is 17 years old and has been diagnosed with schizophrenia. Hobbes is back, as a delusion, and Calvin cant control him. Calvin decides that watterson is the key to everything, if he would just make one more comic strip, but without Hobbes, Calvin would be cured. Calvin and susie (is she real), and Hobbes (he cant be real, can he?) Set out on a dangerous trek across frozen lake Erie to track down Watterson."
3358,"I lived on Lake Erie in Canada growing up.  The bay  to the south was called Pigeon Bay. We were along the migratory route for passenger pigeons at the turn of the century. Apparently the sky would literally be darkened for a day or three each year as they migrated.  You could hunt pigeons with a bat,  swinging it in the air to get your dinner.  It‚Äôs incredible to think how there could have been that many and now there are none.  I heard the same story about ‚Äòfishing‚Äô for sturgeon in Lake Erie.  You could go out in a row boat (a big one meant for the task) with a couple of guys and a club and and hit them in the head and pull them into the boat because there were so many of them.  Now they are endangered although the population is recovering somewhat."

3363,Lake Erie is one of the only places it's particularly common. The Era blue glass was especially popular people would dump their garbage in lake leading to a relatively high concentration.

I‚Äôve seen trucks parked facing the lake getting blasted by waves for fun. My uncle had a house right there on the lakeshore. He‚Äôs been evacuated before. Previous owners had a car in the garage - the house is *between* the lake and the garage.  The water level was so high that the car floated out of the garage and swept out into the lake.  He found seashells on the I-beams that support the ground level of his house which means the basement was probably full of water at some point.

3372,"I regularly fish when its below freezing, i live off of lake erie so maybe im just used to it. However, a winter hat and boots are a necessity. Then wear some jeans or heavy kakis, wear a sweatshirt layered under a thick denim jacket, like a carhart one. Wear scarf or face mask if you like. Your hands will get cold before anything else, and thats inevitable, but you should be able to keep the rest of ya warm. Edit: cant forget the long johns"

3375,"I take that as punish myself more. I've also been to every major and all but a couple minor cities in the entire country. The only places I hate more than ohio are the northeast states. Overpopulation and high humidity are two of my biggest deal killers.

Spend some serious time in the western 11 states and you'll hate it here too. Nothing is more serene to me than looking at fourteens with glacial snow on them. Have you ever even heard the term fourteen before?  What is our highest elevation, a few hundred feet higher than Lake Erie? Whatever it is, it wouldn't even make a pimple on a mountain's ass. Do you like lake Erie when it's at its greenest or brownest?

How about all the muddy man made impoundments they call Lakes here? Look it up on Wikipedia. Michigan has thousands of crystal clear natural Lakes.....ohio has a few dozen if I recall. Google search photos of any western range and tell me it's ugly....I dare you. Hocking Hills and the Cuyahoga Valley are tiny and really sad compared to anything in the western states.

On a nice clear day from a hilltop you can see almost a 100 miles out west. What about here? Maybe 20? How many moose, wolves, sheep, goats or elk are kicking around our tiny ""wild"" areas? Mostly just deer and a bunch of possum and coon. After spending time where the humidity is low the air here leaves a person feeling slimy. 

Have you ever seen the night sky from the middle of the Great Plains somewhere? It's almost shocking. Ohio has a terrible night sky. Most of the water here is super hard and leaves a person feeling dirty after a shower, most water in the plains and mountain states is really soft so you feel squeaky clean after a shower.

After working in Montana 20 years ago I still long to be there like no place else.

Come on well travelled people, help 'splain the facts to this person."
3376,Is Lake Erie the most polluted out of the Great Lakes?

3381,"I love all of the Hocking Hills parks (there are also some amazing and secret nature preserves that you have to get permits to visit- Boch Hollow, Saltpetre Cave, Sheick Hollow)  The Toledo metro parks are some of the best in the nation.

I live by Lake Erie and our algae blooms have been getting worse every year but my RO has options for numerous cartridges you can add depending on your water concerns/needs. I added a VOC guard. If you‚Äôre researching take that into account when comparing systems because some are just a basic filter and that‚Äôs it. Not sure what contamination shtf you may need to prep for where you live."
3383,"I hate that sticker. But I live on the banks of Lake Erie in Ohio, and let me tell you what, the salt around this parts will absolutely decimate your car. You can have a perfectly clean rust free vehicle and it will be a heaping pile of rust after one winter. You gotta wash that shit of constantly. It‚Äôs absurd."
3384,"Yeah some nasty shit washes up in any body of water. I live in Lake Erie and there‚Äôs a little beach (like 8ft wide) right down the street from my house. I go down and look for sea glass pretty often. I‚Äôve seen several bandaids, they are the worst for me. And lots of little plastic shards and even a rusty battery once. I like to think of all the stuff that‚Äôs in the lake that‚Äôll prob never wash up. Thousands of cell phones I‚Äôm sure and probably even some bodies lol. Maybe even gold.. we may never know!"

3392,"Boulder County:

Normally I‚Äôm below Lake Erie, but last week we actually traveled to a familiar location. Went from people rarely wearing masks (cleveland)to people everywhere following the mask orders (most of Colorado). The only time people did not was in Estes Park area, and it outweighed those that did. The economy is still strong, yet I see more homeless in the state &amp; for the first time I saw what would normally be a ‚Äòmountain settler‚Äô asking for grain, not money or services rendered. These are the type of people that come into town 2/3 times per year for goods. So that tells me stores are out of normal supplies in the area. Although a trip to both large &amp; small grocery stores showed little signs of empty shelves, so this might be very location specific. People in both states are definitely on edge no matter who you talk to, with a bit of hopium still lingering in Colorado. The fires are still going on in the west, with ash raining, &amp; smoke filled skies everyday. People rarely talk about it, but joke when they do, almost as if to help with their ‚Äònew‚Äô reality. You also see planes come through on their way to dump water on the fire, which is a total reality check for me. Now to decide what is safest, a whole home in the mountain side or a house in the great rust belt below Lake Erie."
3393,"I‚Äôve always pulled for you guys, especially during some extra dark years here in Cleveland.  If only you guys held onto Caldwell...  but we know quite a bit about poor management decisions here as well.  Stay strong, Lake Erie bro."
3394,I grew up in Ohio but somehow caught Canadian stereotype of apologizing. Should we tell people Lake Erie is infected or just leave it?
3395,"Lake Erie is the smallest by volume and has faaar more industrial, residential, and agricultural watershed than any of the other lakes. Making it prime for pollution. Nowadays the problem is agricultural runoff which causes all the algal blooms, not so much industrial waste"
3396,"Yeah excess nitrogen and phosphorus allowing algea to boom in population, sucking oxygen and most other resources from aquatic environments, leaving little chance for other aquatic species to survive. The process is called eutrophication. Very common to see in small ponds and lakes but a body of water the size of lake erie, its difficult for it to remain consistent so the result is the algal blooms all in the news. Very bad for the ecosystem, can be toxic to humans and animals."

3398,If it weren't for the invasive zebra mussels I don't think Lake Erie would have recovered.
3399,"Now something similar is happening with Lake Erie but on the other side of the lake. In Toledo, the Maumee and other rivers have been dumping so much fertilizer run off from the nearby industrial farms. This has caused sever algae blooms on the lake over the last 10 years or so, and it got so bad that at one point the entire city of Toledo was placed on a boil advisory for nearly a week and people where panicking. 

In an attempt to fix this problem the  city of Toledo passed the Lake Erie bill of rights by referendum, and the state government stepped in and declared it unconstitutional further allowing the pollution of the water source for Ohio 4th largest city. This shit still happens to this day people."
3400,pollution can also set rivers on fire.  Lake Erie used to have this problem before they started cleaning it up.
3401,"Yeah... Erie and the rivers that flow into it have been polluted horribly. If you ever went to a Lake Erie beach, you'd likely remember all the dead fish that would float ashore because of the toxic waters"
3402,"I know the EPA has been working for half a century to clean up the disaster that was Lake Erie, but every time I go to Cedar Point, it seems like that lake smells different from the rest of the Great Lakes"
3403,I heard Lake Erie is still very polluted
3404,"Yeah, there‚Äôs a pilot project under development for Lake Erie but 99.99% of offshore wind will be in the ocean for the next decade. It requires huge and specialized equipment that you need to be able to move by water from a specialized port...on the ocean. Lake Erie can use the Seaway to bring ships from the Atlantic but the Seaway can‚Äôt accommodate ships big enough for the new generations of offshore wind equipment, so it‚Äôs sort of a dead-end."
3405,"I used to think everywhere else was better than Ohio:

* Colorado: Sun &amp; Mountains
* Arizona: Deserts &amp; Nice Winters
* Florida: Palm Trees/Nice Winters
* South Carolina: Beaches &amp; Warmth
* Michigan: Beaches &amp; Nice Summers

As I've grown, I've realized the trade-offs:

* Colorado: brown and expensive
* Arizona: very brown, no grass, oppressive summers
* Florida: bugs, humidity, hurricanes
* South Carolina: see Florida, less hurricanes
* Michigan: Michigan sucks, don't even consider it. Go Bucks!

Seriously though, we have the following:

* Very green &amp; lush
* Mild summers &amp; winters (just really not too extreme on either end)
* Some foothills
* Islands that are pretty cool, maybe some decade lake Erie won't be so polluted from runoff.
* Basically no natural disasters (very rare)
* Great cost of living
* Easy access to East coast &amp; Chicago or St. Louis.

Our forest parks are beautiful year round...and they're everywhere."
3406,"That's what I mean, it outlives its predecessors and continues to stand tall and thrive for a long time. Although, I'm sure Lake Erie will rise before we have enough time for all that."
3407,"I grew up at my grandparents cottage on Lake Erie. There use to be 3m of beach. For the past 25 years it slowly diminished. Now it‚Äôs about a metre high at the storm wall. Lake Huron use to have 10m beaches in areas. Now some spots aren‚Äôt even big enough to put a beach chair. 

I live 5km away from Lake Ontario. In the spring the water levels get so high they have to close the trails around it. By the summer most of the trails remained closed as they have been washed out. 

It‚Äôs terrifying to see. A city like Toronto floods whenever they get a massive rain storm because their system can‚Äôt survive with the high water levels."
3408,"It really comes down to where you live. Check how your municipality is handling waist and recycling and from there you can make the decision as to what you should do. 

Unfortunately paper absolutely does damage in the oceans. It‚Äôs hard to track how much damage because it dissolves in the ocean. whether it‚Äôs absorbing h2o molecules resulting in increased salt concentrations or the bleach used in the paper poisoning the water, paper is a huge problem. 


Anything heavier than water is disastrous to the ocean. In Lake Erie they found that metal and glass covered the lake floor choking out the plants and animals that lived there."

It's 120 miles long but only connected by the 20 yard wide Edison Bridge over Sandusky Bay and the Magee Marsh, neither of which are inhabited by actual people. It has been argued that the district isn't even contiguous when the Lake Erie water level is high.

5. Detroit (two lakes within driving distance)
6. Louisville (South/Midwest. Has characteristics of Rust Belt though)

16. Dayton (In comfortable distance of Cincy, Indy and Columbus!)
17. Toledo (If you were a madman you could commute to Detroit, Fort Wayne, Ann Arbor, or even Cleveland. Notice I said madman)
18. Ann Arbor (a bit on the more expensive side)

Yes, some of these cities might be expensive, but the Midwest's definition of expensive is different than the coastal's definition of expensive."
3420,"For distance perspective go to a place where you can see far, or look at landscape photography. 

You will see that the further away the objects are the more muted and less vibrant tone tones are. Especially true in cityscapes. The air has polution, normal air properties that does this.

I am looking at the sky this morning over lake erie, I see that the closer to the horizon the white the sky and it transitions to sky blue over me. That is the lite particles bouncing off the particles in the air.

For trees the internal and deeper parts of the forest are near black. Play with tone(lite to dark spectrum of the colour). Same with your foreground. 

Your composition is good you have foreground (flowers) mid (trees) and back sky. With playing with tone of colours you will find that makes a big difference.

ECOT disputed this, disagreeing with the way the state calculated student participation. In January 2018 ECOT then offered a lower settlement amount, but the department refused that offer and insisted on full repayment. In turn, the board of ECOT's sponsor (Educational Service Center of Lake Erie West) voted to close the school immediately.

3430,"This is what the shoreline looks like from Lake Erie, through Lake Ontario and all the way through the St. Lawrence River. The water level has been about 1.5-2 feet above normal levels for a couple years and all of the docks are submerged under 6 inches of water. 

With the Lakes not experiencing tides it is common to build docks/piers that are a foot or 2 above normal water level. Nobody expected 3-4 years of higher than average rainfall in the Great Lakes drainage basin."

(he also hires undergrads for research if you‚Äôre interested) both are super good resources on what fabe can do for you. it‚Äôs a really flexible degree based on what you‚Äôre interested in due to the electives you can take. in my experience internships that i‚Äôm interested in are usually posted in dec/jan/feb time. don‚Äôt get too stressed about not finding one now. i would definitely check with odnr, oepa, oda if you‚Äôre interested in getting into public sector. most of the private sector is basically consulting work (example: i shadowed this guy who did wetland mitigation cases, where he would go out to sites, see if an area would be considered a wetland, and if buildings could be built there and if they would have to recreate a wetland somewhere else.)"

3435,"My best guess- is that it's an old water sampling site. Apparently from the 90s to the mid 00s there was a restoration project to revive the Robinson River,  which is what the stream in Whiteoak Canyon feeds into.  Now i can't find a sampling station at the start of any of the creeks and streams that feed into the river but i did find a watershed analysis of the water in Shenandoah.  The maps in their document have several different kinds of stations that they (the researchers) sampled from.  Also if you search for water sample stations in Shenandoah, you'll get all kinds of links for different kinds of analysis done in the park ranging from discussing water pollution caused by live stock, to suitable pH levels for fish,  monitoring algae blooms, and so on and so forth.  

I don't think it's a pump station, mostly because the water pump stations for hikers are at camp sites and cabins. The park says ""no camping"" on the limberlost trail. Maybe a long time ago, there was a camp site, but it's such a well maintained and easy to hike trail for the park, that it doesn't seem as likely of an answer as the sample station idea.

3436,"The Cuyahoga was basically one of the most polluted rivers in the world at the time. Pollution was and is a serious problem in the Rust Belt (Detroit, Cleveland, Pittsburgh and the areas around them) where there used to be just a ton of industry (coal, steel and automotive industries especially, none of which are terribly clean). The Cuyahoga runs directly through Cleveland and pretty much right on the banks are the steel yards and assorted factories, so they all just used to dump straight into the river. This in turn caused a river that more oozed than flowed and had solid layers of oil and trash on top. That‚Äôs what caught fire.

It got cleaned up and it‚Äôs much better now. Its still not a nice river, but fluke oil tanker accidents aside it doesn‚Äôt catch fire anymore and you can be next to it without getting sick.

If I remember correctly the whole third floor of the Great Lakes Science Center (in Cleveland and right on the shore of Lake Erie) is actually about the Great Lakes, the water cycle and the pollution of the Cuyahoga and the effort to clean it up. It‚Äôs a fun little place to go if you‚Äôre in Cleveland, especially if you have kids."
3437,"Case and point there is a house for sale for $60,000 that is $200,000 below the cheapest houses in my area. Why isn't it selling that is a great deal!?

3439,"Their golf course lawns and arborvitae rows and synthetic fertilizers are also playing a major role in destroying the environment. Comes back to bite us when we end up like Lake Erie with massive algae blooms and have to cut city water supplies. Albeit that‚Äôs more from agriculture but domestic use has some contribution as well. 

Keeping up with the Jones‚Äôs is a real serious issue. 

I would recommend getting composted material like composted leaf litter but also composted green matter if you can get your hands on it to bump your N content. Put that down beneath your mulch.

Unfortunately, those short term benefits of using synthetic fertilizers can make your problem worse over time as different soil dwelling organisms that really highly impact your tree‚Äôs development rely on organic nitrogen sources too.

Generally the water is clean and safe for swimming, but to ensure public safety the national lakeshore regularly tests the water for contamination of bacteria. Also can be some dangerous waves and currents. Lake Erie however is the most polluted"
3442,"I grew up in Ohio. I just recently moved away and honestly it has a bad rap but ohio has several places that are pretty enough to make it onto here, they are just not well known or talked about because most people assume its just all farmland or rust belt cities(which a lot of it is). But I highly recommend looking into Cuyahoga Valley National Park, Hocking Hills State Park, Mill Creek State Park, the lake erie islands, etc.. You have to look a little harder in Ohio to get out of the bland areas, but Ohio def has its share of hidden gems. I'm living in Florida currently and I'd take some of the forests up there over the swampy pine ones and zero geology down here any day. Shitty winters though, and the area I lived in in particular had awful political views which is also a big reason I left."

3455,"50 years ago, Lake Erie was a symbol of man's disregard for his environment. The results of unfettered dumping of raw sewage and industrial effluent added the word ""eutrophication"" to Americans' vocabulary.    My Mom, who grew up in Buffalo, can remember the signs on the beaches advising people not to swim. Cleveland was an especially large contributor to this dead zone, infamously, the Cuyahoga River caught fire in 1969. So, in 1972, the Cleveland Regional Sewer Commission was created. Sewage treatment was greatly improved with spectacular results.

Lake Erie still suffers from algal blooms, but almost all of that is caused by [fertilizer runoff](https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/jg0x8p/sources_of_phosphorous_in_lake_erie/)."
3456,"A big reason Lake Erie got it so badly too is that it is so shallow. It makes it much easier for these issues to pop up. All the other great lakes are much deeper.

I go swimming on the lake regularly on the Canadian side, the shallowness means it gets much warmer than the other great lakes, which makes for great swimming. Also makes it much more susceptible to algae blooms and pollution.

Lake Erie is a nice toasty pool temperature by mid June typically, while Lake Ontario is still freezing cold. Lake Ontario's warmest temperatures are typically way below Lake Erie.

Because of this Lake Erie is the only great lake to regularly completely freeze over in the winter. The others are so deep that they keep heat longer, keeping the ice off of them."

There's still actually an ongoing cleanup process in Hamilton now that the steel industry is largely crippled. Also if you visit Hamilton (you don't want to) you're still able to smell all the pollution when you're near the lake."

So I realize most people won't be able to read the article. Basically he diverted funds that were supposed to be used for planning and development and bought a bunch of gift cards like $200,000 worth, and he is now saying that he tried to save those businesses. But it was completely arbitrary as to which businesses got chosen.

And he didn't tell anyone that he was going to do this.

Half the article is him defending himself by saying that he was responsible for revitalizing muskegon's downtown or whatever, which may be true, but is sort of beside the point.

He illegally tapped funds to access these gift cards, but that part is buried in the article. The whole thing is very sympathetic to him. I consider this an outrage.

I really dislike the Detroit news, but I subscribe to it (and Freep) because I believe in local journalism. And the Detroit news does good work.

The official map was drawn with straight lines and didn‚Äôt include the actual ‚Äúheadwaters‚Äù so the Crown issued paperwork and ‚Äúreclaimed‚Äù them in the the late 1800s. The issue came up in 1993 when they started to build a new housing development in First Nation land. They went to court in 1995 but the court refused to hear arguments. They have continually protested by singing, dancing, and constructing tipis/wigwams. 

This bigger issue is the pipeline. It‚Äôs one of the most massive above ground tubes on earth. The Wet ºsuwet ºen people have a right to the land from the river source to the lake. If the pipeline failed it would contaminate the river from its source. The oil would penetrate the water table, the land on either side of the river would be spoiled for miles all down the river and their land would be ruined. 

You couldn‚Äôt do as much damage as an oil spill if you were burning and salting the earth. Their ancestors fought for Canada and lost life and land in a war that wasn‚Äôt about them. They‚Äôre rightfully pissed, and to lean into the trope, I don‚Äôt think a bunch of natives with thousands of years of local hunting experience would have a hard time getting actually violent in towns with a couple hundred people and half a dozen sheriffs. But looks like they don‚Äôt want blood just not to get screwed by a government their families died for."

Basically the roots of trees create a more compact sub soil which prevents nutrients which can be harmful to surface water and other eco systems like lakes. You ever see that nasty blue green algae that buildups in Lake Erie ? Soil erosion and runoff is a big factory that causes  those huge algae blooms (which btw can be poisonous to fish, animals and humans). 
This is just one example but to keep it simple more trees = Less erosion = cleaner water = cleaner earth. 
Oh another great thing more trees do is reduce the urban heat island effect through evaporative cooling :)"
3478,"I am not surprised by this reaction one little bit. I saw this coming back in 1987, so if anyone is interested, here's my ""This is why I'll *never* visit our benighted neighbors to the north ever again"" rant.

My girlfriend and me spent a few weeks in the summer of '87 driving around and camping in northern Michigan. I'd brought with me what was probably the cheapest mouse gun available at the time, a Raven Arms .25 Auto and a couple boxes of ammo, just to plink with. At one point we decided it would be kinda cool to visit Canada too, so we got the map out and decided to cross over at Sault Ste. Marie and sight see through to the Canadian side of Niagara Falls, where we'd cross back into the U.S. and drive home along Lake Erie back to Ohio.

So we pull up to the border station and there's a sign says something like ""take this lane if you have anything to declare."" Now I didn't know if I needed to ""declare"" this little handgun, but I knew Canadians were kinda funny about guns, so I figured better safe than sorry. I pulled into the designated lane and smiled and told the nice man there I had a handgun packed away in the back and wasn't sure if I needed to mention it. I swear his pasty face paled just a little bit as he directed me to a specific parking area.

The minute I stopped multiple border agents swarmed the car, ordered the two of us out, and demanded to know where the gun was. ""Well"" I said, ""it's in that backpack in the back seat, unloaded. Seems like this is a big deal to you guys, huh? I mean, you understand *I* told *you* it was there, right? There's nothing nefarious going on here, we're just camping!""

So they safely located the dangerous weapon, and then proceeded to pull every last thing we owned out of the car and dump it on the oil-stained pavement to be pawed through. Every dirty sock, every pair of underwear. There were sniffer dogs. At one point a border agent pulled a crushed empty cigarette pack from the *very* bottom of a sleeping bag and demanded to know ""who this belongs to"" as he slowly pulled it apart with gloved hands, looking for drugs? Explosives? Jimmy Hoffa?? 

They then took us into separate rooms and had us strip so they could paw through the clothes we were wearing too. When we got back to the car and *all* our stuff unpacked and strewn out on the lot, our cooler dumped and our food on the pavement, they said we could put our things back now.

""So what about my gun?"" You can't just bring a gun into Canada sir. ""Ok, but I'm sure as hell not letting you keep it, what now"" Well sir...so there was an hour and a half of forms to be filled out and lots of bureaucratic sneers and indignation that I would dare enter this other Eden, this demi-paradise with a dirty dirty gun, and the upshot was, I had to come back to this border crossing to reclaim my horrible weapon or forfeit it, which was clearly what they expected to happen.

So we went to Niagara Falls (was pretty cool) and drove all the way back to claim my shitty little Raven out of general goddamn principal. This process was *of course* a multi hour, multi-form filled exercise in manufactured difficulty designed by hoplophobic bureaucrats to dissuade people like me from despoiling their frozen Hoser paradise of enforced passivity with my can-plincking-in-the-woods ways! And they were successful. As I walked back to my car with my cheap little gun to drive the long way home from Michigan, I scraped the toxic, benighted queen-worshipping Canadian soil from my feet and vowed never enter their country again, and I never have.

Oh Canada, you've got some good things, like your health care system, but your current enthusiasm for becoming disarmed peasants is *exactly* what I would have predicted all those years ago. Enjoy!"

Going long LOGI. In January I was buying Webcams and computer accessories Logitech was the **bestselling** manufacturer in **every category**. I checked the same stuff that I bought in January in March and most of them are **sold out** and on back order. Third party sellers were asking $90 for a webcam I paid $30 for. My mouse was $15 but now going for $25. They also own **Blue Microphones** (Blue Yeti and Blue Snowball) **Jaybird** and **Astro Gaming.** Is Logitech expensive? Today it's at the same price as January. A lot of companies are **reimbursing staff for buying telecommunication equipment** such as webcams for zoom, teams, google hangout, .... Logitech had the top 3 bestselling webcams. Even some of their computer speakers are on backorder. 

With schools closing early a lot of guys bought their peripherals for **gaming**. Their gaming products even have their own supreddit r/LogitechG. As we know gaming stocks have been on fire. Even one of the posts making to r/all was a LifeProTip to buy a good webcam to look good for work. 

People are starting to pick up on this trend. I was listening to a podcase in which an old grandma called and asked about investing in Logi just because she had noticed the pattern. I also noticed three of our members independently picked up on that pattern too: u/TorpCat an European dude, u/NicklasL1dstrom a gamer and sports fan from usa, and lastly u/MattMDL a gamer who understand computer peripherals.

3495,"Building off of what u/undergroundmike said, many older cities have a combined sewer system. This means that at some point down the line, the storm and sanitary sewers are combined into one line leads to a water treatment plant. The treatment plants are designed to be able to handle a certain volume of sanitary sewer waste, but when it rains a lot, there is simply too much volume for the capacity of the treatment plant. Rather than hold the extra water in the sewers and let it back up into the streets and eventually into peoples homes, the sewers have an emergency overflow that dumps into your nearest water body. This is why sometimes the beaches close for unsafe bacteria levels after heavy rains. Lake Erie gets full of poop water. 

These days, new sewers are always kept separated. It is really expensive to separate the old sewers, though. The CSO tunnels are one solution to hold the extra volume until excess capacity is available at the plant. 

I‚Äôve been in these tunnels - AMA!"
3496,"This has been a problem all through out the Great Lakes. I am curious to hear more about your situation, I like to know what's going on farther up the Great Lakes before it gets down to Niagara Falls and Lake Erie. Lake Ontario's shoreline has been up about 5-10 feet higher this year (it's been even higher than that in the past few years, hovering around 20 feet higher). A shit ton of Land along the NY Ontario shoreline has been lost due to the higher water line. It's been wiping out docks/boat houses and creating massive flooding issues everywhere. Lake Erie's level has also been up higher, I know of erosion problems along the shore line of Buffalo and Western New York too.  


Where I live, the lower Niagara river is also up about 5-10 feet higher and some of the landmark rocks below Niagara Falls are no longer visible. I look at the river all day long while I am at work and I have never seen it as high as it has been the past couple of years (been working at the same place for almost 10 years, plus lifelong resident). It has made some of the work my crew does harder (since some areas are submerged deeper than usual and the Falls flow rate is increased). A significant amount of water is diverted away from going over Niagara Falls and into the hydro-electric power plant reservoirs, I can only imagine how much worse the water level would be if we didn't have that ability to control the flow rate and store the excess water for later use. A bit higher up the upper Niagara river, before the the water plunges over the falls and into the Niagara gorge, some neighborhoods located along the river have had flooding problems recently.  


 Here, there is a big controversial fight about the international treaty, Plan 14, between NY and Canada. The plan basically calls for the more of the water to be contained in Lake Ontario instead of diverted downstream through the Saint Lawerence river/Seaway and along Ontario's watershed, in order to prevent the city of Montreal from getting flooded out. So people in this region have come to believe that the reason why the lake and river levels have been increasing is due to a foreign city (Montreal) can benefit at their expense.  


But that's bullshit in my opinion, because the water level is high every where through out the Great Lakes. It's not just isolated to Lake Ontario and it's not like all that water is getting backed up through the Great Lakes just because of Montreal. I did my final university internship with a local soil and water conservation district (each NY county has a government organization that monitors the county's soil/water health). Every single stream, creak and spring's water level  in the county that we measured was up significantly higher than it has been historically. These streams, creeks and springs are directly flowing into the Niagara river and Lake Ontario. One main reason for the increased water level, is that we are still receiving about the same amount of precipitation through out the year, but the winters have become much more milder and warmer than they usually are historically. So all precipitation isn't getting stored as snow or ice through out the winter and slowly released in the spring/summer. It's just coming right down and melting right away into the watershed. The oxygen and flow rate were also both way up, while the turbidity was down, meaning that the rate of which the water is getting released into the watershed may also be way up high.

3504,"The reservoir in Tokyo is for flood storage so that the water doesn‚Äôt get released untreated after a huge rain. The reservoir you see in Cleveland is for storing drinking water, or for water that will be treated for drinking water. Cleveland also has a new network of flood storage tunnels under the city that serve the same purpose as Tokyo‚Äôs flood storage. 

Cleveland and most other older cities have separate sanitary and storm sewers, but the overflow channels for these are combined‚Äîso whenever we get a heavy rain, storm waters overflow and raw sanitary sewage gets mixed in with the storm water. Cleveland‚Äôs sewer plants try to treat the water, but usually the overflow would flood the treatment plants as well, so at that point storm water with raw sewage gets discharged into Lake Erie. One such outlet can be found on the dog beach at Edgewater Park. This is why Lake Erie is unsafe to swim in after a storm‚Äîbecause of the raw sewage discharged. The storage tunnels under the city are intended to hold the overflow water until after the storm, when the treatment plants will have capacity to pump them out and treat all the water. This will make Lake Erie way healthier, and not just to swim in. The phosphorus that feeds toxic algae blooms often comes from raw sewage...and even more from agricultural runoff...which is because they fertilize fields with the equivalent (or actual) of poop from animals."

LA was like the pollution photos of China, every day.  Companies dumped their toxic wastes into the ground.  Smokestacks in production companies just let toxic waste into the air.  Companies strip mined minerals and clear cut forests to make their products affordable to a country that was trying to improve the standard of living at an affordable cost.  The name of the game was improving standards of living at all costs.  The whole country was like this.  That engineer just did what everyone else was doing.

It was the boomers who inherited this mess and cleaned it all up at astronomical cost, and forced the country to stop polluting as much, which increase costs further.  One of the reason that colleges were affordable until then was the country had money in excess due to routine exploitation of the environment.  The politicians solution to the demands of the boomers to not only pay for the cleanup but also increase the ongoing costs of production without changing the standard of living of the country was to basically steal money from education, and pay civil servant's salaries with preposterous pensions.

Those are both the same thing: we basically financed costs that previously had been paid in full, so that we could have a better environment while not giving up our standard of living.  Instead of the boomers paying for your college when you went like their parents before, we let you finance it and pay it later.  Instead of paying civil servants a salary, WE paid them less and let YOU pay them a preposterous pension while providing you no services.

The beaches there are are public access and its rare for a house to have a decent beach unless they spent a bunch of money making one themselves. Most of the lake shore housing is cliffside really. Occasionally a house will have stairs down to a dock, but erosion has become so problematic on the lake shore most of those have been removed or are just hazardous.

There's also a lot of dumb shit on the shoreline west of Cleveland that makes it suck a little bit more than it should. There are a few power plants and a bunch of lakeside heavy industry shit that mucks everything up.

3524,"Grew up boating on Lake Erie, so same! Columbus is great, but the lack of real water (muddy rivers and man made lakes) is a downer. That being said, the drive out to Lake Hope State Park is worth it. Pretty lake. Remote. Kayaking and paddle board friendly. Cheers!"
3525,"We have one here underneath lake erie. It's crazy to think 2000ft underneath all that water people are down there mining salt. If you google Cargill salt mine you can see pictures of it, knowing it's a mine is one thing but knowing there's an entire lake above you is nuts."
3526,"We got onto the topic of the environment at work. We are in northern Kentucky (important). A coworker chimes in that she doesn‚Äôt care about litter or waste here because we aren‚Äôt by an ocean. She believes that trash is only a problem in the ocean specifically. Screw the Ohio river, Lake Erie, and all the smaller lakes and creeks around. She only properly disposes of her trash when she vacations in Florida. 

TLDR litter doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre not by an ocean"
3527,"That‚Äôs the thing; I live within 15 minutes of a small city where there are a number of internet providers available. I‚Äôm too far away to benefit from those providers, yet too close that most companies just don‚Äôt care to branch out that little bit. Rural enough that many companies overlook us. Right along Lake Erie, the southernmost area in Ontario. I live within a 5 minute drive of the lake bank that is crumbling into the lake. There‚Äôs not much interest in this area."
3528,"Watson Lake and Granite Creek were added to the 2004 Water Quality Impaired Waters List
(303(d)). Watson Lake was listed for low DO, high pH, and nitrogen in excess of the Verde
Water Quality Standards; these listings have continued through subsequent assessments.
Although Granite Creek and Watson Lake have not been assessed as impaired for phosphorus,
based on subsequent data collection and lake response modeling, phosphorus reductions will
also be required to achieve target chlorophyll-a levels.

Why would anyone want to swim in there anyway? It's a man-made reservoir that is fed by Granite Creek. Everyone knows that Granite Creek is nasty because it passes through residential areas and a lot of human waste, along with cow/livestock waste gets emptied into it. The elevated amounts of nitrogen are mostly due to livestock waste (aka - cows) and of course fertilizers. Most of Arizona's creeks and waters have been destroyed due to ""open range"" as cows are nasty and dumb animals that urinate and defecate into their own food and water supply."
3529,"How did they do it in the 50s?  Simple, they polluted their way up and stole the rest.  No catalytic converters, Lake Erie tributaries caught on fire, strip mining, dumping of toxic wastes into rivers and oceans, smokestacks polluting the air that the cars didn't already pollute, raping of other countries natural resources.  Then we installed our own governments in Iran, Guatemala, etc., and raped their resources.  The cherry on top was making black Americans work but not being able to go to college.  That made everything cheap.  And there was no welfare: no public housing, no LBJs great society, no nothing.  Either you worked, or you kept a marriage intact, or you starved.

Eliminating all of that has immense costs that were borne by others and are now borne by you.  I think you want to eat your cake and have it too.  Be fucking proud of the fact that African Americans are in college.

Be proud of the fact that your air doesn't look like China like it used to.  Be proud of the fact that we have ~~free~~ fair trade coffee.  Be proud of the fact that you are able to pay for more of what you use and your suffering helps everyone else in the world except you.  That wasn't the case in 1950."

3531,"That article doesn't mention sinking. It refers only to flooding. 2019 was a record year for lake levels due to above average precipitation, record inflows from Lake Erie, and other unusual climactic factors that combined into a perfect storm, so to speak. It's also likely we will have record lows in the future, several great lakes had their record lows (Huron, Michigan) as recently as 2013. The extreme variations are being caused afaik by climate change."
3532,"Can't speak elsewhere, but Lake Erie doesn't catch on fire anymore, and our plant and light levels are actually going way up. Even when I was a kid in the 2000's it was much worse than it is now, you weren't even allowed to swim in a lot of places bc of literal flesh eating bacteria."
3533,"Generally, don't use Milorganite over and over, as eventually (over years) it'll cram your soil full of phosphorus, which does two things: first, it interferes with micronutrient uptake, and second, the phosphorus leaches from your soil and runs into your watershed, where it messes with the environment.  Excessive phosphorus use from agriculture and residential use literally killed Lake Erie in the 60's.  

Your lawn really doesn't need much P, so if you alternate an application of milorganite with fertilizers that contain no P you slow down the P buildup and slow down the environmental damage.

P in soil only moves about an inch or two a year, so once your soil has enough P, you shouldn't apply any at all (except maybe a light dash of starter when you're seeding to get some P immediately next to the seedlings).  If you overdo the P, that also means it takes a few years to get levels under control.  

If you want organic fertilizer, just use one with little to no phosphorus.  If you like the period of dark green from massive iron application like milorganite uses, use ironite or a synthetic with iron added, like Scott's Green Max.

I like milorganite, it's good fertilizer, but it isn't the best one to use on lawns if you've already got enough P."
3534,"Did these all end up in Lake Erie, Lake Ontario and the Canadian/New York countryside?"
3535,"We get ‚Äúfish fly‚Äù swarms near Lake Erie. They smell unsurprising fishy, and cause car accidents as the roads can get greasy slick with them!"
3536,"Lake Ontario is considered the most polluted out of the five Great Lakes. Although Lake Erie does have periods of build up where it is highly toxic due to its shallow nature. Lake Ontario has all of the other lakes flow into it, giving it their pollution. It also receives runoff from farms and businesses around it. 

Usually we advise that the  public should not swim during and after storms, floods, or heavy rainfall. Cloudy water can be an indicator of high levels of bacteria that may pose a risk to human health. Conditions are based upon E. coli counts in beach water samples taken over the past 24 hours. 

Although by certain standards set by the environment of Canada it is technically safe to swim during certain time‚Äôs but there is still bacteria in the water. There are always recommendations to not drink the water and shower after to ensure your body doesn‚Äôt absorb any bacteria.

So I‚Äôm not saying you can‚Äôt swim in there it‚Äôs more of 
why would you want to given the amount of health concerns. To each their own.

Perhaps I‚Äôm to close to the issues and see it from a different perspective. If I worked for a factory farm perhaps I wouldn‚Äôt eat factory farmed meat."
3537,"If I may comment, looking on beaches near the mouths of rivers and streams where they empty into the Great Lakes (I live closest to Lake Erie) tend to be good spots...before indoor plumbing, communities along the rivers and streams used them as trash dumps, or buried their waste and it eventually washed out over the decades from storms."
3538,"There is actually good reason for it. Dog poop contains tons of harmful microorganism. When it rains, that poop breaks down, in whole or in part, and washes into the local water systems. If it is just going into the sewers and gets immediately recycled through water purification plants, it isn't as harmful since those plants will do massive cleaning. However, if you live in an area that is a watershed (such as the Great Lakes area), then you end up draining all of those microorganisms into the local water. Not only can this harm the local wildlife, it can also hurt people who use the water systems.

So, why is it a problem for dogs and not other animals? It ultimately is about what they eat. Dog food tends to be very nutrient rich, which causes their poop to contain high amounts of certain elements, such as phosphorus, which can cause harmful algal blooms. In fact, it was because of fertilizer run-off that there were some extremely serious algal blooms in Lake Erie several years back, which caused many places to be unable to drink the water due to the toxins present. 

Wildlife doesn't have this problem though because they keep a closed system, for the most part. Deer eat things right in the environment and then return those nutrients to it. Dogs eat food from outside of the environment and then put nutrient dense poop into it.

As well, this generally applies to cat poop. It is not recommended that cats be allowed to poop outside if possible, one of the many reasons to not let the genocidal bird killers... I mean cute furry things, outside unsupervised. As well, cat poop also contains parasites (T. gondii) as well which, when in the body of an animal they can't complete their life cycle in (e.g. humans), become dangerous.

So, it really makes a lot of sense to not want our pets' poop to stay in yards. They are harmful to the environment and can be harmful to us."
3539,"Predictions made by climate scientists:

2017 - U.N. Climate Chief, Christiana Figueres, and three climate scientists, say that 2020 is the deadline to avert a Climate disaster.  If we haven't done something by then, then climate change is GOING TO DESTROY THE PLANET!


1989 - A Senior Environmental Officer at the U.N. (Noel Brown) said that ENTIRE NATIONS COULD BE WIPED OFF THE MAP unless Global Warming is reversed by the year 2000.   He claimed there would be coastal flooding and crop failures if we didn't act fast!



2004 - a secret Government report claims that Britain will be plunged into a Siberian Climate within 20 years.  It also claim major European cities will be plunged underwater.  And there would be NUCLEAR CONFLICT, FAMINE, MEGA-DROUGHTS, AND WIDESPREAD RIOTING, around the globe - unless action was taken on climate change.



2001 - Lonnie Thompson, a Geologist at Ohio University, said that by 2020 all the snow on Kilimanjaro will have disappeared - due to global warming.



1971 - NASA Scientist Dr I S Rasool, predicted a new ice age to start in 2021 - best buy some warm clothes!



1970 - Stanford's Dr Paul Ehrlich (Nobel Prize winning Biologist) said that by the end of the 70's, the oceans would be as dead as lake Erie.  He also said Americans would be subject to water rationing by 1974, and food rationing by 1980.

We terrorized one bus driver so bad about his poor driving skills that by the time we got to our school he just drove circles around the block and made us about an hour late for school. Being one of the main instigators, I had to get everyone to shut the fuck up because we lived fairly close to lake Erie, and all he would have to do to kill everyone on the bus is drive straight toward it and through a guard rail, off a 50 foot cliff... I had to hushedly explain to everyone that we might have broken him and were quite possibly in danger.  Alas, we lived and it was his first/last day as our driver.

This also happened in lake Erie from the farms that are now in the area that was once the Black Swamp. All the nutrients from that area in Ohio dump into lake Erie and the water gets so bad that they had to shut off the toronto city water once or twice."
3548,"""failure to treat the water properly""

That is correct. All water must be treated properly to be made safe for human consumption. DWSD provides water to a huge number of people in SE Michigan. Would you grab a glass of water out of the Detroit River? Lake Erie? I'd guess your answer, like mine, is ""no"". But DWSD does use water from both...but they treat it properly."

3550,"6) Balloonfest 1986, 1.5 million balloons..released in Cleveland...landed on lake Erie, not only polluting it, but the visual effect the balloons had on the water completely stalled out the search for two missing fishermen who had gone out that day. The balloons also caused multiple traffic accidents as they wafted thru traffic at such a large number that they blocked the view of drivers (and let's be honest people got distracted by that many balloons too) Oddly, the balloons also caused the injury to a few horses. 
Lesson...we really don't need helium balloons."
3551,Nothing like dipping your toes into the water and then looking to your left and seeing a giant raw sewage overflow pipe that drains directly into Lake Erie. So refreshing. I love nature.
3552,"I didn't read through your other comments, I just saw a few different people seemingly shocked that a lake could have powerful currents. I had a moment of realization that lots of people don't experience that kind of power from water aside from visits to the ocean over summer break. The great lakes are MASSIVE. They might as well be seas. I live next to lake Erie which is disgusting, but the rest of the lakes are only a few hours from here. I go camping at Huron in the summer. You can't see the other side."
3553,"A major issue in the midwest and great lakes region of North America is eutrophication, basically nutrient pollution into the water system. Destruction of wetlands, land conversion, cattle and fertilizer use all contribute to this issue and can cause complete loss of oxygen and death in the water column. Any community that relies on surface water for their drinking water has to deal with this as eutrophied waters have poisonous cyanotoxins in them. Agricultural pollution like this also has other serious issues,  E. coli and other coliform bacteria can even enter well supply and cause major issues like the [Walkerton outbreak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkerton_E._coli_outbreak) in the agricultural part of Ontario, killing six. Forest loss and field tilling also lead to increased sediment runoff too, which fills tributaries and eventually the endpoints of their rivers with this material, but also the toxic materials which are applied to the soil by people. Metal pollution can be perpetuated in this way. In these ways deforestation and wetlands destruction in Indiana can contribute to a hypoxic dead zone in the [Caribbean sea](https://www.epa.gov/ms-htf/hypoxia-101) or Lake Erie. Further, destruction of wetlands can reduce the buffering potential of watersheds against volume pulses during rain events. Dams become necessary to protect people living along these rivers from flood events (and they might want them for agricultural reasons as well), and obviously [dams can fail](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/michigan-dam-failures-evacuations-flooding-state-of-emergency/)."

I definitely agree people are much more conscious of the environment these days, much less litter, better environmental protections, but it certainly seems like overall the environment only gets worse. I just feel like I read every day about how we're hurtling towards extinction. I don't mean to disagree with you, I just have incredible anxiety about the earth dying, especially now that I'm pregnant."

3560,"I think it may depend on where you live.
Where your fresh water source is, and where treated sewage water goes.

If for example, your waste water was dumped in the ocean, then in a sense, you've wasted fresh (non-salt) water.  Especially if the area is experiencing a drought, and there is a limited supply of fresh water.


I live near Lake Erie.  Water treatment plants get fresh water from the lake, and waste water is returned to the lake.  In this case, I'd say I've wasted power &amp; resources ( treatment process), but not the actual water."

3567,"Trust me i got way more out of this experience than you did!  Ag in KSA has been a thorny issue--more than 4000 cubic kilometers of aquifer water were drained in the last generation in order to grow wheat (that's the equivalent of lake Erie.  It's a phenomenally huge amount of water).   IF you want to know more about that, look up ""Camels don't fly, Deserts don't bloom"" by Elie al Hadj.

3571,"Regardless of what the label says, very few weed killers dissipate at all.  Most are found in city water systems and sometimes city tap water from run off.  I started using a water filtration system years ago and now I can smell my tap water. (perfect example of ignorance is bliss).  Nobody is sitting down by Lake Erie and spraying round up in the water, yet it's there.  It's been linked to the huge algae bloom experienced over the years along with heavy fertilizers feeding it.  It's in the run off.  So the more weed killer that is sprayed, the more we drink and the more we eat.  It's the new side dish I guess. 

 Neonicotinoids are in the flowers and vegetable plants you buy at the store.  The growers use it and I've heard it can take 2 generations to remove it, which means you are eating that too. The pollinators would be transferring it from plant to plant also.  The best thing you can do for your vegetable garden is plant seeds."

3574,"The Montreal Protocol was implemented long before ozone depletion reached dangerous levels (imagine residents of certain cities being told they have to wear sunscreen for any duration of outdoor activity during some days).

Frankly if you look at the state of our environment in 1970, climate change just looks negligible. Lake Erie had been rendered lifeless while Southern California was choking on automobile exhaust fumes. In January, my Dad and I were driving along and nothing less than a Bald Eagle flew in front of the car. 50 years ago, our national bird was on the brink of extinction. The pesticide DDT was thinning its eggshells, so that when the mother bird went to incubate, she would break them. Now they're everywhere, they were recently spotted in Cape Cod for the first time in over a century."
3575,"Yeah all those farms are fucking up all our bodies of water. So much nutrient runoff that very few of our bodies of water are swimmable anymore. Ohio River is the most polluted river in the US.

3578,"It depends a lot on the conditions surrounding the body of water, what the glass looked like before it got into the water, and how long it stayed.  

Personally, I‚Äôve only ever searched for sea glass (We call it beach glass where I live) in Lake Erie, one of the Great Lakes in North America.  I‚Äôve found a few pieces similar to the shape in the picture above, but the majority of my pieces are the same as you stated- flat, some curved, many resembling pieces of bottles or plates.  This could be due to the fact that during the industrial era, many glass making companies dumped their glass into Lake Erie.  

It is possible that if many large chunks of glass were dumped into a body of water, over time they could form the pieces pictured above, but due to my past experience it makes me weary that so many pieces could be formed in such a similar fashion, especially with such rare colors.  That‚Äôs what leads me to believe these pieces have been tumbled.  But, there‚Äôs still the possibility that they were formed naturally, and I‚Äôm definitely no expert on the formation of beach glass.  

I hope this satisfies a bit of that question for you!  I‚Äôm sure others will have insight on it, too."
3579,"I'm surrounded on all sides by the largest supply of fresh water on the planet and if I don't pay my bill that supply is cut off. Forget that the supply is polluted and obtaining the water turns it into literal poison, if I stop payment I can't get it.

Flint was and remains an awful situation but then know that Statewide tests later confirmed it to somehow not be the worst water in the State (by county, to be fair).

Michigan laid all of it's water pipes in 1402. Made out of 100% lead, insulated by skunks and pox blankets, they then connected the entire system to the same water systems that would feed the World's automotive capital for 75 years.
Have you ever seen or smelled Zug Island? It looks like the apocalypse and smells like sulfur death. You know when you play Sim City and you have that part of town that holds ALL the pollution? Just ALL of it? And the map just shows a black or red spot to show how fucked it is?! That's Zug Island.
 It's the actual worst nightmare of the Natives we stole the land from. In their nightmares they couldn't have imagined a place as awful as Zug Island and it dumps it's waste into the same water source that a quarter of the State extracts it's water supply to drink, bathe and cook with.
Lake Erie alone has caught on fire multiple times. The Detroit River once went ablaze for something like 10 days in the 1990s. I grew up watching MASSIVE trash ships dumping it's contents just a few hundred yards off-shore. 

It's slightly better now but still not good. No bleach or ""cleaning tablets"" is making that shit potable but here we are paying for the poison...and I'm still aware of how much worse it is in much of the World.

That's the awful part! It's WORSE in much of the world. Like, most of it. Most humans alive right now would give all they have for access to the water I have access to because they don't have it at all or it's MUCH worse quality."
3580,"The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down
Of the big lake they called Gitche Gumee
The lake, it is said, never gives up her dead
When the skies of November turn gloomy
With a load of iron ore twenty-six thousand tons more
Than the Edmund Fitzgerald weighed empty
That good ship and true was a bone to be chewed
When the gales of November came early

The ship was the pride of the American side
Coming back from some mill in Wisconsin
As the big freighters go, it was bigger than most
With a crew and good captain well seasoned
Concluding some terms with a couple of steel firms
When they left fully loaded for Cleveland
And later that night when the ship's bell rang
Could it be the north wind they'd been feelin'?

The wind in the wires made a tattle-tale sound
And a wave broke over the railing
And every man knew, as the captain did too,
T'was the witch of November come stealin'
The dawn came late and the breakfast had to wait
When the gales of November came slashin'
When afternoon came it was freezin' rain
In the face of a hurricane west wind

When suppertime came, the old cook came on deck sayin'
Fellas, it's too rough to feed ya
At seven p.m., a main hatchway caved in, he said
Fellas, it's been good to know ya
The captain wired in he had water comin' in
And the good ship and crew was in peril
And later that night when 'is lights went outta sight
Came the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald

Does any one know where the love of God goes
When the waves turn the minutes to hours?
The searchers all say they'd have made Whitefish Bay
If they'd put fifteen more miles behind 'er
They might have split up or they might have capsized
They may have broke deep and took water
And all that remains is the faces and the names
Of the wives and the sons and the daughters

Lake Huron rolls, Superior sings
In the rooms of her ice-water mansion
Old Michigan steams like a young man's dreams
The islands and bays are for sportsmen
And farther below Lake Ontario
Takes in what Lake Erie can send her
And the iron boats go as the mariners all know
With the gales of November remembered

In a musty old hall in Detroit they prayed,
In the maritime sailors' cathedral
The church bell chimed till it rang twenty-nine times
For each man on the Edmund Fitzgerald
The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down
Of the big lake they called Gitche Gumee
Superior, they said, never gives up her dead
When the gales of November come early"
3581,It allows them to over fish them even more and potentially collapse the stock. Pretty short sighted if you ask me. Over here in Lake Erie we had really strict restrictions on walleye for many years now the population has rebounded tremendously and guess what? they relaxed the restrictions to reduce the population. It‚Äôs an ebb and flow thing. But if you over fish and collapse the population it can take decades to rebound.

3587,"Absolutely.  There are several examples in the Great Lakes.  

The red-tailed leafhopper is a rare hemipteran found in small populations in tallgrass prairie ecosystems in the midwest, but there is a thriving relict population of the insect on Manitoulin Island in Lake Superior (where there is no longer any tallgrass prairie).  They got stranded on the island as biomes shifted, but adapted on the island to different food sources.

There are caribou on Isolated Slate Island in northern Lake Superior, while on the mainland they have generally all migrated up to the arctic, creating an isolated island population.

Most of the unique, endemic species to the Great Lakes islands are plants, which I have to admit I'm not so familiar with.  Pitcher's thistle, lakeside daisy, and dwarf lake iris are examples of flowers found only on certain islands in the Great Lakes.  There's also a snake, the Lake Erie watersnake (a subspecies of common watersnake) found on only a few islands in western Lake Erie."

3591,"A school district in Beverly Hills, California, was saddled with a bill of at least $11 million to plug 19 oil wells on the property of its high school, after a judge in 2017 absolved Venoco LLC - the bankrupt company that had been operating the wells - of any responsibility for clean-up because other creditors took priority. The city of Beverly Hills is contributing another $11 million to the job.

‚ÄúThis is an incredible amount of money‚Äù siphoned away from education, said Michael Bregy, superintendent of the Beverly Hills Unified School District.

State and federal regulations normally require drillers to pay an up-front bond to cover future cleanups if they go belly-up. But the rules are a patchwork, with wildly differing requirements, and they seldom leave governments adequately funded. In Pennsylvania, for example, it would take several thousand years to plug its estimated backlog of 200,000 abandoned oil wells at the current rate of spending, according to data from the state regulator.

Oil-industry lobbyists have been fighting state and federal efforts to increase the bonding, arguing it would hurt jobs and economic growth during an already tough time for the industry.

‚ÄúStates and the federal government have many sources of funding available to reclaim and plug abandoned wells,‚Äù said Reid Porter, a spokesman for the American Petroleum Institute, the country‚Äôs largest oil and gas trade group.
The API spent $1.44 million in the first quarter of 2020 lobbying on Capitol Hill, with oil well bonding legislation one of the target issues, lobbying disclosures show.

The U.S. Government Accountability Office estimates that cleaning up and plugging an abandoned well runs from $20,000 to $145,000, **putting the price tag for cleaning up all of America‚Äôs abandoned wells somewhere between $60 billion to $435 billion.**

#‚ÄòSHOOTING OUT OF THE EARTH‚Äô

**The pollution threat goes beyond climate change. Leaks from abandoned wells have been found to contaminate groundwater and soil. In extreme cases, gas from abandoned wells has caused explosions.**

In Ohio and Texas, state regulators have each found an average of around two groundwater contamination incidents per year related to orphaned wells, according to research by the Groundwater Protection Council published in 2011 and dating to the 1980s.

In April 2017, for example, neighbors of Ohio farmer Stan Brenneman alerted him to the smell of oil coming from a drainage ditch on his 111-acre corn and soybean farm near the town of Elida, Brenneman told Reuters. The ditch drains water from the farm and carries it into rivers, streams and eventually Lake Erie.

Ohio‚Äôs Division of Oil &amp; Gas Resources Management excavated 800 feet of the farm‚Äôs drainage system to find a well casing - about 130 years old - releasing oil three feet underground. The plugging operation took two months to complete and cost the state $196,915, according to a spokeswoman for the state Department of Natural Resources.

More recently, in 2018, the U.S. EPA was alerted to the presence of nearly 50 abandoned oil and gas wells on Navajo Nation lands within the borders of Utah and New Mexico that were bubbling water at the surface. Tests showed the way from some of the wells contained potentially dangerous levels of arsenic, sulfate, benzene and chloride.

The Navajo Nation Environmental Protection Agency said plugging the wells would require ‚Äúmajor funds‚Äù and that, in the meantime, the public had been warned not to drink the water.

In rare cases, gas from long-abandoned wells can cause dangerous accidents.

In January of last year, a 1930s-era well sent a geyser of gas and dirt 100 feet into the air at the construction site of a Marriott seaside hotel in Marina del Rey, California, an upscale community in the Los Angeles area, according to a state report. The hotel owners did not respond to a request for comment.

‚ÄúIt was horrifying,‚Äù said resident Marilyn Wall, who witnessed the explosion from her home across the street. She said she was stunned ‚Äúby the extent and the length of time that the stuff was shooting out of the earth.‚Äù

A worker standing on a construction platform above the plume was sprayed with debris and scrambled to lower himself down with an escape rope, a video of the explosion shows.

#DON‚ÄôT DRINK THE WATER

For Hanson and Michael Rowe, their troubles did not end the day their abandoned well was plugged. They no longer drink from the water well on their property because it gives them diarrhea, they said. Michael Rowe said she still suffers from headaches and coughing spells.

Kentucky‚Äôs Energy and Environment Cabinet is still fighting to recoup the $383,340 cost from the now-defunct J.D. Carty and Blue Energy in an ongoing court battle.

An attorney for John Carty, founder of J.D. Carty, said his client had sold what few assets remained in the company and therefore bore no responsibility. A lawyer for Blue Energy said the company denies ever operating the wells on the property and has no responsibility to maintain or plug them.

J.D. Carty was only required to have one $50,000 ‚Äúblanket bond‚Äù to cover all its wells in Kentucky. The amount forfeited to pay for the leaky well on Rowe‚Äôs land, determined in part by its depth, was just $2,500 - less than 1% of the cost to fix it.

After the incident, Kentucky lawmakers passed a bill last year that effectively doubled bond requirements for shallow wells to help cope with the state‚Äôs 13,000 abandoned wells. Still, state regulators say the list of wells is growing.

Hanson Rowe said he supports fossil fuel development because using natural gas for heat and cooking has improved his quality of life. But the couple say they hope their lawsuit against the companies involved will help change the way the energy industry manages its wells.

‚ÄúYou lost your health, you‚Äôve lost it all,‚Äù Hanson Rowe said.

&gt;The threat to avian wildlife from nuclear power plants can be divided into upstream and downstream fatalities.
&gt;
&gt;Upstream, uranium milling and mining can poison and kill hundreds of birds per facility per year. Abandoned open pit uranium mines in Wyoming have formed lakes hazardous to wildlife. Uranium-bearing formations are usually associated with strata containing high concentrations of selenium. For example, one of these pits killed 300 birds during a single year (US Fish and Wildlife Service 2008). Presuming this rate stayed constant, deaths at this mine therefore correlate to about 0.45 deaths per GWh.
&gt;
&gt;Like fossil-fueled power stations and wind farms, avian fauna can also collide with nuclear power plants. Three thousand birds died in two successive nights in 1982 from collisions with cooling towers at Florida Power Corporation‚Äôs Crystal River Generating Facility (Maehr et al. 1983). Given that the power plant now hosts an 838-MW nuclear reactor, and presuming it operated with a capacity factor of 90% and that the 3000 deaths were the only ones throughout the year, the facility was responsible for 0.454 avian deaths per GWh. Ornithologists observed 274 fatal bird collisions with an elevated cooling tower at the Limerick nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania from 1979 to 1980 (Veltri and Klem 2005). Since the Limerick plant has a 1200-MW reactor, and also assuming it operated at a 90% capacity factor, it was responsible for 0.261 deaths per GWh. At the Susquehanna plant in eastern Pennsylvania, 1500 dead birds were collected between 1978 and 1986 for an average of 187 fatalities per year (Biewald 2005). Assuming that the 2200 MW plant operated at 90% capacity factor, it was responsible for 0.01 deaths per GWh. Extensive surveys for dead birds were also conducted at the Davis-Bess nuclear plant near Lake Erie in Northern Ohio. Ornithologists recorded a total of 1554 bird fatalities or an average of 196 per year from 1972 to 1979 (Biewald 2005). Given that the power plant hosts an 873-MW reactor, and assuming it operated with a 90% capacity factor, and the plant was responsible for 0.0285 fatalities per GWh. Taking the mean for each of the four power plants results in 0.188 deaths per GWh. 
&gt;
&gt;The total avian deaths per GWh for nuclear power plants are therefore about 0.638."
3595,"Sounds amazing, I've got a few suggestions around Hamilton to Erie. You probably already know this, but here's a map of the ""great trail"", the trans canada trail that's good for biking:

 [https://thegreattrail.ca/explore-the-map/](https://thegreattrail.ca/explore-the-map/) 

I'd recommend the Hamilton Brantford rail trail, as that's what I've done a lot. Really nice gravel trail that's away from busy roads. It'll take you to Brantford, or further to Paris. North of Paris is Ayr, which has Willibald distillery. Or you can turn south and follow the trans Canada trail to Port Dover, or anywhere west of that.

In Hamilton there are two great breweries on that trail, Grain and Grit, and Fairweather.

A bit off that trail in Ancaster is Blackbird brewery. I haven't gone yet, not sure if it's open right now. Shaun and Ed brewing is in Dundas, I've heard good things about them too.

Railway brewing in St Thomas is great. Port Stanley just south of that is a cool town.

If you head east along the escarpment there are a ton of wineries and breweries all the way from Hamilton to Niagara. You could head there and then loop back west along lake Erie depending on how far you want to bike. Biking out Ridge Road from Hamilton is pretty special. And it follows the Bruce trail, so there's probably a bunch of places to camp.

The row of buildings where he lived was nice but thet abruptly stopped and there was a sizeable stretch of undeveloped land and a little side channel that looked out of place. Turns out the original developer had used explosives to blast out the channels and one day blasted a bunch of rock that ended up severely damaging some nearby houses and injuring some residents. The lawsuits bankrupted the company so over half the land that was supposed to be developed never was.

So, there may be other sources of mercury, but the main ones are hundreds of tons of mercury being used to process ore, and do something with wood pulp, then getting rinsed off wholesale, without even settling, into the watershed.

Keep in mind algae is a very broad term that refers to wide variety of fresh and salt water organisms.

OP likely meant phytoplankton, which are an algae, and are negatively impacted by acidification.

Phytoplankton have calcium shells, which break down as acidity goes up, as well as produce a large portion (approx 50%) of oxygen on the planet through photosynthesis.

Phytoplankton are at the very base of the food web and preventing a collapse is crucial for the survival of humanity.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algal_bloom

&gt;The term ""algal bloom"" is defined inconsistently depending on the scientific field and can range between a ""minibloom"" of harmless algae to a large, harmful bloom event.[4] Since 'algae' is a broad term including organisms of widely varying sizes, growth rates, and nutrient requirements, there is no officially recognized threshold level as to what is defined as a bloom. 

&gt;Blooms are the result of a nutrient that the particular algae need being introduced to the local aquatic system. This growth-limiting nutrient is typically nitrogen or phosphorus, but can also be iron, vitamins, or amino acids.[3] There are several mechanisms for the addition of these nutrients in water. In the open ocean and along coastlines, upwelling from both winds and topographical ocean floor features can draw nutrients to the photic, or sunlit zone of the ocean.[10] Along coastal regions and in freshwater systems, agricultural, city, and sewage runoff can cause algal blooms.[11] Two examples of anthropogenic algal blooms in the United States are in Lake Erie and the Gulf of Mexico.[12]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plankton

&gt; Phytoplankton absorb energy from the Sun and nutrients from the water to produce their own nourishment or energy. In the process of photosynthesis, phytoplankton release molecular oxygen (O
2) into the water as a waste byproduct. It is estimated that about 50% of the world's oxygen is produced via phytoplankton photosynthesis.[30] The rest is produced via photosynthesis on land by plants.[30] Furthermore, phytoplankton photosynthesis has controlled the atmospheric CO
2/O2 balance since the early Precambrian Eon.[31]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytoplankton

&gt;The effects of anthropogenic ocean acidification on phytoplankton growth and community structure has also received considerable attention. Phytoplankton such as coccolithophores contain calcium carbonate cell walls that are sensitive to ocean acidification. Because of their short generation times, evidence suggests some phytoplankton can adapt to changes in pH induced by increased carbon dioxide on rapid time-scales (months to years)"

&gt; Every year, an explosion of microscopic life reigns over western Lake Erie, forming a green slick of algae and bacteria so massive and vibrant that it can be seen from space.

&gt; [...] In 2014, it left 400,000 people without drinking water for three days after toxins infiltrated Toledo‚Äôs water system. 

&gt; [...] At its peak, it coated around 620 square miles of Lake Erie‚Äôs surface waters, an area more than twice the size of Chicago, according to satellite imagery. The sheer weight of blue-green bacteria making up the bloom ‚Äî forecast to be around 46,000 metric tons ‚Äî was expected to be a new record.

Lake Erie, despite being the shallowest and amongst the least in terms of volume, it provides the most drinking water out of the Great Lakes.

Why it's worse for Lake Erie than the other Great Lakes:

&gt; The danger is most acute in Lake Erie ‚Äî the shallowest, southernmost and warmest of the Great Lakes ‚Äî which is a natural incubator for these colonies of microorganisms. 

It's so dangerous that some dogs have died from it. I wouldn't encourage people to take their dogs into the lake if they're along Lake Erie aswell or any other lakes that have intense algae blooms."

Most of the lake Erie tribs in PA and NY are put and take.

3675,"Global warming is actually the reason behind record breaking snowfalls in some areas of the globe.

For example, I live in Buffalo, which is a city prone to lake effect snow storms. The storms come in from Lake Erie. Usually, snow tends to slow down in January/February because the lake is at least partially frozen over and it becomes harder for lake effect storms to pick up steam as they cross the lake. 

However, it‚Äôs been over five years (probably more I haven‚Äôt been counting) since the lake has even partially frozen over.  Which means that despite overall warmer winters, Buffalo is getting MORE snow than we usually do. Our average annual snowfall is about 90 inches but last winter we blew that out of the water. 

[This article doesn‚Äôt go into the causes,](https://weather.com/safety/winter/news/2019-02-19-buffalo-new-york-100-inches-of-snow-winter-2018-2019) but it talks about buffalos increased snowfall over the past few years."

3680,"You're right hooker chemical wasn't nuclear waste. Arguably worse, as you mentioned there were less regulations.

Lots of stuff goes to the toxic waste dump. But there are radioactive hot spots all over the county. Parts of the Manhattan project went to the dump.

Lots of nasty stuff that wreaks havoc on people, especially prolonged exposure. Hooker chemical used to have outlet pipes to the Niagara river (north of the falls where it lets out into lake Ontario) and the water was awful. That kind of dumping temporarily made lake Erie officially a dead lake. The zebra muscles actually helped clean the water a lot, after they were forced to stop dumping of course, but the sediment is still filthy. There are always warnings about going to lake beaches after storms. You're limited to eating one fish a month from the lake if I remember correctly, pregnant women have been warned to never eat lake fish.

Used to get an ear infection if you put your head under the water, according to the guy that taught me almost everything I know about sailing. He was related to the guy that owned hooker chemical, same last name. Grew up during the dumping. Sailing and swimming in that water since the late 50s, when he first started sailing.

So you're right that it's absolutely not *all* radioactive material. There's a lot of terrible shit. But there's absolutely nuclear waste in the dump. And spots that set off monitors all over, I'll try to find a video someone did with a news article about it. It was years ago, can't remember if it was buffalo news or not."
3681,"&gt; you cant pollute without paying the price

To whom to pay price?

Consider what would happen if private firms were able to own the rivers and the lakes. If a private firm owned Lake Erie, for example, then anyone dumping garbage in the lake would be promptly sued in the courts for their aggression against private property and would be forced by the courts to pay damages and to cease and desist from any further aggression. Thus, only private property rights will insure an end to pollution ‚Äî invasion of resources.

As factories began to arise and emit smoke, blighting the orchards of neighboring farmers, the farmers would take the manufacturers to court, asking for damages and injunctions against further invasion of their property. But the judges said, in effect, ""Sorry. We know that industrial smoke (i.e., air pollution) invades and interferes with your property rights. But there is something more important than mere property rights: and that is public policy, the 'common good.' And the common good decrees that industry is a good thing, industrial progress is a good thing, and therefore your mere private property rights must be overridden on behalf of the general welfare.""

I live near Lake Erie and we have had some issues with inconsiderate dog owners. One of the beaches is designated for people to bring their dogs but they need to be on a leash and the owners need to clean up after them. Unfortunately there was a problem with people bringing them to one of the beaches used by families with younger kids since the wave action is far mellower on that beach and there is more shade. There started to be an issue with shit being left on the beach so they ended the dog beach thing because nobody wanted to contend with dogs shitting on the beach where the kids were playing or dogs off leash barking/growling at people.

I've seen some people still bringing them into the park on the bay side so when I swim I stick to the open water part of the park where nobody brings kids or dogs. If there is shit in the water at least the wave action is enough to keep it seriously diluted.

There was also a problem a couple of years ago with dogs digging up the nests of the endangered piping plovers nesting by the lake and breaking their eggs. People got rightfully worked up about that. It was dog lovers vs. bird lovers and got pretty ugly."

My first conclusion is climate change but maybe someone has a better explanation. I can post before and after pictures."
3700,This year we had significant rains on all the great lakes. I live a stones throw from Lake Erie so I see it every day. Summer of 2018 our beach had maybe 20-25ft of sand/rock to walk on until you reached the water and this year we had maybe 3ft tops. I visited Manitoulin this past summer and docks there were under a foot of water and people were still using them to tie off and disembark. I think back in November (sometime in the fall) we had warnings of 3+ meter storm surges. The park near me overlooking the lake is maybe a 15-20ft hill + breakwall to the water. We had entire railroad ties lifted into the road \~50ft back from the edge of the breakwall. After that storm I went to the beach to look for treasure and the entire road was underneath a foot or more of sand and debris. There were entire decks washed up and I saw the support for a large shed roof there too.

It's just that ""pollution"" in general has been downplayed in place of much more vague fears of ""climate change"", for reasons I don't know why (I even heard some youngster scoff at 1970s anti-pollution campaigns for not dealing with ""climate change"", I found it \_very\_ bizarre ... and then he went and called the famous ""crying Indian"" racist ... meanwhile, that guy probably did more for the enviroment than Greta did  .. that commercial knew how to lay a guilt trip the right way ..) .. probably because people can do something about pollution, but it costs industry money, whereas the common man can be carbon-taxed ....

(personal anectode incoming)

But I digress.  I grew up in the Windsor-Detroit area of the 1970s and 80s, when Lake Erie was biologically dead and we weren't allowed to swim in it at my great-aunt's cottage (the beach was no fun, either, it's hard to describe how disgusting it was.  We were actually better off playing in the swamp with the snakes and bullfrogs.)   Lots of air pollution as well as water pollution, as there was SO much industry going on back then.  But no one felt the need to wear masks ... maybe we should have done.  By the 1990s, I was a smoker, and had a group of roleplaying buddies.  At our busiest game, you could see eight people around a big table, 8 2L bottles of Coke, and 7 asthma inhalers (and one pack of smokes, but I took it outside, of course.)  All my friends were actually from out of town, and didn't develop asthma until they moved to Windsor.  Go figure.  (I've quit smoking.  My lungs collapsed while I was being operated on for a holey gut, and they said my lungs were basically utter garbage.  Two weeks on a breather cleaned 'em up real good, though, and a month in the hospital was a great start on The Patch, so I was able to quit, finally.  I also left that polluted shit-hole 20 years ago, and that solved a chronic migraine problem on its own ...)

There's an annual dead zone in the gulf of Mexico every year resulting from nitrogen runoff following down the Mississippi.

There is no doubt that nationwide cleanup measures, educational programs, and laws need to be put in place to help deal with the vast footprint we make.

Coal is devastating.  I have a friend who used to work on a ship that delivered coal to Nanticoke on Lake Erie.  They would burn two full cargo ships worth of coal per day so it was a 24/7 operation shipping it from Ohio.  An entire mountain of coal would go into the air every day and whenever the wind was from the south west that plume went straight over Toronto.  I don't know if you remember all the smog days Toronto used to have in the 2000s  and how bad the air felt to breath but it was all from that plant.  But since they restarted Bruce A, we shut down Nanticoke and replaced coal with nuclear and Toronto hasn't had a smog day since."

3724,"Western New York near Buffalo, right by Lake Erie which is exactly what I'd like to bring up. The lake was at 36¬∞F today (February 4th) which ties the record for daily temperature. Another alarming note about the lake is as of a few days ago, there was ice coverage totalling 0%. It is getting into mid-winter (or what should/used to be the middle of it) and I can't think of a time in my life that there was a ZERO for the amount of ice coverage. If anything it should be &gt;70% covered, and it wouldn't be abnormal to have it as high as 90%+ (If I can find a current estimate for ice coverage I'll edit this, haven't seen any measurement since this past Friday morning) Either last winter (2019) or the winter prior (2018) the lake was 100% frozen around now, give or take a couple weeks.

If a cold burst of air ever ends up coming through, coupled with winds out of the southwest, we are going to get HAMMERED with lake effect snow. Because Erie is wide open without any ice, there will be nothing to prevent the moisture from being absorbed from the surface. I'm interested to see if this pattern of freeze&gt;thaw&gt;freeze breaks and we get any ""normal"" winter weather, which would mean the snow on the ground lasts longer than 3 or 4 days. Our yearly snowfall average is 95""/241cm which we have currently a total of only 40""/~100cm. We usually don't really see much significant snowfall after March, though snow in April, May and even the beginning of June wouldn't be impossible.

There are Canadian Geese around here, I don't know when they arrived or where they came from, shit they probably didn't ever leave in the first place. There are squirrels out running around. 

I am very grateful that this is all lies and fake news though, and some kind of communist conspiracy or something to collapse the US with climate hysteria like my father seems to believe.

I can remember in the 60s and 70s, the lake freezing over nearly every winter with people seeing who could be the first to walk across the lake over to Canada.  Dangerous, to be sure, but possible, and many did so.  Then in the late 70s, the lake began to freeze solid less often.  It makes me so sad to hear the winter, if you can call it that, that you are having this year.  Buffalo always had more snow than anyone along those lakes, except maybe for Oswego (different lake).  Lake effect blizzards in March may be a real thing for you this year, but the loss of snow to fill aquifers is also concerning.  And, I would also imagine that the roads are going to be terribly broken up by late spring if you have a quick freeze and thaw with no snowpack."

It also has really fertile soil - we're called the Nursery Capital of the World (not sure how that designation came to be!), and Mentor has a garden dedicated to it being the Rose Capital of the world for a while (https://mentorchamber.org/resources-visitors/city-of-mentor/). Grand River is a key ecosystem for freshwater mussels in northeast Ohio - since the Zebra Mussels took over lake Erie and outcompeted so many of the diverse native species, the Grand River is now home to these populations.

If I had to pick one of these things as iconic for the county, I think I'd pic Fairport Harbor (if pic is most important) or Headlands Beach (if pic is less important)."

3741,"Being a resident of a Great Lakes state and fly fisherman  -We have potamodromous runs of steelhead (O. mykiss), lake run browns(S. trutta), Atlantic salmon (S. salar), and rare populations of Coaster brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis). 

Steelhead in the GL are non- native and were introduced in 1876 from McCloud River California steelhead and released into the Au Sable River. Several strains of mykiss have since been introduced and Little Manistee strain steelhead have been introduced into Lake Erie tribs ( Steelhead Alley)

Brown Trout in the GL are non native as well and were brought over from German brood stock in 1883 and released into the Baldwin River in 1884. Several different strains of brown trout have since been introduced. 

Atlantic Salmon and Brook trout are native GL species, although the Atlantics were nearly completely wiped out by overfishing snd habitat loss/pollution Reintroduced in The St Mary‚Äôs River in the early 1980s and planted in several other rivers in the last 5-7 years and are doing well.

3742,"So much flooding last year here in the Windsor-Essex caused by high water levels in Lake Erie and the Detroit River. And it just stayed too, barely receded until the late summer and is still way higher than this time last year."
3743,"Northerner along the great lakes checking in here. Humidity exists all year round. In the summer it's brutal. 

In the winter, the humidity can be bad and make it seem more cold than it really is. It's just above freezing at 34¬∞ but with humidity and wind it feels like 25¬∞.

In the winter, given the right conditions along Lake Erie (the most notable for lake effect snow), will result in lake effect snow. And one of those criteria? Good, upper atmosphere humidity and a good temperature variation between the lake and the atmosphere, which is entirely possible for a big lake of water up North in the winter.

The really sad part is climate change. After my city made the front page a few years ago for how much snow we get, we're now on par for a low snowfall year, and potentially a record low in ice extent along Lake Erie.

Only two other years since 1973 have had less in ice extent. I hope I turn out to be wrong, but as it stands it's at ~2.5% ice extent and was projected by NOAA to be at 80% by late February."
3744,"We used to live in Akron, OH where the St Lawrence divide goes through. The divide is what turns the Cuyahoga River northward so it empties into Lake Erie.

3753,"I like right by Lake Erie, and went there several times as a kid and adult. its actually fairly similar when your just looking at it from afar. I was amazed by the strength of the ocean currents and how much cleaner it looked than the lake and the taste of the salt."
3754,"That's because Lake Michigan is much better than Lake Erie. Lake Erie has no sand, so the ""beach"" is either rocky, muddy, or they bring in sand so the beach is very small. Lake Erie is also pretty dirty by comparison."
3755,"Part of why Michigan is beautiful and looks clean is the invasive mussels. They filter the water well but are bad for other wildlife and ultimately bad for the fish population. As someone who lives on Lake Erie, I am eternally jealous of how clear that lake is so I looked it up at one point! Kinda a mix of good and bad since it's obviously nice to swim in a clear lake but who knows what damage it will cause long term."

3757,"I grew up in Michigan. I have my stuck my feet in every Great Lake. Seeing the ocean for the first time wasn't a huge deal, since I've been surrounded by water for 30+ years. Being *in* the ocean was a different story. Lake Erie just doesn't get waves like that. Plus it's so dirty and prone to [toxic algae](https://greatlakes.org/campaigns/lake-erie-algae-blooms/). Lake Michigan gets some nice waves, though! And the water appears clean. The beaches are in better shape too. I haven't swam in Lake Huron or Lake Superior. The last time I visited them I was 10 and it was March. It's hard to imagine not being close to so much water."

3759,"It's been weird in NE Ohio as well. It only recently really started snowing, and even then it's usually much colder right now. I think thee first snowfall that actually stuck was some time in early January which is a first for me. There's been lots of rain too, but never ice on the ground. Lake Erie is supposed to be 80% ice covered by now as well. As of late January, it was 2%, and it hasn't changed much since."
3760,"I don't really think chemical pollutants is really that much of a problem when it comes to the environmental health of Lake Erie, Lake Ontario and the Niagara river today. I mean, chemical contamination is still a major concern for this region, but as far as I know, it's not really new chemical pollutants being released that are the major problem of concern (since the DEC/EPA tightly regulate that and the various environmental watch dogs like the Waterkeeper and WNY Land Conservancy).

The main issues with chemical pollutants are the hot spots where toxic chemicals were released in the past (before regulations) and have been slowly been getting released into the water systems through leechate. I am talking about spots like the Buffalo River and parts of the Niagara River, Lake Ontario and Erie where the toxic chemicals are buried beneath the silt/soil layers deep down at the bottom of the waterways. The only way to really get that stuff removed is by dredging, sealing it with a clay liner or using certain plant species to absorb the waste.

Either way, I am all for the city of Buffalo to really step it up more than just the new Green Code and implement a multi-prong system for cleaning out the waterways by adding stuff to the city like these storm drain system catch nets, the trash water wheels and consistent litter clean up efforts. Anything is better than nothing."
3761,It looks just like Lake Erie but smells even worse.
3762,"I agree with you, man I did underplay how big of a problem fluid run off from automobiles and other machines really is. It sucks how close all the major thruways and roads around here are to the water bodies. The I-190 and Route five are direct points of contact for that shit. If the city of Buffalo or the state were to ever invest in garbage catch nets, maybe they can move on to redesigning the city's sewer system. Maybe even designing little catch basins before the water hits the lake or the river, like little bonds or lagoons with certain filter plants. Niagara Falls needs it bad too, everyone knows about the how all that backup waste was dumped into the lower Niagara River, right below the American falls 3 summers ago.  

You can add fertilizer run off from farms to that too, that's where the algae bloom on Lake Erie is coming from. At least New York isn't significantly contributing to it in a way like how Ohio has."

The Peninsula Wasteland, the broken shell of America's greatest industrial zone.  Home of Corvega, RobCo, General Atomics, and a dozen other major manufacturers.  Now, the irradiated ashes and rubble hold the mutated and the maddened.  The Great Lakes glow from beneath with radioisotopes as the surface burns from spilled chemicals and ""trashbergs.""  It is a city where ""business as usual"" has taken a turn for the violently surreal.

Raider gangs vie for control of towering megascrapers.  Some throw glam rock warpaint on their armor and incorporate flamethrowers into the necks of their electric guitars.  Others hold gladiatorial hockey games, their sticks razor sharp and coarsely wrapped in barbed wire, their pads spiked.  Some fancy themselves the inheritors of the great manufacturers of the past, post-apocalyptic executives blasted on every chem combination imaginable as they make insane wagers on the outcome of vehicular death races.  Those who are trying to make a more pleasant living think R&amp;B means ""rockets and bombs.""  A revered music hall becomes a war zone as raiders and settlements engage in ""Battle of the Bands,"" equal parts musical performance and firefight.

Feral ""Yooper"" ghouls wander down from the Upper Peninsula in horrendous waves.  Teams of Mounties probe from a forward base in Windsor in scarlet-painted power armor, surviving on radroach poutine and praying they will not need to send for reinforcements from Toronto should the worst befall them.  Robots on automated vehicle assembly lines agitate for better working conditions while super mutants in Corvega's flagship plant attempt to build war wagons with human slave labor.  The enigmatic assassins of the House of Wax mumble half-forgotten song titles amongst each other in a strange cant before striking out against targets from their headquarters in an antique record store.  A bizarre cult worships an abominable deity, Khalahmhari, which bears a more-than-passing resemblance to the mutated octopi which have survived the Great War in the irradiated waters of Lake Erie.

3765,"I live on Lake Erie and the shit I witness here at the public launch in cleveland is astounding. Especially in the spring. I used to just hang out down there with a six pack and a fishing pole and watch. 

Worst one I saw was some guys who bought a big ass cabin cruiser off craigslist. One with the roller trailer. They had never been boating before. Watched them unhook the boat from the trailer and back down the ramp. They got half way down and the thing just rolled right off and slammed onto the concrete. Took about 10 of us to push the thing in. Any sane person would have put the boat right back on the trailer and pulled it out. Not these guys, they fucking parked the truck and took the boat out on the lake for the day, without check to see if their Fiberglass hull had cracked.

We've abandoned our allies to the slaughter. We have made zero progress on the nuclear programs of Iran or North Korea (and have probably regressed). Russia continues to meddle in our elections. The economy is the result of Obama's policies, Trump is just riding the coattails (and the economy has slowed since 2016 by several measures). The air and water are more polluted than they've been in years, including the red tide off of Florida's coasts and the algae in Lake Erie. Climate change continues unabated, and our president promotes the myth that it's a Chinese hoax while hurricanes pummel our shores, forest fires continue to rage, and we have floods to the extent that our farmers can't plant OR harvest.

I also don't like him starting fights with Gold Star families or disrespecting John McCain by saying he's not a war hero because he was captured. I don't like him accepting a purple heart from a combat wounded veteran with the words ""I always wanted one of these, this was easier."" I don't like the fact that he dodged the draft. I don't like that he is such a petty little man that he creates insulting nicknames for his adversaries like a five-year-old child. I don't like that he has disallowed members of his staff from testifying before Congress.

That‚Äôs the gist of it anyway. I think I said before that I‚Äôm for research but a lot of what‚Äôs being said in these threads strikes me hard as propagandistic talking points. That might sound paranoid to you but I know for a fact that DTE, the for profit energy corporation who operates a nuclear power plant on the shores of Lake Erie, pays people to comment in forums like this. They push their agenda. So you‚Äôll have to excuse me if I don‚Äôt trust a bunch of talking points from strangers on the internet who act like they‚Äôre all operating in concert.

3779,"I'm a lifelong resident of South Bruce and it would be absolutely unsuitable to bury the waste here. It is flawed logic to assume that because it is the best available technology, it is 100% safe, reliable and effective. There is no guarantee the waste will remain as intended for 100 000 years. The absurdly long time frame makes any speculation wildly unpredictable. For scale, in half that time Niagara Falls will no longer exist, having eroded all the way to Lake Erie. Enough risk remains that this project should be removed from human population, fertile land and sources of fresh water."

The stadium, it is said, never gives up her dead

When the skies of November turn gloomy

With a crowd of Fans Hundred-Seven thousand tons more

Than the Big House weighed empty

That good team and true was a bone to be chewed

When the gales of November came early

The team was the pride of the Michigan side

Coming back from some mill in Madison

As the big Stadiums go, it was bigger than most

With players and coach well seasoned

Concluding some terms with a couple of B1G firms

When they left fully loaded for Columbus

And later that night when the team's bell rang

Could it be the north wind they'd been feelin'?

The wind in the wires made a tattle-tale sound

And a wave broke over the railing

And every player knew, as the coach did too,

T'was the witch of November come stealin'

The dawn came late and the breakfast had to wait

When the gales of November came slashin'

When afternoon came it was freezin' rain

In the face of a hurricane west wind

When game time came, the Ncaa came on field sayin'

Fellas, it's too much cream cheese to feed ya

At twelve p.m., a main coverage caved in, he said

Fellas, it's been good to know ya

The coach wired in he had buckeyes comin' in

And the good stadium and team was in peril

And later that night when 'is lights went outta sight

Came the wreck of the Big House

When the waves turn the minutes to hours?

The searchers all say they'd have made Indianapolis

If they'd put fifteen more points behind 'er

They might have split up or they might have capsized

They may have broke deep and took water

And all that remains is the faces and the names

Of the fans and the students and the Alumni

Lake Huron rolls, Superior sings

In the rooms of her ice-water mansion

Old Michigan steams like a young man's dreams

The islands and bays are for sportsmen

And farther below Lake Ontario

Takes in what Lake Erie can send her

And the football teams go as the talking heads all know

With the gales of November remembered

In a musty old hall in Detroit they prayed,

In the maritime players' cathedral

The church bell chimed till it rang fifteen times

For each loss of the last 16

The legend lives on from the Detroit on down

Of the big house they called Michigan Stadium

3788,"I beleive that high water levels in Lake ontario also lead to high water levels in Lake Erie.  I think water was held back in some of the lakes feeding into Lake ontario as well but someone else may know better about this.

Also that the high water levels impact more than just those living on Toronto Islands depending how much higher the water is.  It can impact every marina on Lake Ontario as well as those living close to shore.

I agree it is not an easy decision.  Someone will suffer in the end.  IMO those who chose to live in an area prone to flooding should bear the brunt of the issue but I can see there may be an argument to spread the issue around if holding water back doesn't cause significant issue for those upstream.  

I haven't heard much about the progress those downstream have made in mitigating their own risk.  If this truly is a climate change issue (I think we are seeing changes in precipitation in recent years which may/may not be long term) then the artificial levels of Lake Ontario and other lakes is only a temporary fix.

3795,Saw a Discovery channel documentary that said due to hydro power generation the water flow over the falls is no longer strong enough to clear out those rocks. Left untouched the falls would actually erode all the way back to Lake Erie....but due to hydro plants that process has essentially stopped. The Niagara riverbed is eroding at a much slower rate now.
3796,"You may have heard of the Lake Erie Bill of Rights (‚ÄúLEBOR‚Äù), an amendment to Toledo, Ohio‚Äôs City Charter that was passed in February 2019. But what is LEBOR? LEBOR is the latest effort within the United States to develop ‚Äúrights of nature‚Äù laws, which declare that ecosystems like Lake Erie have their own fundamental rights. Relying on Ohio‚Äôs Constitution, LEBOR attempts to declare an immediate emergency within Lake Erie‚Äôs ecosystem based largely on Toledo‚Äôs concern for its drinking water, which comes from Lake Erie. You may remember that in 2014 the water supply to Toledo had to be shut down due to toxic algae blooms in Lake Erie caused by water pollution.
LEBOR was intended to permit Toledo, its residents, or Lake Erie itself to enforce the lake‚Äôs proclaimed right to exist, flourish, and remain a clean water source through lawsuits and refusing to acknowledge state or federal permits issued to any corporation that would infringe on Lake Erie‚Äôs rights. Its primary targets: farms, dairies, and industries with run-off or discharges to Lake Erie, even though these discharges are already regulated by state and federal laws.
LEBOR is not the first attempt to have the rights of nature recognized in the United States. In 1972, the United States Supreme Court considered whether nature or natural features should have rights, and correspondingly legal standing to enforce those rights, in¬†Sierra Club v Morton.1¬†The United States Supreme Court held that environmental objects did not have legal standing to sue for their own preservation. Justice William O. Douglass penned the lone dissent, stating that ‚Äú[c]ontemporary public concern for protecting nature‚Äôs ecological equilibrium should lead to the conferral of standing upon environmental objects to sue for their own preservation.‚Äù2
The day after LEBOR was approved by Toledo voters, an Ohio farm filed a federal lawsuit against Toledo. The State of Ohio joined the lawsuit alongside the farm, challenging LEBOR as both unconstitutional and preempted by state and federal law. Interestingly, a motion was filed by parties aligned with Toledo to permit the Lake Erie Ecosystem itself to participate in the lawsuit. The federal judged denied the motion, holding that Lake Erie lacked capacity to sue because the ‚Äúrights of nature‚Äù legal concept is not recognized in the United States.
While the lawsuit is still ongoing, a preliminary injunction was issued stopping Toledo from formally adopting LEBOR as part of its City Charter and forbidding any enforcement actions or lawsuits pursuant to LEBOR until the case is decided. A motion to dismiss the lawsuit has been filed and should be heard in the coming months. In the meantime, other Toledo citizens have also filed a lawsuit against the State of Ohio requesting that LEBOR be found enforceable due to Ohio‚Äôs alleged failure to address pollution in Lake Erie.
While LEBOR will likely be struck down, these cases are worth keeping an eye on. Water quality concerns in Lake Erie will remain a hot topic in both Michigan and Ohio, and how to address Lake Erie‚Äôs pollution and algae blooms may affect Michigan agri-businesses in the future.

3797,"It is not a black eye. It was ruled against but it was a shot worth taking. In the 30 yrs since the GOP has run this state almost completely (only 4 yrs of a Dem Gov and 2 yrs of Senate control) the pollution situation from Western Ohio farms has grown exponentially. The GOP, being EXTREMEMLY agriculture-friendly, has done ZERO to stop this poisoning of Lake Erie's Western Basin."
3798,"This is my in-laws‚Äô house. 

The house to the right of this picture sits a little further back and is protected from wind by the house to the right of it. In this picture the wind is coming from about 4 o‚Äôclock)

The house that is just to the left in this left is MUCH worse. It sits closer to the water and there is a mountain of pure ice basically up to the roof. 

This all happens because of the very high water level in Lake Erie over the past few years."
3799,"I used went to a high school in Hamburg, NY that was right on Lake Erie. It was always wild watching the waves crash over and onto the road"
3800,"Well, the wind off Lake Erie got everything stirred up. So the water is muddier than usual."
3801,"It‚Äôs not snow actually, it‚Äôs ice off Lake Erie. And we‚Äôve had a blizzard here with 50+mph winds, which is what threw the dirty lake water on the house. But when the lake gets all riled up, it pulls up the mud from the bottom of the lake."
3802,This is in fact very real. This is Hoover beach on Lake Erie in Hamburg NY just south of Buffalo.  50 mph winds and some freezing rain and this is the end result. This is only one house of many that look like this.
3803,"I really want to know how this affects Lake Erie though, assuming the Niagara Falls aren't getting backed up by the levels in Lake Ontario."
3804,"Sorry to hear that this is happening in your area. It seems like it is more of an issue in some areas than others. 

They have cracked down on it to some extent in my area and dog owners are bitching about it because they can't bring their dogs onto the swimming beaches anymore. They ruined that themselves though by refusing to clean up after them, not keeping them on leashes so they could bother or even bite others enjoying the beaches, and bringing aggressive dogs.

I am by Lake Erie in PA. It's nice to go to the beach now and not have to worry about stepping in shit while I'm waking on the beach. 

I hope that wherever you live realizes some of the issues and limits where people can bring dogs in natural spaces."
3805,"Yeah here people have to tie it up or the sanitation workers have the option to not take it. 

You wouldn't want to leave it untied around here anyhow. 

I live right near Lake Erie and there is all kinds of wildlife that enjoys getting into your garbage and scattering it--and your neighbors won't be impressed to find trash all over the road."
3806,"I grew up on lake Erie and when i was little, the beach had more sea glass than there were rocks. Now it is all gone because of people collecting it and selling it in tourist shops. Now it's illegal to take what remains"
3807,"I was on Lake Erie a few years ago and the local showing me around pulled up small chunks of black rock to show me. Turns out all the coal that fell overboard or went down with sinking steamships gets the seaglass treatment, too. Keep your eyes peeled next time you're at a beach."
3808,"Moved to Cleveland in 2012. Have been pleasantly surprised how nice of a city it is. Winter can get cold because of the lake but the summer and fall seasons are amazing. Relatively cheap to live here, access to wonderful restaurants, entertainment, pro sports, etc. The Metro Parks are incredible. The lake has made a great turn around in terms of cleanliness. The Lake Erie Islands are only an hour away (Put in Bay, Kelly‚Äôs Island). Definitely a good sweet spot in terms of quality of life/cost of living. 

Also easy access to hospital systems that are routinely ranked highest in the nation in cardiac care and other specialities (Cleveland Clinic). 

Sure, there are nicer weather cities but for the price it‚Äôs hard to beat."
3809,"I might go try to check out the Cleveland Clinic soon, especially if I hear anything strange.


FYI!

Lake Erie which Cleveland Ohio sits on, has miles and miles of tunnels beneath the lake. There is a salt mine that has been in use for ages.

Edit: I'm motivated, are you?"
3810,An interesting location I think would be the Cargill salt mine. Its located right on the shoreline and connects to mines down under lake Erie. http://www.rockthelake.com/buzz/2017/12/cargill-salt-mine-cleveland/
3811,"Here is info on the non-profit that that Rolling Stone chose to omit in their article:

-------------------------------
The Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund continues to target communities in Pennsylvania and Ohio for so-called Rights of Nature initiatives aimed at banning fracking and other regulated development activities. Initiatives similar to those that have appeared in Youngstown and the Lake Erie region in Ohio, as well as Grant Township and Potter County, Pa., have been rejected by several courts and voters, and proven costly for taxpayers.

Here‚Äôs what Pennsylvania and Ohio residents should know about the group behind the initiatives:

**What is the Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund (CELDF)?**

CELDF is a nonprofit law firm based in Mercersburg, Pa., west of Gettysburg. It offers communities ‚Äúfree‚Äù services to draft local ordinances and provide legal representation for the communities that pass them. Ordinances ‚Äì which go by names such as ‚ÄúCommunity Bill of Rights,‚Äù ‚ÄúRights of Nature,‚Äù ‚ÄúCharter amendments or home rule‚Äù initiatives ‚Äì often fail or end up in litigation, with the costs for either outcome falling to taxpayers in those communities. CELDF started out fighting ‚Äúfactory farms‚Äù and has since set its sights on the oil and gas industry.

**Who is CELDF?**

Founder and Executive Director Thomas Linzey‚Äôs agenda is based on a dismantling of private property rights, as he made clear in a 2015 speech:

&gt; ‚ÄúIf you are going to put all that work into a ballot initiative, why not do a ballot initiative that bans all finance companies in New York City from funding new projects that exasperate climate change? Why not do something real‚Ä¶why not do something real‚Ä¶cause people are saying to themselves, ‚Äòit would be illegal, it would be unlawful, it would be unconstitutional, because you are taking their property‚Äô well..(expletive), it‚Äôs time.‚Äù 

Additionally, in 2016 Linzey told audiences in Lancaster that ‚ÄúPennsylvania‚Äôs constitution is a weapon for corporations,‚Äù and that it‚Äôs ‚Äútime for a revolt.‚Äù

He‚Äôs not the only extreme voice in the group. In a 2015 meeting in Youngstown, CELDF National Organizer Ben Price told attendees that ‚Äúwe‚Äôre gonna make decisions in here that the rest of the community will just have to live with ‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs how it‚Äôs done!‚Äù

CELDF‚Äôs Pennsylvania Community Organizer Chad Nicholson, who hails from Spokane, Washington, has given numerous presentations, including one titled ‚ÄúDefying the Corporate State,‚Äù to communities across Pennsylvania.  Nicholson said in 2017:

&gt; ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs be clear: our state agencies, tasked with ‚Äòenvironmental protection,‚Äô are legalizing harmful activities by issuing permits to corporations with histories of violations. And, they are doing so against the will and sovereign law of the people who live in the community.‚Äù

Also in 2017, Nicholson said that ‚Äúfrom the very beginning of this country‚Äôs founding with our Constitution that was written in 1787,‚Äù we ‚Äúdon‚Äôt really have a democracy to begin with, that it‚Äôs not just failing.‚Äù

CELDF‚Äôs Board of Advisors includes Gasland director Josh Fox; Karenna Gore, who is the founding director of the Center for Earth Ethics in New York and Al Gore‚Äôs wife; Rainforest Action Network founder Randy Hayes; former Pittsburgh city councilman Doug Shields; and other anti-industry activists.

**CELDF‚Äôs record**

CELDF does not have a winning record and its desire to prolong litigation even when it knows it has no chance of winning is well documented.  In 2018, a Pennsylvania federal judge reprimanded CELDF attorneys (including its founder and executive director, Thomas Linzey) for ‚Äúbad faith‚Äù efforts to impose a ban on an injection well in Grant Township, Indiana County. U.S. District Court Judge Susan Baxter ordered the organization to pay $52,000 in legal costs and said in her ruling:

&gt;‚ÄúThis Court has determined that Attorneys Linzey and Dunne have pursued certain claims and defenses in bad faith. Based upon prior CELDF litigation, each was on notice of the legal implausibility of the arguments previously advanced‚Ä¶‚Äù

&gt; ‚ÄúDespite their own prior litigation, CELDF and Attorney Linzey, in particular, continue to advance discredited arguments as a basis for CELDF‚Äôs ill-conceived and sponsored CBR, and in doing so have vexatiously multiplied the litigation of this matter.‚Äù 

CELDF focuses on using litigation to drive conversation, regardless of the cost that these irresponsible cases can bring on municipalities and taxpayers. When asked about CELDF‚Äôs ultimate motivation, Reuters reported:

&gt; ‚ÄúLinzey says his goal is not to write local laws that are popular, or stand up in court, but rather to trigger a public debate about community rights to local self-government ‚Äì even if it means a community ultimately falls into financial ruin.‚Äù

**Who pays for CELDF initiatives and legal costs?**

CELDF‚Äôs failed initiatives have already cost taxpayers in places such as Youngstown tens of thousands of dollars. Voters in the city recently rejected a CELDF ballot initiative for the eighth time. The costs to taxpayers doesn‚Äôt appear to bother Linzey, who said,

&gt;‚ÄúIf a town goes bankrupt trying to defend one of our ordinances, well, perhaps that‚Äôs exactly what is needed to trigger a national movement.‚Äù 

**Who funds CELDF?**

How can CELDF afford such repeated failure? It‚Äôs funded through foundations and private donations. They include the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, Heinz Endowments, Wallace Global Fund and others that actively support anti-fracking and anti-industry groups and initiatives.

**What is a ‚Äúrights of nature‚Äù initiative?**

Linzey explained the organization‚Äôs ‚Äúrights of nature‚Äù movement as:

&gt;‚ÄúWhat is increasingly growing is a realization that for a real environmental movement to occur, ecosystems must have legally enforceable rights of their own.‚Äù 

CELDF has not been successful defending ‚Äúrights of nature‚Äù initiatives in Pennsylvania. Most recently, following CELDF‚Äôs attempt to intervene in a lawsuit on behalf of the ecosystem, Judge Baxter ruled:

&gt;‚ÄúAs to the issue of whether the Little Mahoning Watershed, an ecosystem, has standing under the law, no determination need be made here. Clear and convincing evidence has not been produced to show that [the township‚Äôs] vigorous defense of the Ordinance, the terms of which protect the Watershed in all of its locations, do not line up precisely.‚Äù 

Baxter also explained,

&gt;‚ÄúAlthough defendant wishes it were not so, the development of oil and gas (which necessarily includes the management of waste materials generated at a well site) is a legitimate business activity and land use within Pennsylvania.

&gt; ‚Ä¶

&gt;‚ÄúThere is no state authority expressly granting a municipal government or its people the authority to regulate the depositing of waste from oil and gas wells or to invalidate permits granted by the state or federal government. Any provision enacted without underlying legislative authority is invalid and unenforceable.‚Äù

As recent years have demonstrated, CELDF will continue to advance its unlawful and unconstitutional agenda so long as wealthy foundations that fund the ‚ÄúKeep It In the Ground‚Äù agenda continue to provide the means for it to do so. And given CELDF‚Äôs dismal track record, taxpayers will continue to foot the bill for this folly."
3812,I only been to lake Erie.  all you see there is dead bloated fish and garbage.
3813,"Or, and just consider the possibility, that the world is just doing its thing, and might not even know we are even here.  We have only been here with any significance for maybe 6000 years.  That's a blink of an eye for a planet that has been around for about 4 billion years. 

4 Billion years Earth has, 6000 years have we.   

We have been here on the planet for about 3 minutes and spare change of seconds of it's existence. 

And this planet that has gone through hot and cold ages for billions of years, and several planetary extinction events hundreds of millions of years ago, you think we have any effect on this planet?  

Oh, sure, we are good at polluting, look at Lake Erie in the 70's. Look at Puget Sound. Look at the BP spill in the Gulf. Look at them now.  

Somehow the earth survived all that. And, so did we. In a few years. 

The hubris we have thinking we control our planet, it's embarrassing.

And it won't bother to notice."
3814,More people at home has meant more trash and water consumption. Trash gets picked up by the wind and eventually ends up in the river. The more waste water and heavy septic system use (especially in septic systems new to high demand) means very poor water quality and clarity. The river I'm talking about eventually dumps into lake erie.
3815,"A desperate midnight run across Lake Erie in a small fast sloop, loaded with rum and M95 masks to offset the cost."
3816,"Think where we were in 1970:
Southern California was choking on automobile exhaust fumes
Lake Erie had been turned lifeless having been poisoned with raw sewage and industrial effluent
Bald Eagles were being driven to extinction by DDT
The Adirondacks were being pelted with acid rain
The ozone layer was being depleted by refrigerants

The fact that we think the sky is falling because temperatures will rise 2-3 degrees over preindustrial levels just shows how much progress we've made as we've moved on to more and more trifling threats."
3817,"Well, as far as the silliness of the lyrics goes, they are a little awkward, but in the late sixties, water pollution was so blatant and unrestricted (I grew up near Lake Erie and the famous flaming Cuyahoga River) that I think that the lyrics did display a legitimate concern for water quality in a hippie kind of way (this was before the EPA, even-- Nixon started that, believe it or not). So I totally overlooked the goofiness at the time. Kind of like Student Demonstration Time-- I mean, violent protest in the streets was so common in the Viet Nam war days... \[old Boomer guy rambling, blah, blah...\]"
3818,"yeh 'blood and soil' is bad even if it's non-white people (not that anyone's really suggesting that, just saying in general). I think the idea is that natives are given far more autonomy over larger areas, rather than being stuffed in tiny reservation areas. and quite frankly, I think the Haudenosaunee would take far better care of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario if they had stewardship of it."

3821,My city (Toledo) was on national news daily for a week in like 2014 when Lake Erie had so much algae that our water was toxic so like 1 million people couldn't drink water for 6 days. Also in 2015 a giant ball at our art museum rolled away in wind and went around town for a few hours.
3822,"&gt;Ever looked at the Aral Sea and wondered why is it so small? Socialism. Union of Soviet Socialist Republic gave away free water to everyone and boom. Drought.

Almost all countries have done a dogshit job protecting the environment."
3823,"This kind of stupidity is a great example of how nothing good comes from Ohio. They used to dump so much filth into rivers and Lake Erie they would catch fire. Cincinnati is famous for slopping nasty imitations of chili on any manner of food. A crummy rock and roll museum in crummy Cleveland. Morons who say ""THE Ohio State"" as if any other universities wanted to claim they are from Ohio. Sports fans burning LeBron merch for him leaving Cleveland, then weeping joyfully and praising his return. A string of forgettable presidents. And now a dumbass state level politician trying to use her experience from family court to level international crime accusations against the sitting president. She'd get more famous faster ""leaking"" a sex tape. And would look half as trashy in the process."
3824,"Okay so my current thought process is that what we see as ohio is actually about 1 square mile of land and significant portions of lake Erie. The Area would I imagine release some type of cognitohazard gas that creates the idea of Ohio for anyone entering through the area, furthermore the distortions in the real square milage and area in other parts of the US, i.e West Virginia, Illinois, and Kentucky, are also affected by the change in perception.

But really, there was a huge balloon release in Cleveland in the 80s that makes me angry, and I grew up in a Cleveland suburb.  There's a modern documentary on it you can find on YouTube.  It was like a second eco embarrassment for Cleveland beside the river catch fire which is the event which got the EPA started.  The balloons all fell into Lake Erie.

3833," I'm respectfully and politely going to recommend that you move to Roanoke.

Buffalo is much colder, wetter, snowier, windier, icier, with a phenomenon called ""lake effect snow"".  Furthermore, There are lingering effects that Buffalo suffers from as being one of the original rust belt cities.  Thus there are pockets of poverty and crime scattered throughout the city which don't exist in Roanoke.  (yes there are small areas of poverty in ROA, but not the miles of boarded up housing war zones I've experienced in rust belt cities up north.)

As far as the climate goes, there is no comparison.  West of  Buffalo, when Lake Erie experiences sunlight and evaporates, the evaporated lake water turns to snow and dumps itself onto shores and land east of Lake Erie (and Lake Ontario).  This can lead to a seemingly endless pummeling of snowfall for weeks and months.  I lived in Cleveland for 44 years, and it's what drove me out of the city (not to mention the increasing levels of poverty and crime) and it's probably what will badger you for the rest of your stay in Buffalo if you decide to live there. One particular winter the high temperature did not go above 29 degrees for 40 straight days, all with six to fourteen inches of snow.

Furthermore, Roanoke is incredible!  Super friendly people, and unbelievably beautiful mountains, hiking trails, scenic driving, and a much warmer climate (didn't snow above 2"" this year).  Moving to Roanoke is the best decision I have ever made."
3834,"Ohio. Think about it. Nuclear power plants leaking into lakes and rivers. . Alligator gar. Mayfly swarms that blanket whole cities. Over 112 haunted houses. Some kinda giant sea beast in lake erie.

Now imagine that all *after* a few nukes."
3835,"Carp were widely touted to produce fish meat around that time. Just like with the asian carp in the Mississippi waterways, they spread and devastated places.

They put them in lake Erie then were like ""the carp ate all the native rice and the shoreline erosion is worse! Now the ducks have nothing to eat either!"""
3836,And Lake Erie has gotten a lot cleaner in the last few decades. I remember even just 15 years ago it was so common to see dead fish line the beaches.
3837,"I'm from Lake Erie, which is very small by comparison. There's a thin peninsula that stretches about halfway across the lake, the skinny way. My hometown sits to the side and above the causeway and it stretches over the horizon. So if I've described it well enough that gives you an idea of how big even a small portion of the great lakes is"
3838,"I was joking, obviously he's talking about pollution and chemical runoff. But seriously, you basically can't drink any water that fish live in, so this is a useless rule of thumb. You'd get giardia from drinking water out of Lake Arthur or Lake Erie or this Mississippi River. And places like Lake Erie often have prohibited swimming from algal blooms or in some cases even elevated e. coli levels. And yet it's still completely fine to eat fish from these waters."

There used to be a huge dead zone along the shipping channel from Lake Erie, and now they‚Äôve removed some of the bulkheads along the bank and fish are living there. They used to refine oil and make chemicals all along the first few miles of the river, and now all of that is gone."
3847,"Guys, I feel like no one is listening to my drain solution. Seriously, dump it in Lake Erie; you'll basically be purifying it."

3849,"Lake Superior has more fresh water than the other four Great Lakes combined! 

I was looking for Great Lakes facts and just found that one (it‚Äôs 34% of the total surface area and 53% of the volume). Other fun (and less fun) facts:

* Lake Superior could submerge the Americas in 1 ft of water
* The Lorax (in 1971) referenced Lake Erie due to how badly the smallest Great Lake was polluted
* Lake Superior has a residence time of 200 years (the water leaving today could have flowed in around the year Napoleon died)
* In the 1960s, the lakes were stocked with game fish salmon to inspire tourism, but also to eat up alewives. Alewives had gotten so numerous that they died off in hoards - once burying the shoreline of Chicago in up to a foot of... rotting fish goop. (This actually worked out for a surprising amount of time, but non-native mussels worked from the bottom up and took out the alewives food supply.)"

3852,"Yes, I'm from the Bay Area as an Environmental Programs Manager and garbage can placement is HUGE. We have taken a page from Disneyland and tried placing our cans in closer proximity to each other AND in locations where people will likely have trash with them (e.g outside of restaurants, picnic areas, etc.). The problem is the cost of maintenance. All of those cans have to be emptied at least once a week, and the cost of installing them can be pricey (we once got a quote for 10 cans at 10k). So while adding more cans is the best, figuring out placement of what you have is a great BMP. 

You should give data driven results of litter reduction when cans are repurposed in new locations and the area of effect for each can (a little markers around the can on a map to show trash is reduced within this area).

Also I would add pet waste in your study for litter. Many agencies will have to come into compliance with F.coli TMDLs for their watersheds. Reducing pet waste has been shown to help in bringing that down (as well as reducing excess sediment and vegetation). Anyway, I love the idea and progress your team has made, keep up the good work :)."
3853,You know that Lake Erie caught on fire once from all the crap floating around in it?  I wish I could have seen that.

Next to all of that, climate change is decidedly a minor crisis."
3857,"As of now, you're correct.  It wasn't always like that though.  That's always been the problem with any government agency.  After awhile, corruption tends to eat away at anything.  Had it not been made and the city hadn't been forced into cleaning the river up, people never would have cared and it would have eventually polluted Lake Erie.  Like I said, you can choose to ignore what good it did do but I won't.  If you're unwilling to give credit where it is due then you're just being close minded.  If that agency still functioned the way it did when it was first started, we wouldn't even be having this discussion.

I personally don't blame the agency itself though or any other for that matter.  I hold the people that operate them as the responsible parties.  By your reasoning though, the state DID respect property rights.  Which is precisely why that river became so polluted.  They accepted it simply as a result of industrialization so long as jobs were booming there, they didn't give a shit what any of the companies did there as far as dumping waste.  They thoroughly believed those very companies would regulate themselves on their own properties.  Guess what?  They didn't do that until it was forced upon them and rightfully so in this matter."

3859,"Same thing happening in the other Great lakes. Look at upstate New York up around Rochester, Lake Ontario is swallowing lakeshore with all-too-frequent devastating effects to the properties.

Same thing around the upper Niagara River and Lake Erie around Buffalo. Great Waters that have survive the generation are now completely inadequate and in some places are failing."
3860,"I started bird watching in HS in the late 70's (shoutout to Tom Kemp at AWHS, Whitehouse OH .... a great teacher!).

I had lived within a couple blocks of the Maumee River most of my life and never seen a bald eagle on the river.

At that time I think there were only 8 nesting pairs in the entire state of Ohio, and the nearest nest to my town was 40 miles away at Ottawa Refuge on Lake Erie.

Currently, there are eagles nesting roughly every 5 miles along the Maumee River, and it is pretty much impossible to be along the river and not see one.


It shows what environmental protection, hunting regulation (the switch to steel shot stopped lead poisoning in eagles that ate wounded ducks), habitat protection, and public awareness can do.

Too bad we currently have a president and an administration dead set an rolling back so many of our environmental gains."
3861,"I want a Fallout based around Ohio so badly. The Fallout RPG Wiki tells the tale that;

Columbus is a bustling trader city with shops and inns and is extremely secure

Akron was remotely untouched by the bombs in part thanks to a missile defense system set in place at the James A. Garfield Joint Military Training Center and is a raider warzone town

Dayton was hit hard being that it is home to Wright Patterson AFB, which ironically wasn't hit very hard and continues standing and operating to help those in need

Toledo was hit by a couple bombs outside the perimeter, but remains standing as a trader town along the Maumee river and Lake Erie

Sandusky and Cedar Point are a slaver hub

Put-in-bay/Middle Bass/St. George/Kelleys Island are Mirelurk hellholes

Ashtabula/Canton/Youngstown are all Minutemen controlled

Lima is controlled by the Brotherhood and is complete lockdown do to it housing the Joint Systems Manufacturing Center/Lima Army Tank Plant. The plant manufactured vehicles such as the M26 Pershing and M1 Abrams, and houses returned and decommissioned military vehicles.

And Cleveland (my home town), and Cincinnati, the second and third largest cities in the state respectively, have been effectively obliterated, having multiple bombs dropped within city limits. They now play host to supermutants, feral ghoul swarms, and mirelurks. Cleveland got the worst, and the subsequent radiation falloff has polluted the southern portion of Lake Erie beyond purification.

Hydrocolloid sheets feel good,  especially when refrigerated, I prefer no adhesive.  They have special pillows depending on the site of surgery or radiation because sleeping can become uncomfortable (I got one of these from a friend and it was great)  and  cold caps if hair loss is a risk.

The organizers had to do this  for a specific reason dealing with the Clean Water Act.  The area is in or around a couple of different properties from private, local, and state.  The encampments were getting pushed from one property to the next.  The organizers could not get people to work together.  So (long story short) the trash survey was done to show that the TMDL of trash was exceeding the CWA.  Lo and behold city put resources into coordinating and cleaning the area.  They didnt see the light but felt the heat  but it worked.  Those needing help were offered the resources.  Those that didn't had to move on.  Then efforts were focused on clearing non native arrundo dorax (giant reed) and native restoration.   The arrundo gave the criminal and tweaker populations great cover.  With its removal the bike thieves move on.  But it started with the survey and CWA enforcement.  This was a novel approach but it could easily be done in any other city where bureaucracy and red tape hinders needed clean up.  Homeless isnt a fun topic that politicians want to tackle.

3891,"Background story:
The game takes place 50 years after the events of Fallout 3. Currently, the area is completely split up, with the BoS controlling a small portion of Buffalo, the Ronto tribe controlling the north, and the Pitt Raiders controlling the south. The Pennsylvania wilderness has become a hotbed of tribes and the only enclave presence left in the area is a small ‚Äúenclave‚Äù (heh) of them located in Chautauqua. Currently, conflict ensues as the Pitt Raiders and the Ronto tribe push to take control of the rail lines as well as Niagara for an inclusion of power and water supply. It is up to you to decide how this ensues.

I figured that this game would allow for the perfect introduction of vehicles. Maybe not cars, but there could be rail cars and boats. This would also allow for a lot of environmental changes. For instance, I could see that the damn was shut down and Huron was drained to create a massive desert. Also, there could be abunch of shanty towns located on Lake Erie, all in a Libertalia style. They could also really take a deep dive into Lovecraftian lore here, with water creatures and the likes"

The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down

Of the big lake they called Gitche Gumee

The lake, it is said, never gives up her dead

When the skies of November turn gloomy

With a load of iron ore twenty-six thousand tons more

Than the Edmund Fitzgerald weighed empty

That good ship and crew was a bone to be chewed

When the gales of November came early

The ship was the pride of the American side

Coming back from some mill in Wisconsin

As the big freighters go, it was bigger than most

With a crew and good captain well seasoned

Concluding some terms with a couple of steel firms

When they left fully loaded for Cleveland

And later that night when the ship's bell rang

Could it be the north wind they'd been feelin'?

The wind in the wires made a tattle-tale sound

And a wave broke over the railing

And every man knew, as the captain did too,

T'was the witch of November come stealin'

The dawn came late and the breakfast had to wait

When the gales of November came slashin'

When afternoon came it was freezin' rain

In the face of a hurricane west wind

When suppertime came, the old cook came on deck sayin'

Fellas, it's too rough to feed ya

At seven p.m., a main hatchway caved in, he said

Fellas, it's been good to know ya

The captain wired in he had water comin' in

And the good ship and crew was in peril

And later that night when 'is lights went outta sight

Came the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald

Does any one know where the love of God goes

When the waves turn the minutes to hours?

The searchers all say they'd have made Whitefish Bay

If they'd put fifteen more miles behind 'er

They might have split up or they might have capsized

They may have broke deep and took water

And all that remains is the faces and the names

Of the wives and the sons and the daughters

Lake Huron rolls, Superior sings

In the rooms of her ice-water mansion

Old Michigan steams like a young man's dreams

The islands and bays are for sportsmen

And farther below Lake Ontario

Takes in what Lake Erie can send her

And the iron boats go as the mariners all know

With the gales of November remembered

In a musty old hall in Detroit they prayed,

In the maritime sailors' cathedral

The church bell chimed till it rang twenty-nine times

For each man on the Edmund Fitzgerald

The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down

Of the big lake they called Gitche Gumee

Superior, they said, never gives up her dead

When the gales of November come early

3931,"Depends on the day... or hour. I kayak on Lake Erie (when it's not frozen solid or 50 degrees F). I think waves are almost 100% dependent on wind on the Great Lakes. There are plenty of days I'm not brave enough to go out. On very windy days the waves can be six or eight feet high (I've heard reports of them being twice that, depending on what the bottom is like in the area). There are also cases, at least around my neck of Lake Erie, of people being sucked out into the lake by nasty undertow and huge waves during wild weather."
3932,"I live near Lake Erie. We have miles of lovely beach. It's not white-sand ocean beach; it's dark-sand pebbly or rocky beach, or shale beach (which is quite different). Often it's low cliffs dropping to a narrow beach or right into the lake. It's completely gorgeous.

*Edit*: It's kayakable maybe half the year (south shore of Lake Erie), though for a couple of those months you'll need cold water gear to be safe. For three or four months of the year it's warm and amazing. I go out in shorts and a t-shirt, with my PFD when it's not like a glass mirror (otherwise, PFD strapped to the deck in arm's reach). During the summer months my challenge is to avoid sunburn and heat stroke. And when it's cold, it's really fucking cold. The beaches are still beautiful, if you're bundled up. The ice isn't some pretty sheet of white stretching to the horizon; because of pressure from farther out in the lake, what used to be our water turns into something like Superman's Fortress of Solitude: big, angular, jagged slabs of ice sticking up at odd angles, for miles and miles.

Yes, unregulated dumping is still a problem despite decades of cleanup and regulation efforts. It's generally safe to swim where I live, though this is partly (I've been told) because of invasive species like Zebra Mussels which filter the water so aggressively that they endanger native fish and plants. 

Cleaning up industrial, city, and farm pollution is an ongoing battle (but progressing, thank you, and much, much better than a couple of decades ago), but one of the worst pollution issues in freshwater lakes in North America, including all the Great  Lakes, is microplastics. Not as much scare factor as your breathless tales of horror, but they really fuck up ecosystems, and aren't particularly good for people, either. Check out the scholarly work of Sherri A. Mason for the gory details."

3939,"It looks like it wasn‚Äôt a sudden revocation but the plant had violated permit limits for ammonia and naphthalene for at least two years. At least on the ammonia side, part of the crackdown is likely because it is a factor in eutrophication of Lake Erie, which serves as a drinking water supply that algal blooms can adversely effect, and eutrophication has become more common in the lake in recent years. It‚Äôs not uncommon for there to be pre-treatment standards before discharging to a municipal sewer, so in the end it sounds like the plant didn‚Äôt want to (or determined it wasn‚Äôt economical to) pay for their own industrial wastewater treatment system, even though that‚Äôs what would be required."

3950,This is probably one of the Great Lakes. Walleye population is growing faster than it ever has. Our states finally caught on to good environmental practices for our fisheries. On Lake Erie alone there is over 40 million Walleye. The daily limit is 5 in New York. 10 fish in a few hours for 2 people is common.
3951,I went to Lake Erie a couple days ago and saw chip bags floating in the water... Pathetic
3952,"I beg to differ sir. I‚Äôve been a hunter, fisherman, and gardener since I was a little boy. Sometimes you go out and come back with hardly nothing, but for a skilled woodsman such as myself (not to brag), those days are few and far between. The days that happens are outweighed by the days you come back with a large game animal or a pile of fish. Take this morning for example, I went fishing for about 5 or 6 hours and came home with 4 catfish, 3 drum, and a perch. That‚Äôs more than I can personally eat in one sitting by a lot, so if I was living off what I was able to collect from nature and nothing more I‚Äôd have had a surplus of food. When I do the math I made the calories I spent today back in an hour of fishing so I‚Äôd have had a lot of extra fish to smoke and keep for later. That‚Äôs fishing completely legally with my limit of 2 lines attached to 2 fishing rods at a time with a maximum of 2 hooks per line. No nets, no funnel traps, no trotlines or setlines, no shooting carp with my bow, nothing besides my legal limit of 2 fishing rods per fisherman in our polluted overfished waters of the modern era. Imagine if I could break the law and set a gill net or a trotline out. Imagine if I could shoot the passing ducks and geese and buzzards. Imagine if I could trap the woodchuck and the mink around the area. That‚Äôs just a public Lake Erie water access point with hundreds of boats going by per day and charter fisherman ripping up the fish populations. 


It‚Äôs hard to make ones living off the land, but it is natural. I find my job much more degrading than sitting on the side of the lake or ‚Äúsurvival camping‚Äù with my buddy where we go out and only eat wild foods for a set period of time. I could do that shit every day. 


From my small, 1/8th of an acre garden I have been able to yield so far probobly 20 pounds of beans as well as some young diakon long radishes, I‚Äôd guess about 8 pounds of them. Imagine if I had all the time in the day to make that garden bigger with hand tools. Between fishing legally and gardening legally I could reasonably sustain myself. I‚Äôd harvest surpluses of fish when I could and smoke it to preserve it long term and sun dry vegetables I grow. Imagine if our earth wasn‚Äôt god knows how many degrees hotter than it‚Äôs supposed to be and the big Lake Erie actually still froze enough for icefishing. If that was the case I could reasonably feed myself off just fishing and gardening legally. I plan to return to wild nature one day, Michigan‚Äôs UP or Alaska, near the Innoko River. The laws won‚Äôt effect me when I do that. How do you think I‚Äôd be able to do? I‚Äôd venture to say I‚Äôd be eating pretty well"
3953,I live kinda close to the NY part of Lake Erie. Water is disgusting up here. It‚Äôs black and you can‚Äôt see more than 3 inches in the water. It‚Äôs super polluted and has tons of algae. It‚Äôs been shut down like 6 times in a year because of pollution from Kodak.
3954,"Buffalo was supposed to be beautiful. Then they put a highway through the middle of it. Then they made the speed limit 30mph (used to be 50) and have cops hidden behind every corner waiting to catch you speeding.

3956,"&gt; People went to fossil fuels because ... renewables didn't exist yet.

What utter ignorant nonsense.&amp;nbsp; ""Renewables"" are the ORIGINAL energy source.&amp;nbsp; The first uses of wind and water power are lost in history, solar has always been used to dry food for storage (not to mention orienting buildings to capture warmth), and biomass is the raw material for that defining human invention, fire.

Muscle built the dikes which separated Holland's polders from the North Sea, but wind pumped the seawater out of them.&amp;nbsp; Don Quixote attacked ""renewable energy devices"" with his lance centuries before Newcomen and Watt.

The ""renewables"" were abandoned because, frankly, they suck.&amp;nbsp; Plants in general (let alone trees) just do not grow fast enough to provide for human energy needs; whole countries were almost denuded for firewood and building material.&amp;nbsp; And when coal was first being used as heating fuel, mines were pumped out with wind-powered pumps a la Holland when they were dug down to the water table.&amp;nbsp; Problem with that was, a calm stretch let the mines flood and nobody could work.&amp;nbsp; No work, no coal.&amp;nbsp; No coal, no money.&amp;nbsp; No money, no food.&amp;nbsp; Starvation really sucks.&amp;nbsp; So do lung disease and blindness from the smoke from indoor dung fires for cooking.

Do you begin to understand why steam power took off so fast, and why it was NOT driven by ""free"" solar energy?&amp;nbsp; A little time reading up on technological history could save whole societies from going over the cliff at the end of the romantic fantasy road.

&gt; Why can't we have solar, wind and storage, with nuclear peaker plants?

I'm assigning you some homework.&amp;nbsp; Calculate the average electric power demand of the USA (any figures after 2015 will do).&amp;nbsp; Assume a need of 2 months of storage to deal with seasonal surpluses and deficits of ""renewables"".&amp;nbsp; You are given the entire water volume of Lake Erie to use for pumped-hydro storage.&amp;nbsp; How high would you have to lift it to store the required amount of energy?

I'll give you a direct answer when you show some will to understand things on your own.&amp;nbsp; It'll make you appreciate the work that goes into informed opinions in these matters.

&gt; Is there no room for solar or wind in the power mix?

If you have to cover for dark/cloudy and calm conditions, you're going to need other energy period.&amp;nbsp; If you're not saving emissions by not using this other energy, what's the point in not using it all the time instead of the ""renewables""?&amp;nbsp; They become an expense without a benefit.

&gt; Is it necessary to go 100% nuclear to satisfy you?

No.&amp;nbsp; If you have certain classes of dispatchable loads, you can make use of plenty of intermittent, unreliable energy.&amp;nbsp; You just can't use them for much else, or rather, if you're not really saving anything then there's no point.

Among the things that ""renewables"" are mostly useless for:  
* Municipal water and sewage treatment  
* Food refrigeration, preparation and delivery  
* Powering industry like steel mills and semiconductor fabs  
* Keeping EV batteries charged (waiting for the wind to blow before you can drive to work is a non-starter)  

If you can convert today's short-term excess of electricity or heat into something that's both compact and easily stored for weeks or months, you can make use of unreliable energy.&amp;nbsp; I lean toward methanol/dimethyl ether as storage media for that exact reason."
3957,Whenever I start thinking like this I remember Vietnam era was probably waaaay more effed. Lake Erie was on fire. They were shooting college kids.  They were drafting kids to go to war for years.
3958,"One more note is that the fertilizer used in lawns will turn into runoff in rivers. In places like the Chesapeake Bay or Lake Erie (though Erie also gets farm runoff) that get the fertilizer from some dozens of millions of lawns, the fertilizer creates algae blooms. 

These blooms are murderous to the local wildlife in the area, creating miles wide dead zones. In Erie the dead zone can span nearly half the fucking lake. In Toledo the water is totally undrinkable during parts of summer (a week or two at a time) sometimes because toxic algae overgrows enough to influence drinking water quality.

Lawns are a plague that hurt not only their nearby areas, but also everything in their entire watershed."
3959,My parents live on Lake Erie and there's absolutely no shortage of insects over there. In fact I think they may be the insect breeding ground that will save the world.

3963,"You have to get emissions tests in the northern counties of Ohio bordering Lake Erie, but not anywhere else in the state. Not really sure why, especially since interstate 80/90 is probably one of the most traveled-by-outsiders roads ever, being the main route from New York to Chicago. If they are trying to keep scuzz out of the air, they are missing lots of cars."
3964,"&gt;Of course they do. Its not just the Military, thats just how tax money is treated. Like FREE money.

Yeah dawg that's why shes proposing to reel it in. That's what is supposed to happen. Saying you know it's broken so keep it broken is just defeatist. 

&gt;Hows that? We share a climate lol

Good question, actually. We all share a climate but we do not all share the same level of access to resources and infrastructure. For example, A low income neighborhood will not have nearly the same level sewer and water infrastructure to accommodate increased flooding from rising water levels (this is actively happening, Lake Erie has experienced record water levels for 3 years straight now). Furthermore, a low income family will not have the same mobility to move to less affected areas."
3965,"Well, you can't give them ALL of the credit.  Ironically enough, ecological conservationists oppose this more than you would think.
The size of a wind turbine means it has a large effect on wildlife.  One of the reasons the Great Lakes haven't really been utilized is due to the possible effects on the migratory patterns of native birds.  Also the fish would be affected, but lake Erie is a toxic mess anyway...  Apparently mutant fish and lake algie conservation is important.
Jokes aside though, you also have to consider shipping lanes and the like for water based turbines, which is another big limitation.  Money talks, and even small delays that a turbine farm might cause means less profits.  Woe befall anyone who stands in the way of profits."
3966,"Yeah, don‚Äôt go smelling Lake Erie, lol. I mean, I love it because it‚Äôs home to me...but jeez, it is pretty terrible."
3967,"&gt;We do have Lake Erie going for us

Except for the Harmful Algae Bloom every summer in the western basin"
3968,That isn't the only problem and it isn't entirely the farmers of Michigan's fault. The entire Maumee watershed and the farms around it are the problem. Much of the fertilizer has phosphorous and other chemicals in it that algae consume and fuel their reproduction and it isn't just poop that is used and it's used on farms across the country. Western Lake Erie is just unfortunate enough to have a large river flowing into it packed with the stuff and to be relatively shallow so it collects quickly.
3969,"Down the Canadian side of Lake Erie there is faster stream of moving water called the Emerald Stream.  At the turn of the last century people were getting sick from Lake water.  In 1900 Buffalo was a major city, hosted the Pam Am Expo and as the terminus of the Erie Canal every traveler headed west stopped.  Clean water was needed to keep travel safe.  In a huge construction project that pump house was built along with a giant under lake tunnel to bring clean  water to the city.  The waste rock from the tunnel was used to build a lake side park.  There is a pump house in that park with the largest triple action steam pumps ever built to pump the water.  The pumps still exist, but as show only as electric pumps took over in the 70s. The pump house and tunnel are still in operation."
3970,It's easier to point a finger at group of people than at an entire society. Few remember when Lake Erie was dead from pollution before I was born. Now I get to enjoy it with my kids.
3971,"I‚Äôm glad you mentioned the Swamp. There is talk of letting portions of land return to swamp land to offset the pollution on the west side of Lake Erie

3972,But it‚Äôs incapable of removing the toxic Microcystin from the water. The amount of time and money that would be required to deploy hundreds of those around Lake Erie to collect the toxin producing algae would be far from economical.
3973,Cleveland has Lake Erie right next to it.  All the water in the drain will end right back in Lake Erie.

3977,"To borrow and adapt a quote from Ron White:  It's not that the the water is a flowin....  It's what's flowin in the water!  

These releases are laden with excessive levels of phosphate fertilizers and animal waste.  Same sh*t happens in Lake Erie, yet salinity is not a factor."
3978,"No attention to the biggest draw in Buffalo ; Lake Erie. It was just depressing. They wanted to put ridiculous things down there instead of just letting the water be the draw. 

They finally started making areas that people could enjoy the water all year long and that's made a big difference. Such as Canalside and River Works and now with the Outer Harbor too."
3979,"Thank you for sharing your experiences. I think one way that would help people really wake up to the idea of climate change are simple stories like this. ‚ÄúHow things aren‚Äôt like they use to be‚Äù and how thats not just a storytelling trope. I‚Äôm from the midwestern US and we use to get mild winters. Would often get as cold as -5C but not far past that in base temperature. Living near Lake Erie the windchill usually made it feel colder.  However growing up the big difference came when school was canceled for different reasons. When I was younger it was because of the amount of snow we got, I remember measuring a snow drift in my yard as 1.2 meters. There would be so much snow the school buses could leave the parking lot and without transportation schools had to call off. More recently however we have been hit with Polar Vortexes starting around 2012 or 2013. Base temperatures reached -35C with windchills making it feel even colder. So either it was way to cold for engines to start or it was too cruel to ask children to wait for a bus in that kind of cold. Having a snow day as a kid but not being able to go outside is probably the weirdest part. We‚Äôre going to keep getting these Vortexes every winter from what I can see and its sad because winter was a very special time for me growing up but now it seems to be changing for the worst."
3980,"Lake Erie gets this often and Toledo, OH sources their water from the lake. So every once in a while we have a water crisis and showering becomes terrifying."
3981,Farm run off. Same reason why lake Erie is being slowly ruined. Eventually it'll just be a nasty green algae lake like St. Mary's lake.
3982,"Actually you couldn't be more wrong. The algal blooms create several lethal chemicals including cyanide and kill everything that swims in them. In the great lakes, phosphorus crates a devastating bloom on lake erie that is miles wide/long. This could be devastating to ocean ecosystems. they should be heavily fined and forced to cease this practice immediately."
3983,"No no no, opioid addiction, lake Erie turning to toxic sludge, small town blight, broken educational funding, et al? No! Those are not priorities. People looking at filthy filthy pictures is where we need to focus our legislative wrath!"
3984,"&gt; algae

Blue-green algae (not technically algae) consumes more oxygen than it produces when it is multiplying then produces cyanotoxins which kill pretty much anything near by... also they thrive in farm run off.... just ask lake erie. About 1/3 of the lake dies every year with the run off blooms. And most catfish don't consume algae."
3985,"You should see the chemtrails they are putting down where I'm at. Deliberate ""X"" shaped.  The thin wavy clouds, like a ruffles potato chip.

3986,"Fun fact: Clear water like this is actually very unhealthy and nutrient deprived. Because of this, nothing can live there, hence the clearness. places like Lake Erie and where the water is more opaque, it's much more healthy and the nutrients provide life for the micro organisms that in turn cause the water to be cloudy"
3987,"It's called ""global warming"" for a reason - the average temperature of the earth is increasing over time.  That prognosis has not changed.  However, the issue with that term is that the [dumbest people on the planet](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/02/26/jim-inhofes-snowball-has-disproven-climate-change-once-and-for-all/?utm_term=.a1d8326a5778) think that it means that holding up a snowball is proof that it's wrong.  They conflate ""weather"" and ""climate"" as it suits them.  In fairness, layman climate change advocates also sometimes make the same mistake in blaming a particular heat wave on climate change.  The shift to ""climate change"" does better describe the effects of global warming, which go beyond simply ""it's more hot"".  


One example I read was that in 2006, for the first time in recorded history Lake Erie didn't freeze.  That ended up resulting in GREATER lake-effect snow than usual because there was more moisture in the air.  I'm not saying that proves climate change, but it's just a possible example of the sort of consequence that CAN result that might not be as clear to describe as ""global warming"".   


I fucking hate the ""the climate changes naturally so we shouldn't do anything"" argument.  It's in bad faith.  It's like saying that the fucking Vancouver teen couldn't have started the Eagle Creek fire because forest fires happen naturally all the time.  Or ""I don't own lightbulbs because night happens all the time"".  The fact that weather and climate change is not evidence that mankind cannot influence it.  

&amp;#x200B;

And here's the thing:  people spouting that bullshit don't know what they're talking about. They aren't scientists.  You know how we know that the climate has undergone periods of heating and cooling over hundreds of thousands of years?  Because the same fucking people that are telling us that manmade CO2 emissions are altering the climate told us - climatologists.  It's absurd to think they haven't taken that into account.  Anyway, don't listen to me, listen to [goddamn NASA.](https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/)"

3994,"They are inherently not that safe to swim in anyway, due to things like fishing hooks, harmful bacteria levels, and various levels of pollution. Really not the best places to take a refreshing, clean swim most of the time. The Great Lakes region has also been found to be warming faster than the rest of the country, which isn‚Äôt good.

All the sediment at the bottom continuously adds up too. I know that Lake Erie in particular has big fall overturns (warm water cools in the fall, becomes more dense and sinks) where a large portion of the coast smells like dead fish, seaweed etc for days. Good stuff really. But hey, still an amazing resource of fresh water I guess.

Although they did have record water levels this year, which should continue to grow, but that of course fucks over the already eroding coastline. I would hate to have a lakefront cottage or something not back far enough at this point."
3995,"Dude Kelly‚Äôs sucks unless you‚Äôre super into hunting or you have a boat.

Beizeiten sah es in manchen Teilen der USA aus wie in Gebieten mit Raubtierkapitalismus wie man sie heute zbsp aus dem Niger-Delta oder Bangladesch kennt.

Ideales Beispiel ist der Cuyahoga River, der damals in den Lake Erie einspeiste. Die gro√üen Seen waren zu der Zeit Trinkwasserquelle f√ºr √ºber 20 Millionen Menschen. Seit der Industrialisierung brannte der Cuyahoga River mehr als ein dutzend Mal. Forscher an der Kent State beschrieben den Flu√ü damals so:
&gt;From 1,000 feet / 300 m below Lower Harvard Bridge to Newburgh and South Shore Railroad Bridge, the channel becomes wider and deeper and the level is controlled by Lake Erie. Downstream of the railroad bridge to the harbor, the depth is held constant by dredging, and the width is maintained by piling along both banks. The surface is covered with the brown oily film observed upstream as far as the Southerly Plant effluent. In addition, large quantities of black heavy oil floating in slicks, sometimes several inches thick, are observed frequently. Debris and trash are commonly caught up in these slicks forming an unsightly floating mess. Anaerobic action is common as the dissolved oxygen is seldom above a fraction of a part per million. The discharge of cooling water increases the temperature by 10 to 15 ¬∞F / 5.6 to 8.3 ¬∞C. The velocity is negligible, and sludge accumulates on the bottom. Animal life does not exist. Only the algae Oscillatoria grows along the piers above the water line. The color changes from gray-brown to rusty brown as the river proceeds downstream. Transparency is less than 0.5 feet / 0.15 m in this reach. This entire reach is grossly polluted"
4003,"There's waaaay too much opportunity to hide things where people wouldn't even know to look. Check it: the salt we put on the roads in the winter here in Ohio comes from a mine 1800 feet below Lake Erie. Yeah, 1800 feet blow a lake. If we can do that kind of shit just for salt, how much effort do you think those with government funds can go to hide some important shit?"

It could be water quantity (west and southwest shortages, midwest floods, etc.), water quality (degraded watersheds, TMDLs, like Chesapeake Bay for example), water utilities (water treatment, source water protection or development), wastewater treatment, stormwater (relates to several of the above), stream/wetland ecology, coastal engineering (which includes offshore drilling and such), and everything else.

I'm finding that recruiters look at my experience, and are really interested in me because water resources engineering experience isn't common. I've been called a ""unicorn,"" which is funny to me because obviously \*I\* know a bunch of water resources engineers. But, civil engineers in general are largely land development and structural, with the rest being much more niche-oriented and specialized.

""Omg treehuggers are trying to strangle business and competition!""  First up, it's liberals and the left that are calling for increased competition and enforcement of anti-trust law, and corporations that run crying to the government whenever new real competition appears.  Also, remember when Lake Erie was a dead zone and rivers caught fire, to say nothing of acid rain, air pollution and smog, or dumping of chemicals, coal mine tailings, and other shit in waterways without accountability?  I won't even bother with superfund sites.

-east ""coast"": with a minimum 5 hour drive to get to the ocean, I'd argue this is hardly a coastal ~~state~~city--although the rivers, Lake Erie's Presque Isle, and the numerous nearby freshwater lakes and reservoirs certainly make it an aquatic-friendly city!

-""healthy"": the Pittsburgh metro routinely gets ""F"" scores for air quality, we have more smokers per capita than most other U.S. cities, and our ""local food"" all emphasizes added fried food (french fries or pierogies) to already questionably healthy entrees (gigantic sandwiches, namely).

No one's going to read that Iran repeatedly said they had all drones accounted for, which means Trump is manipulating the media by repeatedly saying the same thing.

4033,"I learned this about southern ontario's carolinean region along lake erie. Historically a super rich deciduous rainforest, the soils were so rich that trees could easily grow to heights and girths similar to these massive coastal pacific trees. Due to clearing and agriculture those nutrients are gone and it would take thousands of years of forest growth for trees to even be able to grow to what they once were."
4034,"We could make things better? Buffalo by itself can't fix Lake Erie.

The problem is that Lake Erie is downstream from all of the other lakes. Eventually all the other shit that other cities put in the Great Lakes will end up in Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. It should come as no surprise that those two lakes are the most polluted.

Chicago is fine because they are upstream. Any shit that they dump in Lake Michigan is going to leave Lake Michigan.

This isn't about creative problem solving. This is about the reality that Lake Erie is fucked and gross and we can't solve that by ourselves (especially when federal funding is being cut)."
4035,"Not trying to make a direct comparison. I get it, Chicago is way bigger, Lake Erie is not as clean, that doesn't mean Buffalo can't build beaches in the future. I'm saying if there's future money allocated to improve the waterfront, it would be nice if they tried to prioritize a city beach."
4036,"I love the idea, but .... 

Unsafe pollutant and bacteria levels killed off a short-lived public beach at Times Beach in the 1950s.   The Buffalo River was essentially a sewer at the time, and Times Beach was too close to its mouth.  

Chicago never industrialized the shoreline north of the South Shore neighborhood.  The Lake Erie shoreline was solidly industrialized down to Hamburg.  South of that, most of the shoreline has private ownership.  There‚Äôs a few state parks, and a lot of town resident-only beaches, but the land just isn‚Äôt there for Chicago or Milwaukee-style lakefront parks.  

What about the NFTA land?  The breakwall stops most longshore sand flow that could accumulate for a beach.  Remove the breakwall, and you remove safe harbor for any boats ‚Äî lake freighters or bowriders ‚Äî in a storm.

NYS is VERY strict when it comes to managing waterbodies and hydrological resources. Even if there was a place for a groin to collect sand, it would be very difficult to build today, because it would alter Lake Erie‚Äôs natural shoreline.  Never mind that two centuries of industrial activity already altered it beyond recognition.

I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs impossible.  Im saying you‚Äôd have to get really, REALLY creative to get a Chicago-style lakefront in Buffalo.  Also, maybe wait a couple hundred years for total waterfront deindustrialization, land acquisition, financing. and waiting out the half-life of what‚Äôs in the muck."

4038,"I think you're still such looking at the past too apologetically. Every decade has its issues. You may not have been aware or had to deal with them, but they were there regardless. 

Just as an example, look at Lake Erie. Before the 80's you couldn't swim in it because of how polluted it was, how you can, but other things are messed up.

4046,"Pumped hydro is also lacking in sense of scale. Nobody's really tried to upgrade it to a big enough scale to provide all our energy storage needs, but eventually they will have to. It's easily got the potential to provide all the storage we need, it just needs some investment to make it happen. And once the demand and requirement for storage is there, I think the investment will quickly follow.

Lake Erie is already the biggest pumped storage reservoir in the world, but we only use the tiniest sliver of its actual capacity because there's no need for more, at least no need that anyone is willing to throw money at and there's a big tourist attraction in the way. The normal, natural variation range of Lake Erie's water level represents about 11 Terawatt-hours of stored energy. Enough capacity to power the entire world for over 6 months, without even pushing the lake beyond its normal shorelines, high or low. The generation and pumping capacity you would need would be enormous, but the physical capacity in the reservoir is easily available. The energy is being stored and released whether we choose to take advantage of it or not. Niagara Falls eats more hydroelectric energy every day than the entire world uses. It is certainly beautiful, and historically significant, but is it worth destroying the rest of the planet simply to avoid more completely harnessing that monster?

And that's just one of the lowest hanging fruit that I can think of. There are almost certainly other major options we could be taking advantage of, but that also refuse to consider for political or financial reasons."
4047,"&gt; Zebra mussels are **poisoning birds,** destroying human infrastructure and crowding out native mussel species, but in some places they're also creating healthier salmon, **by filtering (and visually clearing up) the water** in the lakes they've invaded . 

Zebra mussels poisoning birds is the result of the mussels having filtered and concentrated pollutants out of the water. You cite salmon being able to hunt more effectively through increased clarity of the water; but doesn't it go beyond that? I recall reading how the levels of pollutants in Lake Erie dropped drastically after Zebra mussels naturalized in the lake. With these pollutants removed from the water, doesn't that imply that they're not be taken up by other species (at least not in the quantities before the Zebra mussel infestation) --i.e. the zebra mussels are decreasing the uptake of pollutants in the native food chain by filtering and concentrating in the mussels?"

- City Government desperately want to rezone and develop residential/school stuff where the chemical plants are
- Chemical plants actually suddenly become good, discouraging the transaction. City government insists, eventually gets land.

There's no draft at the moment sure, but we're still sending our young to go die in the mountains, continuing the cycle of invasion and rebellion in the middle east.

Hey, you're right. That's what I get for going off memory

&gt; The plants are not beyond their operating life. The Perry plant hasn't hit it's original license expiration.

Again, I was thinking about Davis-Besse. Which did have it's original license run out. The NRC made 40 year operating licenses, because at the time, that was how long they thought they would run, hence the end-of-life comment.

However yes, they did just get a license renewal. Apparently, the NRC does believe that engineering advancements over the past 40 years means that they can continue operating them safely. But, IMO, the NRC is abdicating their regulatory duties here. According to the Wikipedia article (and the line is cited too), the NRC has determined that 2 of the 5 worst safety incidents have happened there. Given that it's a Gen 2 reactor and can't passively cool itself, the NRC IMO should be shutting this plant down to punish FirstEnergy, not giving them another 20 years to potentially fuck up Lake Erie and Northern Ohio with a reactor that has known design issues and is run by a shitty company.

Here's the list of incidents - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davis%E2%80%93Besse_Nuclear_Power_Station#Incident_history

The gulf of Mexico (basically my backyard) has the same issue with algae blooms leading to deceased fish since it loses oxygenation.

4079,"Lake Erie has this algae that lives in the lake, it is where we get most of our water. The Algae overproduced and made our water toxic for 2-3 days we thought it would be months before we got our water back because Red Cross was even here."
4080,"Yeah, I grew up on Lake Erie, which was declared ""dead"" in 1970."
4081,"I'm originally from NW Ohio and grew up on Lake Erie. Cyanobacteria and HABs (harmful algae blooms) have been a major problem in Lake Erie for most of the last decade and in the past couple of years has lead to water bans in communities around the lake. Cyanobacteria/HABs can harm people and pets and also kill marine and animal life, leading to dead zones.

As this article says, the blooms are caused by agricultural runoff (phosphorus specifically) and increased temperatures. Without getting super  weird and evangelical about it, toxic algae is increasingly becoming a problem nationwide and can/will impact people's ability to use outdoor waterspaces and access safe potable water. Talk to your elected representatives about it, ask them how they will work with the agricultural industry to reduce runoff, ask them to fund &amp; support research into HABs and protecting our waterways."
4082,"You forgot to mention Zebra Mussles which are also a known contributor, especially in Lake Erie."
4083,"Where I used to to work, has been non EPA compliant for almost a decade plus. Sometimes during rain storms they will dump a million gallons of rain water mixed with raw sewage in the west branch of the rocky river. Then into lake Erie. It's disgusting and the place is still doing it to this day."
4084,"They know their industry well because it's all they know from childhood, that's it. They aren't the smartest people on the planet. They vote for Trump because they don't like regulations that cost them money and they don't exactly care if it hurts the environment. They are just as much in a bubble as anyone else. They'll gladly take that subsidy because they feel they earned it but they also feel the poor family the ghetto doesn't. 

I live in Ohio and know many farmers. They aren't very well travelled, they don't like the new American culture. People are less religious, more sexual free, and more questioning of social norms. They don't like any of that. They want to turn back the clock to the 1950s when they didn't have to be uncomfortable and there were more people like themselves around.

They refuse to accept they are polluting Lake Erie, which has turned green with toxic algae from the increase of phosphorus from overfertilization. They blame the cities, they blame the sewage treatment plants. They shout fake news. Anything but taking any responsibility because, ""hey, I'm feeding you"". That's not smart."
4085,It indirectly killed 2 people by making them difficult to find as they were drowning in lake erie
4086,"Ah yes, because I've been wanting Lake Erie to get even filthier"
4087,"It‚Äôs a GREAT park. No; no mountain vistas or simmering cauldrons of volcanic mud. The Beaver Marsh hike is nice (former trash dump); Ledges Trail amazing (fabulous views and crevices to go through); Blue Hen Falls, fantastic. Stanford House is in the Park and is shared lodging. The history of the area is fascinating: Native Americans called the river: Cuyahoga- means crooked river. There‚Äôs a continental divide in Akron that turns the river north where it empties into Lake Erie; yes, it‚Äôs the one that caught fire. There are horseback riding trails, mountain biking trails and the towpath trail. 

Yes, the OHIO &amp; Erie Canal went through here and parts of the trails follow that path. The flood of 1913 ended the canal; however, the floods were due to storms that crossed the entire Midwest and ruined many communities. 

In Akron there is a marked path along the street called Portage Path; 50 bronze arrowheads mark the actual trail. In the Valley there‚Äôs a huge bronze Indian statue where they pulled their canoes out to portage them 8 miles to the Portage Lakes where they could get to the Tuscawarus River and eventually the Ohio. 

Stan Hywet is along Portage Path in Akron. It was built in 1913-15 by the Seiberling family who founded Goodyear. 65,000 sq ft mansion with 28 fireplaces, indoor swimming pool, fantastic gardens, birch allee and glass conservatory. The pipe organ in the music room has pipes that are 3 stories tall. It opens April 1 each year. Seiberling‚Äôs grandson helped create Cuyahoga Valley National Park. 

If you go into downtown Akron, Lock 3 has a Children‚Äôs Museum and ice skating in the winter; concerts in the summer. If you go on the trail behind the Rubber Ducks baseball stadium there is an outline of a towpath barge that is outlined in metal. It gives a great idea of what travel was like. 

Summit Metro Parks co-manages some of the trails like Deep Lock Quarry. It‚Äôs where they got a lot of the stone for the locks. The Mustill Store is in Akron and along the Towpath Trail. It‚Äôs one of the earliest stores still around. 

The Conservancy for Cuyahoga Valley National Park partners with the National Park and provides lots of great programming. They‚Äôve helped fund a new visitors center soon to be open. W
Hen government shutdowns occur, programming still happens through the Conservancy. 

Boston Mills is a small town in the middle of the National Park. At one point, the bank there had the highest deposits of any bank in the US. The gas station is now an art venue.

4088,"What you describe is the tragedy of the commons, and the free rider problem as well. Which is why individualist solutions are not going to be effective. 

If a person volunteers to go Green. Then they are a free rider trying to solve the problem of global warming, which is a tragedy of the commons. Going green is the social martyrdom of the people who's work indirectly supports those who refuse to solve the problem. Such that by doing nothing you are better of than people who are doing something as long as someone is doing something. So it would be more economical for individuals to do nothing and let others pay for the cost. 

This is why we tax pollution. Because global warming is an externality and all costs must be paid eventually. The discussion of individual accountability is pointless. We need enforcement to ensure that we don't rely upon free riders, and to limit damage done through the tragedy of the commons exploiting them. It is not an individualist problem, it's not even limited to a single nation either. It's a global crisis. Right now nations are playing a game of brinkmanship with the future of the world because few nations want to be a free rider. 

An excellent example of the problem is the history of the Great Lakes and pollution. To which the largest sources of fresh water in the world has been polluted to the point of making lake Erie and Michigan dying seas. The lakes were free places to dump waste. With just a small amount of waste there was no problem and no need to enforce anything. However over time there were more and more sources of pollution. Too many for the lakes to manage for us all for free. If we let keeping the lakes alive be voluntary, then they would be dead by now because that situation was what allowed the problem to develop and not resolve itself in the first place. Even now they aren't doing that much better off about 50 years after Nixon, but at least they aren't entirely dead. 

My argument is that enforced action is required and that's all that will be effective. Voluntary action is going to be ineffective. Because at this point in this problem there are too many individuals exploiting the free ride of the earth's temperature management."
4089,"As others have said, it is good park but not worth the drive to see it alone. Some cools areas include the ledges, tow path trail (hiking &amp; biking), Brandywine falls &amp; some other falls (blue hen, buttermilk, etc) along with the train. Two days tops should be more than enough to cover everything worthwhile. The main reason it became a national park was to prevent development from happening. I would pair it with other stuff such as maybe Hocking hills, Cleveland/stuff along lake Erie, Niagara falls, &amp; stuff in Pennsylvania (not too familiar with it but I know there as some great areas like ohiopyle &amp; also a dark sky area somewhere in the North Central part of the state &amp; another place called the Grand canyon of the east?)

Also as far at a place to stay, there are numerous hotels in the surrounding communities. There are no places to camp in the park itself."
4090,No doubt but also 2 fisherman died way out in Lake Erie because all those ballons caused a flying hazard for the Coast Guard to rescue them.
4091,"They are less screwed than before but still in an awful position. Continued rampant corruption in politics, high city taxes, second highest violent crime rate in the nation (2017), and regular toxic algae blooms in Lake Erie/Lake St. Claire. That's just the tip of the iceberg."
4092,I'm 50 and as a kid I'd eat fish from lake Erie all the time ( mostly walleye) nowadays you couldn't pay me to eat anything that came out of that lake .
4093,"**Cuyahoga River**

The Cuyahoga River ( KY-…ô-HOG-…ô, or  KY-…ô-HOH-g…ô) is a river in the United States, located in Northeast Ohio, that runs through the city of Cleveland and feeds into Lake Erie. As Cleveland emerged as a major center for manufacturing, the river became heavily affected by industrial pollution, so much so that it ""caught fire"" at least 13 times, most famously on June 22, 1969, helping to spur the American environmental movement. Since then, the river has been extensively cleaned up through the efforts of Cleveland's city government and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA).

4094,"Do you think that business have a right to pollute the air you breathe and the water you drink causing millions of additional government dollars spent to pay for the filtration of these pollutants? 

I live by Lake Erie and the water is full of green toxic algae every summer due to the lake being high in phosphorus from overfertilization run off and other pollutants. This is the water supply for millions of people in the area and the issue is so bad that it's a nearly a billion dollar issue in upgrading a single water treatment plant. Local communities continue to bear the costs of large agriculture and industrial waste being dumped into our water supply. 

Why is clean air and water not a conservative issue? And why do you not want additional federal protections from bad business practices that literally poison your body?"

4100,"It is. We have other interests as well though. We like basketball, baseball, and long walks on the fish carcass covered Lake Erie beaches as well as Browns football."
4101,"That rings true to me, and I have a theory as to why.

The 90's were a pseudo-magical time between the fall of the Berlin Wall and the fall of the Twin Towers. America faced no existential threats - or really any major threats. The economy was pretty good, the environment was getting better, and crime was remarkably low.

The 70's, in contrast, were a pseudo-hellscape, when America was finally giving up on Vietnam, with no sign that the USSR was going away anytime soon. The president resigned in disgrace. The country seemed to face existential threats on all fronts. The economy was a mess - people were paying credit card-level rates on *mortgages*. The Great Lakes were so polluted that one of them actually caught on fire. Crime was *unbelievably* high.

In short, the 70's were a scary time, but they proved to be much more dramatic and interesting than the 90's; and therefore provided better subject material for movies of all kinds.

Edit: Lake Erie actually caught fire in 1969. Not the 70's, but still ..."
4102,"It's a 240 mile long, 40-50 mile wide lake. The Western end is much shallower.  Prevailing winds are predominantly W/NW/N/NE.  So the average prevailing wind has at least 45 miles of fetch to push water into the shallows of the Cleveland area. You may get 20 foot swells in an ocean but with 100'-200' between 'em.  When the wind pipes up on Erie, you can have 6'-8' swells with 12'-20' between 'em.   The difference is wavelength and frequency dictated by the depth of the water.   The ocean may give you a gentle feeling of floating up on on a wave, into the trough, then up on the other side in a very smooth motion. Lake Erie though can be like being in a washing machine.  I cringe seeing open jon boats 4 miles off shore, no life jackets, bouncing up and down on the waves.  One errant wave and the boat will flip (I think most have flotation compartments, but still).

As for recreational boater traffic, though it's a lot of fun on Labor Day (Air Show) and July 4th fireworks on the lake, the drunk to sober ratio peaks during those times and boat traffic can get nuts.  I stay away from the lake on those two days. 

On the plus side, drive your boat directly North on a summer night. Keep going till Cleveland drops out of sight and there's nothing but stars and a faint glow to the South.  It's magic."
4103,"Polluted agricultural runoff¬†is the leading source of¬†water pollution¬†in rivers, lakes and well water. The pesticides in runoff can seep into people's water supply when using well water. The runoff¬†can also build up in fish, which can expose people who eat the fish to high levels of chemicals. Polluted agricultural runoff can also trigger harmful algae blooms in coastal waters. 

In the 2000 National Water Quality 
Inventory, states reported that agricultural nonpoint source (NPS) pollution is the leading source of water quality impacts on surveyed rivers and lakes, the second largest source of impairments to wetlands, and a major contributor to contamination of surveyed estuaries and ground water. In fact,¬†Lake Erie‚Äôs 2014 algae bloom¬†left more than 400,000 residents of Toledo, Ohio without drinking water for three days."
4104,"ok, over the last 5ish years, even when i was drinking heavily every day, i used to try to go on tinder dates sober. we didnt go to bars or anything of course, that wouldnt have made sense. i usually tried to convince girls to grab lunch with me, or coffee, and some of the best were convincing them to go on a bike ride with me - my friend always let me borrow her bike for this purpose. i love riding bikes and i cant recommend that kind of date enough, especially if you live somewhere you can pick the person up, then drive to a parking spot to unload bikes and ride down a path to go grab a bite to eat in a few miles of riding. Then ride a little bit more and take a break to sit down and talk on a bench or wherever (i had a grassy incline along the bike path id always love to stop and sit at and look at the city skyline). Then ride home, give her a hug or kiss goodnight. Excellent date. I highly recommend. Even when i was drinking 1.5L of vodka every day, i still went on dates sober (the problem was leaving the date and driving to the liquor store and going home with a bottle afterward - thats the part that needs left behind).

Another fun sober date i had was along lake erie, there is a wetlands area along the water w/ boardwalk trails. we went on a walk and checked out the local wildlife, enjoyed views of the wetlands and the lake at other points, it was great. this was also while i was drinking heavily, but i was sober until i dropped her off after that. great experience, again, just need to cut out the alcohol use afterward

I did do plenty of drunk dates within that time period too, They actually always failed. I never once saw a girl again after a drunken night w/ a girl i met on tinder, and that happened maybe 7 or 8 times in the past 5 years.

the point of telling these stories is that sober dates are BETTER, and i hope all of you guys here arent worried about having to do sober dates now after stopping drinking. The sober dates are the good dates!"
4105,"So, I can smell Lake Erie from these stairs and it's not making me very happy ü§¢"
4106,"&gt;Further, the coverage is touting ‚Äúpollutant‚Äù in laymen‚Äôs terms without elaborating on what the CWA treats as a pollutant. They make it seem as if a pollutant is always some form of a dangerous chemical. 

I didn't get that impression, but I also studied environmental science and the CWA specifically and understand how impactful pollutants like excess sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorus are to aquatic ecosystems. 

&gt;Most pollutants that end up falling under the term are gravel, rocks, dirt, sand, or other sediment that are adjacent to the ‚Äúwater way‚Äù anyway. Certain rock and gravel is often used for land loss prevention as a protection for further erosion. 

Just because they are useful in some areas doesn't mean they aren't incredibly harmful in other areas. Wetlands aren't high erosion zones like river banks or shorelines, and the deposition of sediment will fill in wetlands over time and smother plants. Remediation for this is *insanely* expensive and is often too little too late. The is a reason that the watersheds for the Chesapeake Bay all have TMDLs for sediment: it is a pollutant of major concern even if it won't directly make you sick. Other ""not scary chemicals"" like excess nutrients are extremely disruptive and damaging for aquatic ecosystems like wetlands.

So it's true that ""pollutant"" doesn't necessarily refer to things like lead but that doesn't mean that we shouldn't be concerned about the impact the changes will have on wetlands.

&gt;There are contaminated and polluted ‚Äúwetlands‚Äù across the US that are waiting to be remediated, but the landowners either can‚Äôt secure the proper permit from the Army Corp of Engineers or have to spend millions of additional dollars to appease the ACE‚Äôs and EPA‚Äôs supervision requirements and clean up specifications.  

What landowners are trying to spend tens to hundreds of thousands remediating wetlands but being stopped by regulations? Even if that is a problem, there are other ways to go about addressing it than rolling back protections like this. I guarantee you that there are far more land owners looking to develop and pollute wetlands."
4107,"I was out on Lake Erie this summer, and the smell is shockingly calming.

4108,"Fishfly. Mayfly. June bug.

4109,**Breaking** due to excess salt runoff Lake Erie officially declared to be an ocean.
4110,While I sit here staring at Lake Erie in Ohio in which you cannot see two inches in front of your face.
4111,Lack of regulation also caused lake Erie to catch on fire. So there's that.
4112,"The only thing I can think of is the algae blooms in Lake Erie, although that isn't near the Columbus area. I've heard it called ""Toxic algae blooms"" due to the type of algae producing a type of toxin. The algae itself is a problem, and is caused by pollution (farm run off). Maybe this is what they were talking about? Even if that is the case, it wouldn't effect you in the Columbus area."
4113,"Look at swoll Lake Erie basically taking the place of all of modern Ohio. Also Michigan apparently stole the naming rights of Lake Illinois.

4119,100% agree. I hate seeing Lake Erie get worse every year yet nothing is done about the over-fertilization.
4120,"There's more to environmental impact than just greenhouse gases. 
mono cropping degrades the soil, at this rate we're headed for another dust bowl. If the soil dies we all starve.  Fertilizer runoff is causing toxic algae blooms. Toledo ohio couldn't drink the tap water for a few days last year because of a toxic algae bloom in lake erie. An algae bloom caused by agricultural runoff."
4121,"FWIW, Harbor Beach is on the Lake Huron side of the thumb &amp; the water is every bit as clear &amp; wild as Lake Michigan. Lake Erie got extremely clear until the kelp started overgrowing, which kickstarted the algae with the massive fertilization assistance of over 800 under-the-radar factory farms in its western basin..."
4122,"While Dr. Ehrlick May have been a kook, the underlying, and less extreme, issues were very real.  And you know what, we did stuff about it.  The EPA, clean air act et al. all served to change our ecological trajectory from what it had been up to the early 70‚Äôs.

Are you familiar with how the Cuyahoga river literally caught on fire, or how badly pollution was affecting Lake Erie?  

We realized that stuff like this was a problem and did stuff to fix it.

Similarly for the ‚Äúpopulation bomb‚Äù idea - we realized it was a problem and put a lot of development effort into increasing agricultural output (the green revolution).  If there hadn‚Äôt been those advances, or they hadn‚Äôt been deployed worldwide, we would not have been able to sustain the population growth that had occurred over the last 50(ish) years.

The difference now is that we‚Äôre in the middle of a big problem, and can‚Äôt see good solutions to address climate change or how its effects will play out."

4124,"I see the Ohio River almost every day, I‚Äôve seen it flooded, I‚Äôve seen it at pool, I‚Äôve definitely seen trash but it‚Äôs absolutely nothing in comparison to this.  I also grew up on Lake Erie.  It‚Äôs got a little trash too like anyplace but you obviously haven‚Äôt seen either in person."
4125,"They can't drive. They think they are better than us, even though they are below us among a million other reasons. They come to our state to see it's beauty, and leave it all mucked about. They dirty lake Erie worse than Detroit. When we have to leave our beautiful state we have to drive through Ohio and keep our windows up in order to avoid the smell, plus the first thing we see is... Toledo... Then there is the whole college football deal. Nothing good has come out of that state. Worth a second mention, they can't drive. Sorry, not sorry."
4126,Maybe it‚Äôs because I live close to Lake Erie and Ontario. They are definitely the most boring and not the cleanest. I agree there are some cool natural features around the other lakes. I recently did a roadtrip in Northern Ontario and loved the northern shore of Superior. Definitely worth seeing.
4127,Maybe people near Lake Erie will be fine because that‚Äôs basically all algae. The tap water from near Lake Erie even tastes like algae.
4128,Scary to think about when Lake Erie is fucking gross. Really need to start cracking down on pollution...
4129,"I know exactly where you are coming from and I disagree with that line of thought so I replied in jest.  I assume you believe they constitutionally wrong to do so because of the 10th amendment?  In my opinion the commerce clause (Art. 1, section 8) allows the federal government to regulate environmental standards as one State's lack of standards could impact the well being of another State.  For example, Michigan decides to just dump everything and anything into the Detroit River/Lake Erie.  Michigan doesn't care, they only have a small portion of Lake Erie in their border.  But Ohio, PA, NY, and Ontario do care because this affects their fishing and tourism economies.  The federal government needs to come in and set a universal standard that appeases all states and a foreign entity.  

Now the commerce clause has been strengthened over the centuries by the courts, and you may disagree with that, but as we are a common law country, their rulings shape the law today.  You may also feel that the executive should not have the power to solely enact federal environmental regulation.  I agree, but since Congress has steadily been giving up their power to the executive over the last century, you have to work with what you got.  I would love if Congress took back from power from the executive, but given the train wreck that is DC, I doubt that will happen anytime soon. 

Since environmental standards are extremely important, and impacts the economy, well-being, and general welfare of all people and States, it must be the role of the federal government to set a standard, and the states may enforce a higher standard per the 10th amendment."
4130,Ahh you can see the surging rush of phosphorus being carried through into Lake Erie.
4131,"1) Most of the issues with water quality we have had historically stemmed from agriculture and animal husbandry. In regions without that, water would be ""clean"" barring mineral contamination, which would be a thing even without agriculture and such

2) Once the Industrial Revolution rolled around, industry polluting water sources is also a thing. You can't drink from Lake Erie because uncountable amounts of factories, industries and even runoff from streets and the like runs into it.

3) Then there are microbial sources that, while they won't kill you, can make you ill if you aren't used to them. ""Montezuma's Revenge"", for example. The water is ""safe to drink"", but since your body isn't used to it, you get sick

What does this have to do with your question?

Keep in mind that in many, if not most cases, including ""modern wilderness survival"", if you are dying of dehydration and dont have a way to purify water...... just drink the water. Dehydration will kill you faster than most contaminants will, and most water-borne ailments can be treated (to various degrees) back in ""civilization"". Historically, water-borne diseases killed *a lot* of people, and many people had parasites."
4132,"Shouldn't the colors be a kind of Sludge Green to simulate the Algae Bloom that we get from Lake Erie that affects our drinking water? Around my area, people fondly call it Zombie Water."
4133,"Lake Huron rolls, Superior sings, in the ruins of her ice-water mansion.

Old Michigan steams like a young man‚Äôs dreams, the islands and bays are for sportsmen.

4134,"Cool, that sounds like a fun class. Anyway, I'd recommend not thinking about it as a veganism = bad for the environment carnivore = good, because its not that simple. If people want to do what is best for the environment then that is going to mean buying local as that will minimize the amount of energy required to get that food from the farm to your plate. 

The thing is that its very hard to do a vegan diet by just eating locally grown plants, especially for certain parts of the year. 

In addition to the energy required to farm, there is also the problem of run-off from fertilizer on farms that can harm the ecosystem. For example Lake Erie has been dealing with this problem lately. The rain comes and washes the fertilizer and such into the water system which goes into lake erie, lake erie then has a boom of nitrogen which causes a spike in the algae population which makes the water toxic to a lot of the native species and can make the water undrinkable. Specifically this year Toledo's water was not drinkable for a period of time. 

Now that is a problem with farming practices in general, not with a vegan diet in particular. A lot of plants grown in the US go to animal feed or to energy production, especially most of the corn in the midwest. 

Do what you will but I'd focus on making the argument that the vegan philosophy places minimizing animal suffering above human health and environmental health. And then make the argument that minimizing animal suffering and improving environmental health are at times at odds with each other, enter arguments for ruminant animals on pastures helping trap carbon in the soil and whatnot. If you really want to go after veganism. 

But as I said before, as for the environment its about buying local. But [according to this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/13/dining/fruit-vegetables-imports.html) over half of fruit and a third of vegetables come from outside the US. The article also states that over 80% of seafood is imported. Based on this, its going to be hard to just luck into a vegan diet that doesn't involve shipping produce from around the world just to feed them."
4135,"I was an environmental consultant for 14 years at both big and small firms. I hated every moment of it. If I had known that was one of the main career paths I'd be able to have then I would have chosen a different major in college. I never met a single other geologist who actually liked the work, other than the few who were all about the business side of things and becoming a Sr VP. Not saying there's no geo's who actually like it but I never met one. I just never wanted to do ""dirty water"" work; investigating and remediating contaminated sites. I was always more into natural resource stuff, so I busted my ass and made a career pivot to doing just that for a county transportation department. I deal with landslides, flooding, fish passage, removal/fill in water of the US/state, beaver issues, hydrology, invasive plants, storm water/NPDES compliance, TMDLs, erosion issues, permitting for large transportation projects, and whatever other environmental issues come up. I do something different every day. Don't have to worry about being billable or timesheets. Have a pension and retirement account. Plenty of sick and vacation days. Can work just 40 or as much overtime as I want. It took a long time and a lot of hard work but I'm finally doing something that doesn't make me regret getting into geology and environmental science. Check your local government agencies and their environmental departments. Might be something more suited to you there. Hard to get into, but can be a nice career."

A guy I know who owns a gun store had a guy call and say he found a wooden box with German writing on it... Opens it up and has an MG42 with spare barrels and the asbestos gloves in there.  Guy wanted to know what to do with it and the gun store owner told him call the ATF on a burner phone and see if they'll allow him to register.  If not ""drop it"" while on a fishing trip in Lake Erie or donate it.

The finder guesses his dad (WWII vet) saw it on a truck in Germany towards the end of the war all those back and wanted a keepsake."
4138,"Well, if you pollute in say, a pond and compare that same amount of pollutant to where Detroit is, on Lake Erie/St. Clair, the pollutant will be significantly diluted. Also the US government has been cleaning up the Great Lakes for a while now, tons of money are being poured into cleaning the lakes up."
4139,"Ok, cool. Now let's talk about big engine cars, industrial plants, hydrogen bomb testing, oil spills, and the Lake Erie fire."
4140,"There are some groups that are looking into how the great lakes will be affected. They are made up of melted glacier seperated off from oceans, so the current melting glaciers that are rising the sea level wont directly impact it. That isnt to say that the great lakes wont be impacted my climate change. One of the big concerns they will face has to do with what's already there, like toxic algae. This is already to start to effect places like Toledo as the shallower and warmer the water gets the more it spreads. This can eventually lead to dead zones in the lake if it is left unchecked (worst case totally negligent scenario). Flooding will also become an issue with heavier and longer lasting rains, just last summer  this has already led to beaches being washed out and issues with growing crops as fields are too flooded to grow anything.


I have heard that part if the reason the beaches got washed out was due to underestimating rain levels, lake Erie's level is controlled by how much water flows out of Niagara."
4141,"That's why we're all here. There aren't any docks for us to meet at in the middle of the night. (If y'all wanna come up to Lake Erie, that's fine, but it smells like shit. Local fried perch is damn good regardless.)"
4142,"I did. And the average temperature is increasing.

Edit: Also the oldest ice cores are 800,000 years. Smarty pants.

Edit2: Seriously? Do you understand how the stock market works? There are ‚Äúswings‚Äù all the fucking time but the average value goes up for those successful companies.

Edit3: Also, we haven‚Äôt lived during a time of ‚Äúextreme‚Äù swings hence we‚Äôre not in an ice age or earth on fire (literally) situation but as the average temperature increases the ice ages will shorten and the times of extreme heat increase. The difference is after humans the temperatures began to rise faster. You should know from the ice core information you‚Äôve reviewed. The average temperature of the earth is increasing. You may think only one degree on average isn‚Äôt a big deal but it is. As an example one degree increase in lake temperatures, in this case Lake Erie, means water doesn‚Äôt get as cold during the winter and does not freeze as thoroughly as in the past. The ice that does form thaws more quickly, evaporates more readily, and dumps a fuck ton of rain on Buffalo more than any other times. Have you ever heard of the ‚Äúocean conveyor belt‚Äù? Look it up and explain to me why it‚Äôs beginning to slow down.

This issue is bigger than ‚Äúthere are swings all the time.‚Äù Don‚Äôt be the dumb person that settles on what Trump tells you.

Change your buying habits. Eat local food, cook it yourself. Don't support factory farming of animals. Don't buy heavily sprayed foods which are currently ruining Lake Erie's blue algae, reducing the oxygen in the environment. Donate some money to other people developing solutions to climate change. Don't shop at stores that bring in everything from overseas or from thousands of miles away, stop buying so much ""crap"" that you don't even need... This is like 1% of the list I could write.

Saturday Night Live did the ""Land Shark"" skits, the opening bass notes (duh-dunt, duh dunt) of Williams' score became synonymous with something bad about to happen, more shark movies and books were made... you wouldn't have Shark Week if it weren't for Jaws.

4157,"After 10 years in The Trades, and 10 years of EMS/Fire, I needed something interesting and challenging. A friend who works line clearance told me The Orange team was hiring and I sent in an application only to get snapped up by a General Foreman from another yard. At 47 and a former environmental activist, the younger guys didn‚Äôt/don‚Äôt like that I go to work to WORK. I applied myself to learning the line clearance specs and transitioning from rock climbing techniques to arborists closed system DRT/Blake‚Äôs hitch with gaffs climbing. Took me 7 months to become a foreman and get my own truck. A lot of the young guys who had been there for 2+ years resented my advancement. When I asked what was holding them back I got excuses and them blaming their foremen. ‚ÄúThe CDL test is too hard. My foreman won‚Äôt sign my book.‚Äù As much time as they spend finger fucking their phones and standing around rather than working, I wouldn‚Äôt advance them either. 
YOU gotta make it happen for you. Watch all the videos you can find. The Educated Climber is awesome. Read all the arborists climbing books you can find. ISA testing can‚Äôt happen till you‚Äôve got 3 years in the industry so learn the work first, then go for credentials. 
Substance abuse is RAMPANT. Stay sober. Fuck those guys who smoke pot at work or do coke or crack or drink. You gotta keep a clear head. If you end up on a stoned/drunk crew, get away from it. Save that stuff for after work. Or not at all. CDL means lower tolerance for blood alcohol levels and I haven‚Äôt heard how pot has played out with it yet. 
This work will challenge you. Limb walking is a rush. Sailing big shit rocks. The technical stuff is sweet. Hitch climber, ascenders, rope wrench, porter-wraps. There‚Äôs so much stuff out there to make the work easier and safer. Make friends with folks who have/use the stuff. Don‚Äôt settle for cowboy bullshit and half measures. The work is awesome. Being 70‚Äô up in a bucket with 35 mph winds at 22 deg F will keep you focused. Blowing the top out of a leaner 50‚Äô off the ground (aren‚Äôt many super tall trees along our section of Lake Erie) will blow your mind. I nearly shit my pants the first time.

You‚Äôre right, I don‚Äôt deny that fact, that‚Äôs why it is listed on the MLS and with an actual agent. 

Allow me to share my theory.

I love the fact that everyone quotes these TV shows, before they take the time to actually evaluate and think about the various types of disasters folks are prepping for. Not everyone is prepping for of ‚Äúeconomic collapse‚Äù or ‚Äúbreak down of society and law and order‚Äù again TV words. 

But perhaps some are prepping for that environmental disaster, that is looming, you know global warming, melting ice caps, rising sea and ocean levels, maybe some are already living it, such as those folks behing flooded out on a weekly basis at the Lake Ontario and Lake Erie areas. But they need a second option, or maybe they need a waypoint between locations.  

Or perhaps they need an area that is between 1800 to 2000 feet above sea level, and an area with a variety of farms both vegetable and animal from with one may choose to barter with, and also wild life again both plant animal and fungi, then perhaps it will make sense. Not to mention some dangerous roads during inclement weather

As for the close to ‚Äúlarge population centers,‚Äù lol I love that phrase, most preppers don‚Äôt got the funds to prep, therefore they need those large population centers to keep their jobs, while considering that they need a bug out location that is within 200 to 300 miles from that city center, because that‚Äôs the average mileage per tank of ‚Äúfuel‚Äù in every vehicle in America, but who fills up their tanks anyways right. 

So considering the natural resources, distance from the interstate, and major roadways, inaccessibility of certain areas, mountain passes, and farmers- ‚ÄòMercia loves us our farmers, cause most of us have not got a single green thumb in our body much less our families. 

So yes your theory is extremely feasibly, but that doesn‚Äôt deny the fact that people still live in New York State, oh and by the way, considering that every state has a lock down procedure for their borders currently, well my theory is a feasible one also."

4178,"They're referring to the Flint Water Crisis where for upwards of 2-3 years the residents' water was tainted with lead.  This was due to a terrible decision by a team appointed by the states Governor to change their water supply from Lake Erie to the Flint river to save money.  The river water caused the lead pipes in the city to errode and thus pipe toxic waste levels of lead into hundreds of homes.  On top of that for over a year the state government kept insisting the water was safe.  That's why the headline is so selatious, there is a history of the state gov fucking them over."
4179,"**Cuyahoga River**

The Cuyahoga River ( KY-…ô-HOG-…ô, or  KY-…ô-HOH-g…ô) is a river in the United States, located in Northeast Ohio, that runs through the city of Cleveland and feeds into Lake Erie. As Cleveland emerged as a major center for manufacturing, the river became heavily affected by industrial pollution, so much so that it ""caught fire"" at least 13 times, most famously on June 22, 1969, helping to spur the American environmental movement. Since then, the river has been extensively cleaned up through the efforts of Cleveland's city government and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA).

It then encourages the overgrowth of this type of Cyanobacteria in the drainage ponds and water features surrounding those courses. It‚Äôs a similar phenomenon to what happens with Lake Erie, albeit on a smaller scale. Frankly I wouldn‚Äôt live next to a golf course. Most of the ponds near them are bright green in the spring/summer - at least around here.

We were born into the expectation of a full nuclear exchange between Russia and the US. 

&gt;In my elementary school from the first grade to the fifth we practiced getting under our desk when the civil defense sirens or a planned bell went off every couple of months.

CBS‚Äôs news anchor Walter Cronkite and his like had scientist on once a week (we all watched the news, it was terrifying fun) telling us that the increase in population was unsustainable. We pppsaw tapes of people already starving by the millions in India, and China was worse. Soon the whole world could be starving as the population reached unsustainable numbers. Civilization itself would collapse before the year 2000 as starving immigrants flooded the first world countries.

Pollution in the US was as bad as China today. Lead was thick in the air and contaminated rivers were catching on fire. In 1970, the great Lake Erie was declared dead, void of all life due to pollution.

Not as bad as the 1966 headline of the prestigious Time Magazine asking a very religious nation in a hopeless time, ‚ÄúIs God Dead‚Äù?

The Ozone hole was in there somewhere, at point X it would kill us all.

Not a lot of assassinations today, but:

A President was shot in 1963, Malcom X in 65, Kennedy and MLK in 1968. Multiple riots burned big inner cities to the ground and the political wars made today look like a pillow fight.

The 1970‚Äôs economy was a cluster. Inflation over 10%, mortgages higher than 15%, no chance we were ever going to have it as easy as out parents. The President had a serious speech and said the country was in a malaise.

In 1977 I learned the World was going to completely run out of oil by the year 2000. No tractors gas to feed the starving in America , no cars, no 18 wheelers to distribute food. In the real world gasoline lines were over 2 hours long. When we are out of gas in 2000 Societies would collapse, yada yada you know the drill.

Now we learn just a few big Nukes will cause a worldwide nuclear winter. Human Extinction possible.

Jump forward only because I‚Äôm tired. 

The Aids virus was devastating. It would soon kill heterosexuals at the same rate per 1000 as it was killing Homosexuals. If you have been with multiple people you are possibly already infected. Being diagnosed was a certain death sentence, and like we hear with Coronavirus, when critical mass is hit in the heterosexual community we will run out of people, care facilities and body bags to comfort and bury the dying.

The Y2K predictions were from disaster to apocalyptic.

You get my drift. Coronavirus is real. Climate change is real, but we have been crawling under the desk waiting for the bomb to fall since the first day we can remember.

The 1960‚Äôs-70‚Äôs American pollution apocalypse. The US air was like China‚Äôs today. Lake Erie was declared dead to all life and chemicals caught rivers caught on fire. We probably all had cancer

The world will have absolutely no more oil by 2000 apocalypse. Not for cars, 18 wheelers, not for tractors. Civilizations will collapse 

We were told when the HIV virus has critical mass in the straight community like it did in the 1980‚Äôs gay communities tens of millions would die each year. (a 100% death sentence if infected.) (millions in Africa/Asia did die)

China‚Äôs a developing economy just like India. I‚Äôm not going to debate income inequalities so don‚Äôt turn it into that, but developing countries need the money.

What‚Äôs your air conditioning set at in the summer months? Ever feel the need to bundle up under a blanket on a hot July evening? Summer brownouts are less common than they used to be but they still happen.

4198,"People rail on the boomers, but the boomers spent billions cleaning up problems left to us by the prior generations.  Superfund sites, ozone holes, leaded gas, catalytic converters, asbestos, all paid for by the boomers to clean up the environment. The rivers feeding lake Erie used to catch on fire, they were so polluted."
4199,"The Legend of Hell‚Äôs Gates

The area of Lake Erie from Long Point to close to Port Stanley, Ontario,  holds many dark tales.  During the War of 1812, American raiders came from all directions to pillage, burn and loot.  From the Grand River to Point Pelee they left a deep psychological impact on the people and the land, so much so that even today no major Canadian city exists on the north shore of Lake Erie, in direct contrast to the large American cities on the south shore of the Lake.

	One grim lake tale plays out around a thickly tree-lined country lane near ‚ÄúSaulter‚Äôs Gulley‚Äù which runs off the Nova Scotia Line between Port Bruce and Port Burwell, beside the pioneer cemetery of Grovesend. The lane ran down to the high cliffs overlooking Lake Erie.  Halfway down the lane one can still see the mysterious 1870's ‚Äútraffic circle‚Äù.  At the end of the lane, perched a mansion close to the cliff edge a little past two huge stone gates. These gates would become commonly called ‚ÄúHell‚Äôs Gates‚Äù; they were ‚ÄúThe Entrance to Hell‚Äù because so many who dared go through them would disappear, never to be seen again.  With time and erosion, the mansion crumbled into the lake, leaving only the gates  which stood for many years, until more time and more erosion claimed them, too.

	For many years I talked to locals and heard several versions of this story, an though they vary from person to person, the basic elements stayed true.   However the origin of the intense fear of the place took me many years to track down, and the answer came from an older man who wished to remain anonymous.   While I can never prove conclusively what I am to tell you, I personally feel satisfied with the origin of ‚ÄúHell‚Äô Gates‚Äù.

	Around the crumbling mansion and the Gates grew a local Unrequited Love and Ghost story which itself gave way to many versions, depending on who was doing the story telling.  The basic ‚Äústory‚Äù is, I believe, is founded on an actual 1870's conflict within a local  church congregation resulting in  a bitter split among its members.  The Split was solved when the church burned; some of the day called it arson. Two new churches were built to accommodate the arguing factions, one on the original site with its original graveyard, a new one on a new site with a new graveyard.  Although one of the churches are gone, the cemeteries still exist, but for historical note, neither of these two cemeteries are the Grovesend cemetery. 

&amp;#x200B;

	 Also divided were the families of the original congregation, two in particular.  A young woman from one group and a young man from the other group were in love. She was forbidden to see him again.  (1)With broken heart, she flung herself off the cliff near the mansion, to her death.  Or (2) She was killed by the jilted lover she was forced to leave.  The motive for her death is also subject to debate,  some local folklore  claiming she was in a ‚Äúfamily way.‚Äù  She was, factually,  laid to rest in neither of the newer cemeteries but the original pioneer cemetery beside Saulter‚Äôs Gully/ Grovesend, which, to this day, according to continuing reports, she haunts, wandering in sorrow.  

	Others say it‚Äôs not her sobbing from the cemetery that they hear, but her lover moaning deep into the night as he  trods up and down along Saulter‚Äôs Gully, just as he did in life, in the dark of the night so as not to be seen, long into his old age, his guilt bearing down on him both in life and since, in death.   The fact that she was not buried in either of the newer church operated cemeteries, or what could be seen as ‚Äúhallowed ground‚Äù  lends support that some something terrible happened and this was far from a natural death.

Today the long lane to the cliff edge where the mansion once stood is blocked by a wide gate and a large ‚ÄúNo Trespassing‚Äù sign which is kept in good repair.

	During the American Prohibition years, circa 1920-1933, this Unrequited Love/Ghost story was given a different twist and took on a new life.  Added to the mournful lovers haunting Saulter‚Äôs Gulley was a ghostly apparition whose face could be seen in the bark of a large trees near the mysterious ‚Äútraffic circle‚Äù halfway down the lane. The description of this ‚Äúghost‚Äù resembles the ‚ÄúGreen Man‚Äù of pagan Celtic deity,  tradition possibly repeated by the first Scottish settlers who pioneered here circa 1803.  It was said that, should one venture down the lane one would see the ghostly face in the tree and, if it smiled one could continue unharmed, but, if it frowned, something terribly lay ahead.

	Ten years of conflicting research of these stories came to a partial realistic end when, some years ago, I met an elderly gentleman who, as a young child, had spent time in the old mansion and  had seen ‚Äúthe goings on‚Äù.  During the Prohibition years, he said, the mansion was a major meeting and transfer site for smuggling Canadian liquor across Lake Erie into the U.S.  

	Another part of this ‚Äúghost story‚Äù survives today on the internet is the ‚ÄúLake Erie Triangle‚Äù, modeled after the famed ‚ÄúBermuda Triangle‚Äù, which covers roughly Erie, PA to Cleveland, OH up to the north shore of lake Erie, ranging from Port Stanley to Long Point, depending on whom you talk to.  The area of lake Erie just off Erie, PA itself is sometimes referred to as ‚ÄúThe Graveyard of Lake Erie‚Äù because of the many shipwrecks in that area over the years. Factually there has been periods of mysterious disappearances of small boats and ships over the years, but after talking some time ago to members of the Eire County Historical Society, they point out that many of the ‚Äústrange disappearances‚Äù happened during Prohibition years  and that Erie, PA was a major port for incoming Canadian bootleg liquor.   The gentleman who told me the original story backed that point up.  According to him, violence was not uncommon on water or land, either side of the lake.

	So it came to be the bootleggers and smugglers of the time either knew or learned of this old ghost story and adapted it to help scare off the curious.  But the original story itself wasn‚Äôt always enough, it had to be supplemented by something more sinister - thus, The Face in the Tree.  This was, of course, the constant look-out who was hidden in the trees at the old ‚Äútraffic circle‚Äù in lane.  When I asked if the lookout was to watch for the authorities, the old gentleman scoffed at me and said bootleggers had those folks well paid off, ‚ÄúAnd besides‚Äù he snorted, ‚ÄúWe had bigger guns than them.  It was the other gangs who were the real danger.‚Äù   

	So I asked the old man ‚ÄúWhat was the something terrible that awaited down the lane if the face frowned instead of smiled at you?‚Äù  ‚ÄúWell‚Äù, he said, ‚Äúlet me put it this way; Lake Erie is a big place to try to find a person‚Äù.

	A good historian should be able to document and prove their thesis, however for obvious reasons, this is one I will never be able to do so.  The reader is to make up their own mind.   What is most interesting is how an original legend and bit of local folklore changed and expanded over time, either by happenstance or determined effort,  because it served a practical need.    Two distinct  events linked only by physical location yet bound inseparably by all those who still tell the story.  My whole main issue is this then: How many other stories, legend, myths and tales are there told today that may have gone through some similar metamorphosis in the past?   For any historical investigator who uses old folklore as a research tool, keeping this thought in mind may prove useful.

&amp;#x200B;

	I will close with two footnotes to ponder.   First, consider that the entire north shore of lake Eire was a major entry port for fleeing refugee slaves during the time of the Underground Railroad.  Sometimes when I talk to the  decedents of  mixed race families in our area I  encounter stories about the  difficult  issues these  relationships caused at the time, tales that are  not at all dissimilar from our original legend.   If we think of the preponderance of black settlers in this area and time frame, is there be another part of history waiting  to be discovered?   Secondly,  I noticed when researching this legend, a  genuine nervousness upon the part of some local  people in telling this story, while  others simply ‚Äúknew nothing‚Äù and walked away.   According to some people I know and knew in law enforcement, smuggling across lake Erie is still an issue today.  Canadian marijuana down, American handguns back up, but like Prohibition,  how does one factually document  stories of the current  black market?   However my point is, could present day conditions be both keeping the old  legend alive and even evolving somehow?  Perhaps in a hundred years, another story teller will answer that question."
4200,Exactly. We also fixed Lake Erie. When I was growing up all the textbooks said it was a dead lake. Then measures were taken and no more pollution and the lake is great. This is one of the Great Lakes in Northern mid America. Could have happened to all of them. We also banned DDT and saved apex birds.
4201,"Don't they advise you to only eat fish out of lake Erie once a week because of the PCB and Mercury concentration in the lake? Either way, you're right, there is better seafood than whatever mall buffet. But Boston has better seafood in their buffets even, which I think was more the point of their statement. And if you don't live near the lakes, it's hard to get the fresh fish from them."

4205,"Many places to paddle board, not just on Lake Erie. Lake Erie is amazing for paddle boarding on the days it is relatively flat, but sometimes the lake is angry. There are a number of other lakes dotting the area to SUP on those days."
4206,"I don't know the numbers now, but the DEC reported we had up to 50 eagles nesting along the Niagara River a few years ago. That is a major improvement over the bald eagle getting expatriated from this area and nearly going extinct as a species. The Niagara river and Lake Erie/Ontario region used to actually be a major home habitat for the bald eagle, prior to the 20th century. But then all the air pollution from heavy industry, loss of habitat and the use of pesticides like DDT did a lot of damage to their numbers here. The return of the bald eagle and other birds of prey (like red tail hawks and peregrine falcons) is an absolute major success story for the environment of Western New York."
4207,"Yeah, lakes and wetlands were pretty much just seen as dumps back then.  My wife grew up on a lake and said in the winter they'd have demolition derbies on the lake and just leave the wrecked up cars to sink in the spring, same with ice fishing shacks.  And that's not counting industrial pollution.

When zebra mussels came into the Great Lakes everyone thought they'd be horrible, and they were, but they also cleaned Lake Erie.  There were so many and they were such efficient filter feeders they ate more pollution than most human clean ups could only hope to do."

We brushed our teeth with a common plate we dipped our brushes in that had baking soda on it. We had a summer camp on lake Erie and swam in the most polluted water of the great lakes and slept in unheated shacks.I nearly died from a high fever once. No doctor. We had to wade knee deep  in clay muck just to get to the water then clear leeches off our legs. A giant coal burning power plant on lake Erie  was just across the road which made a sulphur smell and had a deadly water intake undertow just off our beach.One year we had to hide in a brick bathroom while a quite visible tornado was  threatening our lives.The last year I was there they were tearing down the St. Anthony Villa in Toledo and we had to stay at camp til nearly Christmas, freezing.

4212,"&gt;The Morris County Board of Freeholders and Assemblyman Anthony Bucco have authorized an expanded street sweeping and storm drain inspection and cleaning project on county roads around Lake Hopatcong. This is part of a coordinated effort with towns to improve Lake Hopatcong‚Äôs health. Lake Hopatcong has been closed to swimming for more than a month because of a series of algae blooms. Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey Sierra Club, released the following statement:

&gt;‚ÄúThis is just a PR stunt to make it look like they‚Äôre doing something when they‚Äôve been doing nothing. More street sweeping and storm drain inspects are too little too late. They should have been doing them all along. After all these years Assemblyman Bucco has been involved in Lake Hopatcong he has not done anything real to protect the lake. Now he‚Äôs issuing press releases about cleaning up streets. He should be pushing for a stormwater management plan for the lake, to bring back Septic Management Districts and expand stream buffers. We need more funding for restoration projects for wetlands and natural systems, and to retrofit stormwater systems in existing developments. We must also fix our aging infrastructure and reduce nutrients from failed septics, leaky sewers and combined sewer overflows.

&gt;‚ÄúLake Hopatcong has been closed to swimming for more than a month because of toxic algae. The algae can cause severe skin rashes and other illnesses. Recent tests showed the algae count increasing in many areas of Lake Hopatcong. We could reach a point where the lake itself collapses. Bucco‚Äôs issuing press releases about sweeping streets because he wants to sweep these problems under a rug. Lake Hopatcong‚Äôs crisis is a direct result of the state‚Äôs failure to properly protect our waterways. They have no watershed management programs. They have not addressed stormwater management and failed septics. They‚Äôve done nothing with nutrient loads and Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) to limit pollutants. They have not controlled overdevelopment.

&gt;‚ÄúAssemblyman Bucco bears some of the responsibility for Lake Hopatcong‚Äôs problems. He voted against the Highlands Act, and opposed Stormwater Management Utilities and C1 categorization of streams. He supported Christie-era rollbacks that got rid of the Septic Management Districts and weakened stormwater protections, rollbacks that still haven‚Äôt been reversed. He opposed dock fees that would provide money to help clean up lakes. Now he wants to clean up streets and storm drains. That‚Äôs not closing the barn door after the horse has escaped. The horse is 50 miles down the road. He attacks every program to help the environment, and then when something goes wrong and the public is an uproar, he pretends to do something. Bucco‚Äôs anti-government, anti-environment, anti-regulatory policies have helped create the pollution problems in Lake Hopatcong. A little cleanup now doesn‚Äôt accomplish anything.‚Äù"

(Any Steven Wright fans out there?)

Then I got a metal screen strainer at a dollar store that's a half-dome that drops into your drain and it catches the hair for easily removal. Usually have the clear it 2-3 times per shower to keep it from backing up, but it's better than the alternative and better for the environment."

&gt;Climate change is likely to increase the frequency, intensity and duration of cyanobacterial blooms in many eutrophic lakes, reservoirs and estuaries197,198. Bloom-forming cyanobacteria produce a variety of neurotoxins, hepatotoxins and dermatoxins, which can be fatal to birds and mammals (including waterfowl, cattle and dogs) and threaten the use of waters for recreation, drinking water production, agricultural irrigation and fisheries198. Toxic cyanobacteria have caused major water quality problems, for example in Lake Taihu (China), Lake Erie (USA), Lake Okeechobee (USA), Lake Victoria (Africa) and the Baltic Sea198,199,200.

&gt;Climate change favours cyanobacterial blooms both directly and indirectly198. Many bloom-forming cyanobacteria can grow at relatively high temperatures201. Increased thermal stratification of lakes and reservoirs enables buoyant cyanobacteria to float upwards and form dense surface blooms, which gives them better access to light and hence a selective advantage over nonbuoyant phytoplankton organisms202,203. Protracted droughts during summer increase water residence times in reservoirs, rivers and estuaries, and these stagnant warm waters can provide ideal conditions for cyanobacterial bloom development204.

&gt;The capacity of the harmful cyanobacterial genus Microcystis to adapt to elevated CO2 levels was demonstrated in both laboratory and field experiments205. Microcystis spp. take up CO2 and HCO3‚àí and accumulate inorganic carbon in carboxysomes, and strain competitiveness was found to depend on the concentration of inorganic carbon. As a result, climate change and increased CO2 levels are expected to affect the strain composition of cyanobacterial blooms205."

4250,"Yes, I'm native to Ohio, and did a large amount of research on Cleveland along with New York City's districts, Berlin and Singapore for an urban greenspace/beauty report. 

To the railways, it's a cost issue. The tracks in Cleveland are all subterranean or at least below the streets, but they're also locked in large part by Lake Erie existing, meaning you can't go too much lower. Coupled with what is probably a severe lack of funding even still (especially for something on the scale of a public transit system), it might just not be feasible. Cleveland uses a bike rental system and has been renovating their RTA system to try and compensate for this, but hey 90, 77, 71, and 480 all cross through the city, which really happens any progress RTA could make due to ease of access and encourages people to not move back due to how busy Cleveland feels with 3 freeways crossing right through downtown Cleveland. 

Housing in general in NE Ohio is a tad bit of a mess. Gentrification is 100% expected when property values are increasing, and honestly with how many improvements are going on in Cleveland, this is to be expected. The best answer for Cleveland would be to functionally freeze rates for current residents on their taxes for a number of years so the property value increases don't drive them out immediately."

4258,It may seem silly but scientists held a 'funeral' for Lake Erie here in Ohio once and it got enough attention that legislation was finally passed to curb pollution.  Now you can eat the fish from the lake and its ecosystem is really starting to thrive.
4259,"Very nice fish.  Fun fact time, there were once blue walleye that inhabited the Great Lakes that were an entirely separate species from the usual walleye we all know and love.  They were way over fished commercially in the middle 20th century, declared endangered in 1967, and went extinct in 1983.  Occasionally there are reports of them being caught but were later proven to be a blue color morph of the walleye.  The blue colored ones are typically found in Lake Ontario, Lake Erie, and the Ohio River."
4260,All very valid concerns! We are headed up to Lake Erie where lately there has been big issues with dogs getting sick from the blue green algae in the lake. We may be avoiding those waters. Thank you for the input!
4261,"Yes; I speak out about how gross generalizations and stereotypes are hurtful on a regular basis and have done so since the 70s. In this case the difference in skin from group to group has been somewhat documented outside of my own experience. I've dated diversely. The women I dated noted differences too. When you are in your teens and early 20s and with someone physically different from you talk about these things. 

I am going to assume you know what Magic Shave is. My friends used it. Their dads used it. So one morning I wake at my friends house and ask if I can use use to shave off my cheesy 17 year old kid mustache and some random facial hair. Well there should be a warning label on that shit that says 'not for white people'. Why? Because the shit burns your face. It opened up a pimple or two and left my face red and hurt like fuck. Mean while lots of my friends used it with no problem. 

My friends and I used to swim a lot. In lake erie, at a camp ground, and 2 public pools in walking distance to us. We'd have chicken fights. That is where someone is on your shoulders and you work to keep them up while they work to knock the other person down. Close physical contact with your friends pretty much all summer long. In cleveland the stereotype that black people dont swim never held water.

So I said what I said about skin differences based on intimate experiences. Further, I'm gonna be 50 next month. I'm still friends with some of the people from my pre-teens and teens. While not 100% the general trend is that my black friends have aged better than many of my white friends. 

But I also know that my personal experiences do not count as evidence; thus I require input from others to have justified beliefs. You may have read hitch hikers guide. Do you recall the man who rules the universe? I am as noncommittal to reality as that guy. What I see suggests truths -vs- makes truths.

* Rent a kayak and explore the Buffalo River and the megalithic Silo City"
4264,"On *capitalism*?  I don't think so.  On powerful cabals, sure.  Remember the Aral sea?  You might not, but *soviet* (that is to say, a communist economy) irrigation projects diverted its rivers back in the 1960s.  It used to cover almost 3x as much area as Lake Erie.  By the 1990s it was less than 1/4.

China's *four pests campaign* in the late 50s/early 60s was Mao's project to get rid of sparrows, mosquitos, rats, and flies.  Up to 45,000,000 people died of starvation after crops were ruined by this ecological, communist disaster.  

Powerful people doing stupid things out of ignorance and greed causes problems like this.  *Capitalism* doesn't, certainly not exclusively like you are utterly absurdly claiming.

edit:

Yes, someone is blaming ""virtually all social and environmental atrocities"" on *capitalism*

&gt;This disaster, like virtually all social and environmental atrocities, are specifically attributable to capitalism

Yes, there is a difference between perfect, theoretical, Marxist ""communism"" and the flawed transitional implementation of communism that humanity has actually experienced.  The term is useful as an alternative to capitalism, which is itself clearly being demonized by the above commenter.  There is nothing inherent about the conflict between the term's theoretical ideal and its practical implementation that makes it less of a foil against capitalism, when it is capitalism being erroneously called out for causing virtually all social and environmental atrocities.  [Not capitalism] is the point here."
4265,"Question. How does pre-release foil plastic end up in the ocean? It's opened in the store (the vast majority of the time) and stores collect the garbage and that gets set to a landfill. They only way it gets into the ocean in that scenario is if someone is trucking ships to the ocean and dumping it, and then perhaps that's the issue we need to address.

&gt; but your last paragraph is pure speculation.

It's not though. Anything biodegradable is instantly out, because booster packs are kept for decades and need to remain sealed. Anything purely paper based is out, because paper wouldn't protect the cards (e.g. from humidity), never mind that the package itself would be ruined. Anything derived from petroleum would just be a shift from one type of pollutant to another. Any organic non-biodegradable plastic replacement would have the exact same issue re:the ocean plus additional ones from people confusing it with biodegradable. Any metal based solution would have at minimum the same issue re:disposal and would likely add additional ones depending on the metal used.

At the end of the day you can't have something that doesn't break down but also does break down. It's an oxymoron. On the supply side there doesn't exist materials that meets the requirements without having bigger impacts. This has been discussed many times before and many material scientists have weighed in.

&gt; If current trends don't change, in 2 or 3 decades the world's oceans 

Luckily trends did change in the last decade or so. The US stopped recycling plastic, which was performed horrendously. The US didn't process it domestically, it shipped all the plastic back to china and was sorted in China (along with other similar countries such as Indonesia). Some of that was from accidents with boats, shipping crates falling off etc and some of it was foreign countries that have poor enforcement of environmental standards not catching companies that decided to dispose of waste plastic by dumping it in seas and the ocean. 

[China is responsible for 30% of ocean plastic](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/world-s-oceans-clogged-by-millions-of-tons-of-plastic-trash/) and the next offenders are Indonesia, the Phillipines, Vietnam, Sri Lanka and Thailand.

These countries have recently raised the standard of living enough that it's no longer profitable to attempt to hire people to sort through garbage and so we've stopped shipping garbage to them and have disposed of it in environmentally regulated domestic landfills which has helped reduce a lot of that waste. Now we just have to figure out a way to get environmental regulations enforced internationally so every country can make the change that we already made. 

Planet Money has a good [two part series](https://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnByLm9yZy9yc3MvcG9kY2FzdC5waHA_aWQ9NTEwMjg5&amp;episode=NmI1NTM5ZDQtMDliMy00Mzg4LTg4NDMtM2M4ZjExZGVjYzkz) if you're interested in the history of landfill and recycling."
4266,"Actually the cardboard would be even worse if it ended up in a landfill. If plastic ends up in a landfill in a developed country (which magic is biased towards since it's so expensive) then it just sits there. It doesn't really decompose and anything that leeches out is caught and handled correctly (that's the point of the environmental regulations and why local dumps aren't a thing anymore).

Paper on the other hand does partially decompose. Normally that'd be fine as it's CO2 neutral, but in a landfill there isn't enough oxygen to break it down to CO2. Instead it breaks down into methane, and methane is far worse in terms of GHG effects.

&gt; that they would even live in an area that can accept that recycling.

Or that the area even recycles it. Plastic comes in all different types and is often contaminated with food or something else (like glue). It requires sorting it by hand and paying workers even minimum wage to do that would be insanely expensive (not to mention dangerous as it could contain something toxic of biologically unsafe).

What most nations used to do for recycling was fill those shipping containers back up with plastic and ship them back to the countries everything was imported from (e.g. China). There labour was cheaper and safety regulations were lower and it'd get sorted there. Recently these countries have started to actually respect their citizens slightly so they've stopped accepting plastic.

Most recycling programs continue to take plastic in the hopes that someday we'll figure out a way to recycle it and then we won't have to reteach everyone to recycle, but chances are very good that the plastic is just ending up in the landfill.

&gt;Climate change is likely to increase the frequency, intensity and duration of cyanobacterial blooms in many eutrophic lakes, reservoirs and estuaries197,198. Bloom-forming cyanobacteria produce a variety of neurotoxins, hepatotoxins and dermatoxins, which can be fatal to birds and mammals (including waterfowl, cattle and dogs) and threaten the use of waters for recreation, drinking water production, agricultural irrigation and fisheries198. Toxic cyanobacteria have caused major water quality problems, for example in Lake Taihu (China), Lake Erie (USA), Lake Okeechobee (USA), Lake Victoria (Africa) and the Baltic Sea198,199,200.

&gt;Climate change favours cyanobacterial blooms both directly and indirectly198. Many bloom-forming cyanobacteria can grow at relatively high temperatures201. Increased thermal stratification of lakes and reservoirs enables buoyant cyanobacteria to float upwards and form dense surface blooms, which gives them better access to light and hence a selective advantage over nonbuoyant phytoplankton organisms202,203. Protracted droughts during summer increase water residence times in reservoirs, rivers and estuaries, and these stagnant warm waters can provide ideal conditions for cyanobacterial bloom development204.

&gt;The capacity of the harmful cyanobacterial genus Microcystis to adapt to elevated CO2 levels was demonstrated in both laboratory and field experiments205. Microcystis spp. take up CO2 and HCO3‚àí and accumulate inorganic carbon in carboxysomes, and strain competitiveness was found to depend on the concentration of inorganic carbon. As a result, climate change and increased CO2 levels are expected to affect the strain composition of cyanobacterial blooms205."

After a national effort to clean up the Great Lakes, and specifially the Superfund sites that dumped into Erie, it recovered. It wasn't a miracle. It was a lot of money and effort to reclaim a more natural environment.

You'd be amazed at how many state regulators just send letters back and forth and do nothing (see Michigan) because they are reluctant to enforce against political entities (""it's up to their voters to fix it"" is a common mantra).    Another reason is the algae blooms we get in the Northwest part of the state and along Lake Erie.    We have a few old industrial towns that have issues, mostly in the Cleveland/Akron/Canton/Youngstown area because there was so much manufacturing there in the past.  The biggest issue in central Ohio is occasional fertilizer and herbicide residue after heavy rains but the water is generally not that bad. Columbus sends reports a couple of times per year to all residents telling them what's in the water.  Cleveland's water actually isn't that bad, surprisingly, it's the smaller towns that can't keep up maintenance.  Akron is also not too bad since their water comes from Lake Rockwell, which has development limitations around it."

Next, the average industrial humidifier can produce 2.5 L of water per Kwh @ 80 F, and 60% Rel. Humidity. Flint, as of right now, is ~50 f and ~40% humidity, it would probably be about ~50% as efficient, but lets assume that Flint is optimal for solar panels and is nice and tropical.

This means for every 1 kg of water extracted, 18 grams of carbon are ""released"" by the solar panels (technically those emissions come from the resource gathering/production, etc.,  Hence the term life-cycle emissions).

The average american truck releases 160 g CO2/ton-mile hauled. It reduces down to 160 mg of carbon per kg(or liter)-mile of water hauled.

This means that a diesel truck can haul 1 kg of water 18/.16=110 miles and still have less emissions than an idealized solar powered dehumidifier in flint. That's enough range to haul water from lake Erie in Toledo, Ohio to Flint with less of an environmental impact than the solar option, even with all of the leeway I gave the water creation system.

TLDR:  Not even considering the financials, it would be worse for the environment than hauling water from out of state by truck."
4324,"So glad you appreciate my work, many thanks matey!

You have a solid camera and lens combination. I just briefly looked up your location and it is quite light polluted, which perhaps is why you are having trouble seeing and photographing the Milky Way. BUT, there is hope! It looks like there are some slightly darker skies further East of Monteville. Furthermore, Lake Erie looks promising if you want to short due North. This can be useful for targets facing North as well as star trails.

This time of year, the Milky Way is setting due Southwest on the horizon. The problem with that is you will be shooting facing Cleveland, so the light pollution on the horizon is washing out the Milky Way setting in that approximate location. However, and I am not quite sure how you can do this, but if you take a ferry or something to get across lake Erie such that you can shoot with it in your foreground facing due SE/S/SW, you will be able to grab the Milky Way far more effectively. This is because rather than light pollution in your direction of shooting, you will have a nice dark, unpopulated area for the stars to shine. The lake would also make for some awesome reflections compositionally.

Photopills is a great app, but it can be a little confusing at first. [Here](https://www.photopills.com/videos/how-find-and-plan-milky-way) is a comprehensive, but great video on how to use app to find the Milky Way. Be sure to use the NPF rule to calculate your shutter speed! 

Also keep note of the moon phase. This coming weekend the moon will be illuminated to the point where the Milky Way will be washed out. You are better off waiting until next weekend when the phase is more ideal. I hope this helps!"

4346,"I don't mind the occasional one, or two... The problem is their population is has exploded over recent years. In places where I used to see one or two, I now watch flocks of a hundred or so land in a bay while I've been fishing, all eating to their hearts content for hours before flying off to another area of the bay and repeating the process. They're consuming huge numbers of fish in areas that aren't used this type or number of predators.

In addition to that, their droppings  change the pH (of water and soil) causing everything to die which leads to  erosion. This in some areas has completely destroyed islands.  On Lake Erie for example, a cormorant colony of 20,000 has wiped out an estimated 40 percent of the tree canopy on Middle Island - that's a 46 acre island! 

Look I love wildlife - I just find their numbers are getting out of control and there's no real good solution to manage their numbers which is really concerning to me."

4354,"I‚Äôm on the east coast of Florida in Indian River County, the red tide on the west coast made it to me last fall, basically around and up the coast from the Gulf. I‚Äôve been very involved in several organizations addressing water issues in my area. Working with local politicians, organizing, and educating. So I‚Äôm happy to rant a little bit about them. 

Algae Blooms are happening all over the world at a rate hitherto unseen. Rising temperatures and climate change are exacerbating them and we as modern peoples are woefully unprepared for their impacts. 

Potable water sources all over are imperiled and strained by them. An example is [in Lake Erie and water taken from there. ](https://www.wxyz.com/news/giant-algae-bloom-returns-to-lake-erie-threatens-drinking-water). Most water treatment plants do not currently treat water for certain bacteria caused by the blooms. Cyanobacteria is an example of this. Getting it out of drinking water requires specialized treatment which many plants do not use as they‚Äôve never needed it before. This is expanded on in a very scary but interesting documentary called [The Toxic Puzzle.](https://www.toxicpuzzle.com/)

One of the biggest causes of the blooms is nutrient pollution (especially nitrogen and prosperous) and the best way to stop them is to stop nutrient pollution. Easier said then done though. Pretty much just our living our 21st century lives causes nutrient pollution. In Florida our population grows by about 900 people per day. We‚Äôre reaching the tipping point in many of our waterways. (As an aside, add in the archaic Florida water permitting laws and republican crony stacked water management districts and we have huge problems.) 

Money is the biggest thing stopping us from addressing real issues. Florida has over 2 million septic tanks. Any built before 1983 can be within 6 inches of the water table. (They added stricter regulations in 83, but older systems were grandfathered in and many pre-1983 septics are still in use today. [source from Indian River County. ](http://www.ircutilities.com/S2S/Presentation.pdf) 

So we are literally pooping into the water. How do we know? One way is Sucralose, lose, an artificial sweetener that cannot be broken down by the body or any treatment process for that matter. [source](http://www.fau.edu/newsdesk/articles/septic-system-study.php). It is an ingredient in diet sodas and the like. No way that could be in the water unless someone is dumping Diet Coke or the septic tanks are a leaking. 

That doesn‚Äôt even take into account into the bacterial like enteric bacteria which is found in waste. This caused the closure of beaches this year and last year here... And they only test three spots in the whole county... once a week. [Source. ](https://www.tcpalm.com/story/news/local/indian-river-lagoon/health/2019/08/16/bacteria-warning-indian-river-lagoon-sebastian-inlet-state-park/2028210001/)

Not really great for our tourism.  

At this point I try to stay away from the water personally because of the various health threats. A guy was killed here a few years ago from a flesh eating bacteria that he got from fishing. Others have also died. [source. ](https://www.tcpalm.com/story/news/local/indian-river-lagoon/health/2017/01/06/vibrio-vulnificus-indian-river-lagoon-bacteria/96166924/)

But I wish septics were the only problem. They are not. Other issues are fertilizers which are basically nitrogen. So add them to your non-native yard, it rains like it does in tropical Florida and it washes a bunch of nitrogen and phosphorus into our waterways, furthering the blooms and bad things in the water. Thankfully many cities and counties around here have banned application of fertilizer in the summer rainy season. But golf courses and Ag are exempted. And of course they are some of the biggest polluters. Add in that many local big box stores don‚Äôt care about local regulations and thus they still sell fertilizer even when it is illegal to apply it. [source. ](http://ircstormwater.com/fertilizer.htm)

Yet another contributor is stormwater runoff. As you probably know, Florida is pretty flat. It used to be a swamp for the most part. I live in what was once part of Mosquito County [(old map) ](https://www.floridamemory.com/blog/2018/12/21/a-county-called-mosquito/)because they had a lot of swampy standing water. In the middle of the 20th Century, as people were discovering how lovely the weather is in Florida, the state and local municipalities undertook one of the most ambitious engineering projects of the time, draining the swamps and straightening the rivers and making more land for people and farms. These canals still exist today and are maintained rigorously to avoid flooding. This basically flushes all the rain water to our lagoon and oceans. Untreated. So we also get septic pollution washing out from houses away from the waterways and also trash and plant waste (branches, grass clippings, etc.) in our waters. Some parking lots drain directly to the lagoon or ocean with no treatment. There are several stormwater parks in our area which treat the water in a natural way, as it passes through. Nature set itself up to clean out a certain amount of nitrogen from water as it goes by, trees use it (like our beautiful Mangroves) but there is too much now. [Source, but I said a lot here and it may not all be covered here. ](http://ircstormwater.com/)

This does not take into account the damage the freshwater does to the Indian River Lagoon, which is brackish (a mix of fresh and salt water) and messes with the ecosystems in the water. 

A further complication is ‚Äúsewage sludge.‚Äù The right wing PC word for this is Biosolids. Biosolids are the de-watered sewage by-product of wastewater (sewage) treatment plants. Despite the name, biosolids are predominantly water, typically containing only 20% solids. Because they are biologically active, nutrient-rich, and contain chemical compounds as well as toxic metals, disposal of biosolids onto open land is a major threat to our waters. Land application of these were banned in South Florida, so they moved up north and farmers were applying ‚Äúfree‚Äù fertilizer to their farms with sewage sludge from south Florida. My county has put a 6 month moratorium on these, but can not ban them completely due to state law. This led to a terrible bloom in Blue Cypress Lake last year. [source](https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-blue-cypress-lake-tragedy-20180720-story.html)

So back to money, just replacing all the septics in my county (all 30k of them) would cost the taxpayers an estimated $500 Million. I can not find a source for this but I heard the number from the IRC Director of Utilities at a meeting last week. One of the previous links provided the way they are doing it now, by fixing the biggest problems first, and could be done in a few hundred years at their current rate. 

Another way money is a big problem is that special interests buy a lot of influence. And the state legislature is doing pretty much nothing to stop it. [example. ](https://www.miamiherald.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/carl-hiaasen/article236586568.html) [another example. ](https://www.tampabay.com/news/environment/2019/10/24/new-florida-wildlife-corridor-expedition-aims-to-show-what-new-toll-roads-would-destroy/)

A few years ago there was a big victory for environmental groups, we had a citizen amendment called Florida Water and Land Conservation Initiative, Amendment 1 (2014). [Amendment info.](https://ballotpedia.org/Florida_Water_and_Land_Conservation_Initiative,_Amendment_1_(2014)). The legislature did not like this and did not abide with (at least) the spirit of the law. [source. ](https://news.wjct.org/post/court-backs-florida-lawmakers-conservation-fight) The money was supposed to buy and conserve land but has been used for other purposes. My favorite was to pay FDEP Tech Support salaries. Basically they took the money And used it for things that weren‚Äôt proper uses so they could get away without cutting other programs or raising taxes. 

All of this said, this may be more than you asked for but it really pisses me off how pretty little people care about their water. Water is everything, and giving crops or livestock polluted water can cause them to also be polluted. [source. ](https://www.onegreenplanet.org/environment/shocking-facts-on-how-factory-farms-cause-water-pollution/)

And I didn‚Äôt even get into things like [Glyphosate (Round Up)](https://usrtk.org/pesticides/glyphosate-health-concerns/) or when [there are sewer spills into the water. ](http://veronews.com/2018/07/26/city-aerating-bethel-creek-part-cleanup-effort-sewage-spill/)

Basically we‚Äôre a mess down here. Send help. But in all seriousness, I do have hope that this year the legislature will do *something*. It‚Äôs an election year after all but we need a lot of help and Gov. DeSantis‚Äô proposed legislation does not go far enough, imo. 

Sorry for any typos. Am in an app on my phone. Hope this helped. There‚Äôs so much more going on, but I fear we are on the brink of ecosystem crash here."
4355,"There are lots of reasons why there is fecal coliform in the river...Natural sources include birds, rodents, and wildlife. Non-natural 
causes of impairment include sanitary sewer collection system spills and leaks, storm drain discharges (including illegal recreational vehicle discharges and

There was a study of pathogens done in 2009 that showed 22% of samples from the river taken morth of Felton (near Brookdale) had fecal bacteria exceeding safe levels. In the river at Big Trees, that figure was 24% of samples exceeding safe levels, but at Sycamore Grove, just north of Santa Cruz, the figure was only 4%. The dirtiest part of the river is in downtown Santa Cruz, where 63% of samples taken at the Broadway bridge had unsafe levels of fecal coliform.

Elsewhere might be cleaner, but our huge lovely beach looks like a dump these days, and the water quality is always too low to advise swimming, but people ignore it.

4362,"The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald



The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down
Of the big lake they called Gitche Gumee
The lake, it is said, never gives up her dead
When the skies of November turn gloomy
With a load of iron ore twenty-six thousand tons more
Than the Edmund Fitzgerald weighed empty
That good ship and true was a bone to be chewed
When the gales of November came early



The ship was the pride of the American side
Coming back from some mill in Wisconsin
As the big freighters go, it was bigger than most
With a crew and good captain well seasoned
Concluding some terms with a couple of steel firms
When they left fully loaded for Cleveland
And later that night when the ship's bell rang
Could it be the north wind they'd been feelin'?



The wind in the wires made a tattle-tale sound
And a wave broke over the railing
And every man knew, as the captain did too,
T'was the witch of November come stealin'
The dawn came late and the breakfast had to wait
When the gales of November came slashin'
When afternoon came it was freezin' rain
In the face of a hurricane west wind



When suppertime came, the old cook came on deck sayin'
Fellas, it's too rough to feed ya
At seven p.m., a main hatchway caved in, he said
Fellas, it's been good to know ya
The captain wired in he had water comin' in
And the good ship and crew was in peril
And later that night when 'is lights went outta sight
Came the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald



Does any one know where the love of God goes
When the waves turn the minutes to hours?
The searchers all say they'd have made Whitefish Bay
If they'd put fifteen more miles behind 'er
They might have split up or they might have capsized
They may have broke deep and took water
And all that remains is the faces and the names
Of the wives and the sons and the daughters



Lake Huron rolls, Superior sings
In the rooms of her ice-water mansion
Old Michigan steams like a young man's dreams
The islands and bays are for sportsmen
And farther below Lake Ontario
Takes in what Lake Erie can send her
And the iron boats go as the mariners all know
With the gales of November remembered



In a musty old hall in Detroit they prayed,
In the maritime sailors' cathedral
The church bell chimed till it rang twenty-nine times
For each man on the Edmund Fitzgerald
The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down
Of the big lake they called Gitche Gumee
Superior, they said, never gives up her dead
When the gales of November come early"
4363,"One time it caused massive problems

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloonfest_'86

Balloonfest '86 was a 1986 event in which the United Way of Cleveland in Ohio set a world record by releasing almost one-and-a-half million balloons.[2] The event was intended to be a harmless fundraising publicity stunt, but the balloons drifted back over the city, Lake Erie, and landed in the surrounding area, and caused problems for traffic and a nearby airport. The event also interfered with a United States Coast Guard search for two boaters who were later found drowned.[1] In consequence, the organizers and the city faced lawsuits seeking millions of dollars in damages,[1] and cost overruns put the event at a net loss.[3]"

4365,"Outside of a safely designed highway I‚Äôm a big fan of trees and grass. I worked with a highway operations crew and I probably don‚Äôt need to tell you this, but maintenance funding is almost always the first to be cut or underfunded. Mowing excess amounts of land is counterproductive and an inefficient use of taxpayer money. 

A significant portion of sediment entering the local watersheds comes from degraded outfalls of highway storm drains. Thats a huge maintenance issue. Slope erosion sends sediment downstream, but IMO, not as much as degraded outfalls. 

I know my previous job worked tirelessly to identify available locations and plant trees as part of the federally mandated TMDL program. 

As a side note: the types of grass they plant are pretty crazy, too. Like, say they grade a slope but they know they won‚Äôt be back to work on it for a few months. They can spray seed that will pop in a few weeks to stabilize the sediment. Then they come back, finish the work, and plant a whole new fescue mix that will permanent establish sod cover."
4366,"I live near Lake Erie which has had problems with toxic algae blooms that have been getting progressively worse every summer. They have been unquestionably linked to fertilizer chemicals leeching into the ground from area farms and ending up in rivers that drain into the lake. These algae blooms have been wreaking more havoc on the lake's ecosystem than the pollution from Cleveland or Detroit, which is practically nonexistent now thanks to stringent water protection laws that have been in place since the 70s."

4374,"Parts of the Buffalo shoreline and city near the river/Lake Erie were flooded out under roughly 15-20 feet of water. Buffalo actually has a similar problem as New Orleans, where the city sits right at the lake/river level and if it wasn't for the break walls ( like NOLA's levees) , it would get flooded out by the seiches and lake tsunamis (yes the Great Lakes can have tsunamis). That Halloween night's winds really gave the edge of the city and the break walls a beating."
4375,"They don't allow the falls to freeze anymore because they need the river's current to generate electricity at the hydro plants farther down river. They stretch out this huge steel and concrete barrier called the ice boom between Buffalo and Fort Erie, a couple of miles above the falls. It breaks up all the big ice bergs that would come down river from Lake Erie. When the falls would freeze back in the day, it was actually all the big chunks of ice damming off the brink of the waterfalls and cause the water to back up. A massive amount of ice still does form at the bottom of the falls (about 50-70 feet, like a little glacier). The decks at the Cave of the Winds have to be torn out by hand before the winter sets in and rebuilt again every year, because otherwise they would get pulverized by the huge amount of ice and snow that builds up."
4376,"	Subchaser Sunbeam	Edit

A similar wreck, involving a wooden vessel, occurred in June 1923. The craft, previously a World War I submarine patrol boat called the Sunbeam, had been returned to its owner, a New Yorker, after the war ended. The owner sold the boat to a new owner, and the boat was taken west on the Erie Canal, to be docked at a port in Lake Erie. The crew made a navigation mistake and found themselves well into the Niagara River, though still several miles upstream from the falls. They retired for the night in a nearby hotel. During the night, the unmanned boat came loose from its moorings.

The current carried the craft to the vicinity of the scow, and it likewise became caught in the shoals. The owners sold the wreck to Red Hill for a nominal sum, but Hill decided that the salvage cost was too high, so the boat remained marooned and by the late 1930s had broken apart. Some of its metallic parts are still visible at times when a significant quantity of water is being diverted for hydropower production"

South bass island (put in Bay) doesn't have any great beaches as it's all rock.  Best bet is East harbor state park.  Very shallow and all sand and easy to access.  Also, cedar point beach is great and not many know it's open to public without park admission as long as you pay to park ( or come by boat).  Geneva on the lake state park is has a great beach and a lodge but is kind of limited in other activities compared to the islands region.  Also, don't listen to the lake haters.  Yes algae blooms are a problem and generate news but they don't start till August and are confined to the far Western regions (avoid Maumee Bay).  Bacterial problems are only a problem around Cleveland and Toledo after high rain events.  Stick to the above areas and you'll be fine.  Plus the other great lakes are super cold compared to Erie.

When going the pool in the summer meant risking paralysis from polio?  When chicken a la king, tuna aspic and the shrimp cocktail were the high points of cuisine?  Before the Clean Air and Clean Water acts, when the downtowns of major cities were regularly blanketed with killing smog, the major rivers and waterways of the midwest - including Lake Erie - were all basically dead zones and organic lead spewed from every tailpipe?

In 2014, it left 400,000 people without drinking water for three days after toxins infiltrated Toledo‚Äôs water system. Then-Gov. John Kasich declared a state of emergency and called in the National Guard to distribute bottled water in an incident that served notice that drinking water from Lake Erie was in peril.

Greater rainfall and more powerful storms are eroding some of the richest soils in the United States and, in doing so, washing bloom-inducing fertilizers from farm fields into Lake Erie. More frequent torrential downpours are also overpowering antiquated sewer systems at times, releasing a profusion of raw sewage into waterways, further polluting and degrading water quality....""

4408,"I read the NY Climate Change report, IIRC it says that they don't expect that water levels are going down, but rather that it is possible that they'll go up (as a result of climate change). 

That doesn't mean that Nestle can't impact the levels, or that they were even being accounted for in the projections. But from what can be seen, water levels are rising - not going down.

The water levels I saw on Lake Erie this year were intense. A beach that used to be about 20 meters from the shore of the water to where the line of the beach starts had been completely submerged by water. It wasn't from intense rain either or from the melting of ice because this lasted for months and wasn't near the time of winter. 

Lake Ontario is experiencing the same phenomena aswell though. The water levels are rising there and quite more alarmingly, to the point where it's actually flooding. It is so bad that there is erosion, just like that beach on Lake Erie. But the rate of erosion is again alarming and destroying property like peoples' houses.

[Here](https://buffalonews.com/2017/05/19/lake-ontario-outflows-boosted-as-lakeshore-continues-to-crumble/) is an article on the Lake Ontario erosion and [here](https://weather.com/news/weather/news/lake-ontario-before-and-after-images-erosion) are some dramatic pictures of it."
4409,"NW Great Lakes would be pretty good. I lived on Lake Huron and I think of all the algae and pollution I had to deal with. My job was environmental and water pollution clean up.  


North where Lake Michigan and Lake Huron connect  there is a huge underwater oil  pipeline that has been watched for years ( there were senate hearing on it a few years ago) and is ready to fail anytime. If a collapse happens and constant maintenance is not done- the amount of oil discharged will be catastrophic for the water system of both Great Lakes.

Where I'm from tiny patches of woods dot the countryside like unshaven pubic hair.  The only megafauna remaining is deer.  Endless, car smashing deer.  

Ohio is a great example of what happens to an environment without oversight.  At one time it was home to bears, wolves, coyote, and mountain lions.  No more.  

Lake Erie used to burn with pollution.  We put in an EPA and fixed it.  For a time it was a great lake for sportsmen. Now it's fished out with few Walleye left.  And Trump put a coal lobbyist in charge of the EPA.  I'm sure that will go well.

California isn't expensive because of government meddling, it's expensive because it is someplace people want to be.  It's a damn wonderful place full of opportunity and tolerance.

4425,"Yes that does happen for sure. The great black swamp area in general has a very high nutrient input. After all, it was the most productive agricultural fields in the country at one point because it was a massive wetland system. The tiles  are in various forms, new tile is corrugated PVC and historically it has been a casted clay which fractures causing leaks. Manure transport across state lines is regulated by USDA and the various applicable state agencies, often the transport is fairly local as the cost to move it long distances is too high to be feasible. 

Another major issue is the lack of riparian buffer on the channelized streams and ditches. A wide vegetated buffer combined with a stream or waterway that meanders provides much more opportunity for the nutrients to be recycled. That‚Äôs why we are seeing localized issues (see Grand Lake St. Marys) and large scale (Lake Erie). Fortunately studies are showing that the BMPs are more cost effective than the inverse."

Yes, the Greatest Generation told us we were on our own but the boomers fixed it.  All of it.  

NONE of that was insurmountable.  The only way you fail is socialism.  All your social problems will be fixed: global warming, for example, will be fixed when technology is developed to fix it, like peak oil was fixed when the problem became profitable enough to solve.  If no one can afford houses, their prices will fall.  The only way you fail is socialism."

&gt;TOLEDO, OH (WTOL) -
&gt;A Toledo group is calling for a Lake Erie Bill of Rights. 

&gt;On Monday, the group Toledoans for Safe Water will submit petitions with just over 100-thousand signatures to the Lucas County Board of Elections  to place an issue before voters on the November ballot.

&gt;The group says if it is passed the initiative would enshrine in the Toledo City Charter that the Lake Erie watershed and ecosystem have legal rights, including the right to exist and flourish and would allow polluters of the lake to be held accountable in court.

&gt;""We as Toledoans were frustrated with the lack of progress with the state government. We wanted to take advantage of our home rule in the constitution to self governance. This is important to the citizens of Toledo and this is how Toledoans will fight back,"" said Sean Nestor, with the group.

4443,"Yes, it would be pretty easy for a boat like that to get swamped by a moderately high breaking wave, and even partially filling with water is going to profoundly impact the maneuverability and handling of the boat. It creates a cascading situation - first you get hit by one wave that maybe doesn‚Äôt seem so bad because there‚Äôs only an inch or two of water in the boat, but then when the next wave hits you‚Äôre already an inch or two lower so even more water comes in in the next one. Even if you never get hit by a second wave, the weight and inertia of the water inside makes the boat very unstable and makes it much harder to gain speed, steer, go straight, and stop. 

I really appreciate that you‚Äôre asking for advice instead of just taking your chances. The main factors in most paddling deaths are inexperience and inappropriate preparation for conditions. If you want to get out on the ocean, get the right kind of boat, and don‚Äôt forget to always wear your PFD. 

Any boat that can take a skirt can be reasonably safe for light ocean use, although shorter boats are going to have handling issues. A spray skirt will keep water out even if a large wave crashes over you, although you‚Äôd still be in danger if you capsized and didn‚Äôt know how to roll upright. I take my whitewater boats out on the ocean or just Lake Erie in big waves from time to time, but I got a touring boat for serious open water. They‚Äôre a lot more than $149 but used ones can be fairly affordable, often under $500 if you‚Äôre willing to deal with an older unit. 

Oh, for a beginner a sit-on-top is also a great option to get on the ocean without a lot of hassle, but only for fair weather conditions. "

Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald
Song by Gordon Lightfoot


The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down
Of the big lake they called 'gitche gumee'
The lake, it is said, never gives up her dead
When the skies of November turn gloomy
With a load of iron ore twenty-six thousand tons more
Than the Edmund Fitzgerald weighed empty
That good ship and crew was a bone to be chewed
When the gales of November came early
The ship was the pride of the American side
Coming back from some mill in Wisconsin
As the big freighters go, it was bigger than most
With a crew and good captain well seasoned
Concluding some terms with a couple of steel firms
When they left fully loaded for Cleveland
And later that night when the ship's bell rang
Could it be the north wind they'd been feelin'?
The wind in the wires made a tattle-tale sound
And a wave broke over the railing
And every man knew, as the captain did too,
T'was the witch of November come stealin'
The dawn came late and the breakfast had to wait
When the gales of November came slashin'
When afternoon came it was freezin' rain
In the face of a hurricane west wind
When suppertime came, the old cook came on deck sayin'
Fellas, it's too rough to feed ya
At seven pm a main hatchway caved in, he said
Fellas, it's been good t'know ya
The captain wired in he had water comin' in
And the good ship and crew was in peril
And later that night when his lights went outta sight
Came the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald
Does any one know where the love of God goes
When the waves turn the minutes to hours?
The searches all say they'd have made Whitefish Bay
If they'd put fifteen more miles behind her
They might have split up or they might have capsized
They may have broke deep and took water
And all that remains is the faces and the names
Of the wives and the sons and the daughters
Lake Huron rolls, superior sings
In the rooms of her ice-water mansion
Old Michigan steams like a young man's dreams
The islands and bays are for sportsmen
And farther below Lake Ontario
Takes in what Lake Erie can send her
And the iron boats go as the mariners all know
With the gales of November remembered
In a musty old hall in Detroit they prayed,
In the maritime sailors' cathedral
The church bell chimed till it rang twenty-nine times
For each man on the Edmund Fitzgerald
The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down
Of the big lake they call 'gitche gumee'
Superior, they said, never gives up her dead
When the gales of November come early

result of industrial discharges, dredging and dredge material disposal. The sources of

4461,"&gt;\&gt;&gt; Trump isn‚Äôt a fascist

then why does he say a whole lot of things that are fascist, why does he emulate and cozy up to dictators.  Even if you support him, you should be able to answer that.

&gt;Saying that state power is another term for we want slavery is just wrong.

Do you know when states rights entered the common discussion?  When the south was trying to whitewash everything in the era of civil rights.  You know what the civil war was about before that?  Slavery.  You know how we know this?  Because the documents from the Confederate States all reference slavery as the reason they were leaving the Union.  States rights is absolutely code word for discrimination.  Yeah it's not about slavery anymore, but it's about not recognizing civil rights for minorities, but better protect the fuck out of the majority religion that wants to be bigots.

&gt;  Fascism as a government system involves control of everything, including businesses, press, and a government that controls most aspects of the country. 

Fuck man, you couldn't even bother to have skimmed wikipedia before trying to define fascism?

&gt; The best way to talk about government and lawmaking procedures and problems in this country is to have a non emotional discussion where participants don‚Äôt use sensationalized arguments in order to get a rise out of the other side. 

Yep, but those racist fucks elected someone who does just that because her emails.

You are right, Republican policies are about removing the governments involvement from economics, unless it's giveaways to the big business that's lobbying them.  History has repeatedly shown that business left to do business with no oversight is bad for society as a whole.  Read the Jungle, why do they want to cut the FDA.  Read about Lake Erie catching on fire or how coal poisons thousands of gallons of water and ruins the ecosystems, why do they want to cut the EPA (that was fucking started by a republican, who would have thought Nixon would be looked at as the good guy?  Conservatives used to care about something other than enriching the 1% at the cost of everyone else and making everyone afraid of people that aren't white."

Fun fact on the Cuyahoga River fire. The 1968 fire really wasn't that big a deal. The black and white photos you see of shooting flames and fireboats spraying water are all from the much larger and damaging 1952 river fire. The '68 fire got attention because Time Magazine put it on the cover. Which ended up being a great thing, because awareness of the fire drove a ton of important environment legislation that cleaned up both the river and Lake Erie."

The post balloon release coverage, acting like the 60% of balloons that wound up in Lake Erie having no effect on fish and wildlife shows the general mindset of Americans towards 5he environment back then. If you go back 100 years earlier, Americans had a mindset that the environment was something to be tamed by humans. When a flock of passenger pigeons flew overhead, everyone got out their shotguns and started blasting the flock overhead, or there would be train passing through the midwest where Americans would hunt buffalo from the comfort of the train wholesale slaughter buffaloes  out on the prairie and let their carcasses rot. We forced starvation on the Native Americans who relied on the buffaloes as a significant source of food to submit to living on Indian reservations."

4487,"It's not just happening down in Florida too. The Great Lakes have been having their own toxic algae bloom, with Lake Erie having the most damage. The Lake Erie algae bloom has been happening for mostly the same reasons, a massive amount of fertilizers from farming operations slowly leaking into the watershed and the natural ecosystems wiped out in favor of growing singular monocrops. Rick Scott just happens to banking off one of Florida's big cash crop industries (sugar instead of corn or wheat). All that sugar getting grown down there is just taking away the natural buffer that would help protect the watershed from this kind of stuff. One of the big similarities between the two algae blooms is that both areas that have been heavily affected both used to be these huge chunks of swamp/marsh wetland areas."
4488,I'm sure we can get people from all over to fund that.  It is a point of national shame that Canada's half of Lake Erie is deeper than our half.  Any true patriot would contribute to the dig.
4489,If it was in Lake Erie there's a 50/50 shot it was just a giant turd from the raw sewage that drains into the lake.
4490,"As a landscape and turf-grass management certificate student in Northwest Ohio, I can only hope this guy doesn‚Äôt have the same reckless abandon as the president of the US when it comes to environmental regulation. Our sewage is feeding toxic algae in Lake Erie. "
4491,"Festivals aside, I have been aware that my kids (now in their 30's) were far less careful than my generation with ""stuff"". I suppose because my parents grew up during the depression and had to take care of what they had because it wouldn't be replaced, they were very hard on me to do so as well. There were very few things considered truly disposable. My friends were much the same even if their folks weren't quite as strict as mine. We used things up. Buying even a cheap tent to leave behind somewhere would be unthinkable. We would pack it away for that future date when we or someone we knew might have a use for it - even just a kid ""camping"" in the back yard. But I failed to impress this value on to my kids when they were still at home somehow. They preferred to buy cheap new stuff over having free hand me downs. When they moved out, they griped about taking old furniture, for instance, where I had been thrilled to get anything that allowed me to spread my money further. I'm sure there are a few tents in the garage that were used once and forgotten and another tent bought for the next camping trip. Funny though, now that they are established, and raising families and have true money concerns, they are less wasteful.

I find it really strange that in this day of sooooo much concern for the environment, that this kind of carelessness is prevalent. My parents generation thought nothing of burning whatever crap they had to save on a trip to the dump, and had no idea that a lot of it might be toxic. But they reused jars and margarine containers. The 70's brought all kinds of pollution controls and changes - kids today gripe about smog but have no idea what cities were like in the 60's! We couldn't swim in Lake Erie back then because it was a cesspool or worse. Yet, there is just so much cheap, disposable crap out there. Appliances are only built to last about 4 or 5 years and then dumped. Ridiculous! They used to last 20-30! But people want the latest ""looks"" in their kitchens don't they? pfft. I just don't get it. I must be old."
4492,"Also! Some of the closure events you mention are due to harmful algal blooms. This is mainly caused by fertilizer runoff into Lake Erie from farming in the Maumee River basin, rather than from sewage input.

This is a huge problem, but there is lots of push back from farmers who like the status quo."
4493,"&gt;Why is this still a thing?

Because building enough capacity to hold virtually unlimited amounts of rainwater for the entire Lake Erie basin is a project that will [take about 25 years](https://www.neorsd.org/community/about-the-project-clean-lake-program/).

The overflow that occurred in August is supposedly the 3rd time it happened all year."
4494,"I‚Äôd just get a baby one and keep it in my pool. Once it starts getting too big for my pool, I‚Äôll just release it into Lake Erie and then get a new one."
4495,"Tesla model 3 is 35 grand. It's an incentive to push people to buy electric vehicles. If there are other incentives, or initiatives to help with our climate problems I'm all ears, but there's a pervasive attitude that because it costs money we should just do nothing at all and ignore the problem. Climate change is real, humanity to a large degree is responsible for it, we can't ignore it. What's worth more? The air we breath, the food we eat, or some ""tax"" money? We sacrifice our long term stability as a society for a short term gain in profits. Besides, it's never going to get better unless large corporations change. The idea that these problems are caused mostly by consumers is a myth. The plastic in the Pacific for example is largely made up of fishing nets, and pollution in lake Erie is caused by large companies dumping waste, plus large amounts of farm run off (also from the U.S). Companies make money, that's what they do and they do it at any cost. We have to give companies a reason to cut back on waste. If you have any way to do that besides Cap and Trade, Carbon Tax, or heavy regulations I'm for it, but no such ideas have been forwarded by the Ontario Government. The P.C party would prefer to stick their heads in the sand. "

4499,"I live by the Great Lakes and we've seen an increase in severe weather around the metro Detroit area that have included increase rainfall and sharper tempature shifts. Theirs also been concern over growing algil blooms coming from sewer runoffs in Lake Erie and Lake St Clare, a byproduct of the increased rainfall.

4501,"The reason the world stopped putting phosphates in detergents was due to the science they did in those lakes.

The reason why Lake Erie is as clean as it is now, is because of that. The algal blooms were horrific every year, because of all the nutrients flooding into the lake. It still gets bad from time to time, mostly from farm runoff these days, but it is nowhere near as bad as it used to be."
4502,"to be honest, we're still wondering if the hotter, and wetter weather patterns are going to do.  We've seen drought patterns up here, followed by a fall/winter/spring that was so wet that lake erie completely reversed it's losses, and ended up with a deeper lake than we had seen in ten years. 

our larger concern is going to be how to maintain the stock, and quality of the drinking water long term.  with longer hot periods, and hotter than normal temps in the south crops and people will start to migrate north. "
4503,Lake erie was near completely dead for over 50 years
4504,I thought we learned from this when a giant Algae bloom hit Lake Erie and fucked up Toledo‚Äôs drinking water for a bit. And that was only a couple years ago.

4506,"My boyfriend lives within a stones throw of Lake Erie. Huge bulk carriers go through the Cuyahoga River multiple times a week. HUGE boats. Fuck, I don't even want to get on the dinky ass water taxi that just goes a very short distance through the river. 

Let alone be on a 1000 foot boat with dead weight of 30000 TONS. Where NO ONE MIGHT FIND YOU."
4507,"Isn't this from runoff from farming ie chemicals that then get into the water and make these bacteria explode? I am originally from Ohio and we had a situation similar on lake Erie. Erie is still VERY bad but they have since cleaned it up and laws have been put into place to protect humans and wildlife from companies and farming pollution. It got so bad that a rive connecting to Erie caught fire, and people think Florida's crazy, Ohio is a $hithole beyond all $hitholes!! I know regulation is a bad word, but in some cases it isn't just something we want it is something needed and badly. I hate to see a place I have had love for as many do and moved to away from literally the worst state in the union (Ohio) to beautiful Florida turn into Ohio-South. "
4508,"I'm from Buffalo, our proximity to New York City means we likely didn't suffer a direct hit, but are bombarded by radiation from Lake Erie. It'd be a great place to dig up history about America's occupation of Canada pre-war. Our biggest post war city is probably The Dome, built inside the ruins of our hockey arena. Scavvers, raiders, and ghouls would be very common. Because of the divergence Buffalo would probably be much larger than the real life city, because it was a thriving city of industry pre divergence sitting comfortably on the rust belt. Not a lot of diverse wildlife, but we are placed near a very large hydro electric dam that powers most of the state, so it'd be hotbed for tyrants and major factions battling for the critical resource.

4511,"This is a serious issue. First and foremost we must maintain the electric dense that stops carp from entering Lake Erie. There have been some attempts to introduce the carp as an edible fish, which we could examine more. After that we should work with the central department of natural resources to contain, prevent and spot carp. "

Yes, you are unlikely to find dinosaur fossils around here, but ~400 million years ago Ohio was underwater below the equator and as a result there are a lot of corals and seashells in Lake Erie, just waiting to be found! Lake Erie is like a bathtub and rocks and fossils just wash up continuously. 
Hunt along the beaches, particularly ones with stones. I've found lots of corals and bivalves over the years. You just have to appreciate the small things. Many of the fossils are mineralized so they're iridescent and especially pretty.

4518,"Hold on a second... That's so crazy it just might work! Quick, everybody start dumping oil into lake Erie! The two pollutions will cancel each other out, giving us a clean lake!"
4519,"There are a few reasons for it that come to mind for me.

People do have a short memory about this sort of thing.  Which has always been the case.  There is also the factor of people saying ""it won't happen here"" or ""it won't happen again"".  

Those are just part of human nature though.  I don't think there is anything we can do to get rid of those factors.  

Honestly, I think one of the biggest problems with people's lack of preparedness is the ""culture of preparedness"".  I consider myself a prepper and even then a lot of what I see turns me off from it.

I keep my prepping fairly quiet, and I prep for very normal things.  Major storms, large scale power outages, etc etc.  My in laws had no idea I was a prepper until the summer of 2014 (a year after the wife and I got married) when Toledo (where they live) had a toxic algae bloom in Lake Erie and the water for the entire town was dangerous to even touch with your skin for several days and not safe to drink for over a week.

My wife of course knew I was a prepper and always thought I was a bit crazy about it.  She always thought if something happened you just run to the store and get what you need real fast.

We got a call at 8:45 am about the situation from her parents.  Her entire family (about 16 people) who lived in the city had run out to stores and bought what they could.  However it wasn't much.  

Many of her family members had gone to Ann Arbor, Cleveland and other ""nearby"" towns two and three hours away to get water and found shelves were empty.

The wife went to buy some water for them here in Columbus (about 3 hours from Toledo) and found that by the time she got to the store around 10am that they were sold out down here too.

The wife came home and had this look on her face like she hated that she had to admit that I was right about how fragile our modern infrastructure actually is.  

I loaded up the truck with 20 5 gallon bottles of water that I had in the basement  (Side note, carrying 800 pounds of water up stairs sucks) and we went trucking towards toledo.  

I called two of my buddies to ride up there and help me out with the water deliveries.  I told the wife it was because I wanted help lugging the water.  Really it was because I wanted help securing the water as I had a feeling people would be getting desperate.  We all three have our concealed carry permits.  But that day we all three open carried and made sure to bring a few extra magazines.  I also wore a vest under my shirt, which thankfully was not needed.

The truck was full when we left town, but with all that extra weight and interstate driving I had to get gas.  My two buddies got out of the truck while I did ""to stretch their legs"".  

While nobody got violent and tried to steal our water.  Four or five people did come up to us begging for the water.  Some offered to buy it most just begged for it.

After we finish dropping off the water at all of her family's various houses my father in law said something to the effect of ""I'm glad we called you and you were able to grab this water for us in Columbus"".

Then the wife told him that Columbus was sold out too and all this water was already sitting in our basement because I was a ""prepper"".

Their response was something to the affect of ""But he's a normal person."".  

Basically, they thought preppers were crazy people.  And I don't really blame people who think that.  Everytime you see or hear about preppers it always comes across as crazy.  People talking about Zombies, Aliens, Nuclear war, The complete collapse of our entire society resulting in a mad max movie, armed uprisings, WW3 etc etc.

They also talk about how you have to have your own private army and arsenal that could rival a small country and you need to be able to fight like you are a real life action hero.

Very rarely do you hear preppers talking about things like hurricanes, Earthquakes, tornadoes, blizzards, drought, water table contamination, layoffs, etc etc.

Even I, as a prepper get tired of people only talking about the crazy things (that yes, mostly could happen but aren't very likely) and ignoring the things that absolutely will happen.


TLDR;


When the city the In Laws live in had a water crisis and found out I was a prepper by me bringing them 20 5 gallon bottles of water they were surprised I was a prepper because ""I wasn't crazy"".  

Most people consider preppers to be crazy because more preppers talk about things like the complete collapse of society resulting in a mad max movie (which could happen but isn't very likely) instead of things like layoffs due to a bad economy or a hurricane (which absolutely will happen).

IMO many people don't prep because many preppers come off as crazy."
4520,"Yeah, I know they are but they have a lot of trouble controlling the farm runoff that originates to the south of them. There are so many little rivers and creeks that empty into Lake Erie it‚Äôs gonna take something state and region-wide to fix it. "
4521,It‚Äôs pretty good nowadays. The burning of the Cuyahoga was one of the big motivations the nation needed to create the EPA. The lake and rivers certainly aren‚Äôt pristine but I feel like the fish out of the lake don‚Äôt come with as bad a mercury advisory anymore. Lake Erie is on par with the ocean at the very least.
4522,"Agreed.

This doesn't change the facts that Pioneer knowingly and willingly employed a registered sex offender, utilized poorly-maintained and unsafe buses (which is the only reason the Lake Erie bus was needed in the first place), failed to provide adequate health care throughout the tour (which put at least one member in the hospital), reprimanded membership for doing precisely what DCI had instructed them to do in regards to reporting ethics violations, publicly condemned whistleblowers as ""snitches,"" and as of yesterday, publicly retaliated against a whistleblower...yet another ethics violation.

u/BachCheddar did a classy thing by setting the record straight on the Lake Erie bus, but if the Blenskis and their sychophants think that's going to magically vindicate them from all other wrongdoing, they're sadly mistaken."

4525,"It was a freakin' disaster. They thought it'd be fun to break the Guinness world record of the most bloons launched at the same time and they had like a hundred people work on tying balloons. A total of 1.5 million balloons were released. The consequences were insane.

* An airport had to fucking shut down half an hour later because of the insane amount of balloons that fell there

* Two fishermen were lost in the sea and the rescue team were looking for heads afloat in the water which was impossible because of the amount of balloons there. Their bodies were washed ashore at a few days later.

* The waterways of many places in Ohio were clogged thanks to balloons

* Thousands upon thousands of balloons landed in the canadian side of lake erie and they had to spend probably days up the mess.

Moral of the story: Balloons are bad. Pop all of them."

4527,"Warmer temperatures in the north can actually cause more snow, or to actually quote a meteorologist ""because warmer air holds more water vapor, which is the fuel for snow"" for example  in 2006 Lake Erie didn't freeze, which causes *more snow fall* in the surrounding area due to increased evaporetion. Furthermore you seem to be confused between weather and climate, one is an average the other is not and thus periodic aberrations are expected.. Actually more extreme weather has been predicted for quite a while now."

4532,"The Cleveland Balloon Disaster of 1986. 

At that time, the City of Cleveland attempted to set a Guinness World Record by releasing over one-and-a-half-million balloons into the sky from one location. 

The resulting cloud was so thick that it temporarily shaded out the sun over part of the city. Many of the balloons went straight into Lake Erie, which interfered with a very urgent Coast Guard search and rescue mission. The victims were found dead several days later. 

Most of the remaining balloons drifted up to Canada, where they promptly deflated and littered natural areas en masse. 

For weeks, the shoreline was covered in pieces of rubber. 

The Guinness Book of World Records refused to recognize the stunt due to its severe negative impact on the environment. Many of the participants seemed genuinely shocked that the balloons eventually fell back down to the ground. "

4535,"I'm sorry to hear that. I just read an article in search of the origin of the alga blooms.
 Lake Erie has been plagued with an alga bloom for years. The cause is all the fertilizer run off from the surrounding farms. "
4536,"[Ok, but lets look at a non-state government funded fact sheet.](https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/animals/a22725970/what-are-red-tides/)

Over time, as human activity has increased, the blooms of both red tide and blue/green cyanobacteria have gotten worse both in severity and in length when they move inshore.  In fact, the longest offshore bloom in recorded history of red tide was ongoing until it moved inshore this year.  

It's true that that blooms start offshore, but the discharges create a perfect storm for them to move inshore and do their dirty work.  And by in-shore, I mean under 10 miles from shore, because i've personally see the discharge color break 8 miles out in my own boat.   [New research has shown that K. brevis feeds off way more sources, fertilizers included, then we previously thought.](https://www.sailorsforthesea.org/programs/ocean-watch/nutrients-feed-red-tide)

Do you think the same thing about the blue-green cyanobacteria?  Because there is even more evidence, from Lake Erie to Lake Okeechobee, that pollution is the main factor in bloom severity.  Yes, its a natural bacteria, but it would never get to this level naturally without all the food we give it.

[Even fucking Ohio gets it and the governor, also a Republican, took emergency action to reduce the levels of run-off heading into Lake Erie because IT FEEDS THE ALGAE/BACTERIA BLOOMS.](https://www.cleveland.com/expo/news/erry-2018/07/49b4353a83940/lake-eries-2018-harmful-algal.html) . Phosphorus being the main culprit (guess where a shit on of Phosphorus comes from....Florida). 

Why is it so hard for our Republicans to understand what Ohio republicans have accepted as fact?

4540,"&gt;  just because the decisions are going to be made locally, doesn't mean that the decisions will be better 

You're right, it doesn't mean the decisions will *necessarily* be better, but the decisions will at least be able to respond to the local needs. With state control, the decisions will likely just follow what's needed in NYC because that's where the voter base is, and all decisions are forced to fall in line with that. But Manhattan is worlds apart from South Bronx, let alone a small town along Lake Erie. I'm not saying local control is a panacea, and I doubt Larry is saying that either, I just think it would tend to yield better results as a whole.

I don't know if you've worked at a company larger than a few dozen people, but hopefully this parallel will resonate with you. If you've worked at a medium sized company, you may have noticed that upper management or corporate occasionally imposes sweeping standards on everyone. Maybe it works well for a third of the groups in the company or even two thirds, but almost invariably, certain groups become less efficient because those standards don't quite work for them. The firm I work for allows for localized control over certain things and those things work really well, but there are some burdensome office wide standards that don't make any sense to us (obviously they make sense to SOMEone at corporate) and we in the satellite office have to fight and claw just to get them to allow us to things the way we think it should be done (sometimes we literally have to ""hide"" things from them so we can do what's best for us). And very often, when we are allowed to do things our way, things get better (for us). Do we make better decisions for ourselves than corporate? It certainly appears that we do. Do we make the *right* decisions? Certainly not all the time. Can we make better decisions for corporate than corporate themselves? Probably not.

The basic logic is that even if the smartest, rightiest, and bestest people work in Albany (or DC), the local bodies will *always* understand their local problems and issues better than those people in Albany (starting with parents themselves, then the local schools, then the districts and so on), and actually understanding them inherently gives them an advantage. Even the smartest person in the world can't figure something out if they can't possibly know the issues for each region in the first place. It's a very basic libertarian understanding...the individual knows more about him/herself than the community can, the community knows more about itself than the state can, the state knows more about itself than the nation can. That's why power should be as localized as possible (down to the individual).

There is another aspect to it, but seeing as how I've written too much already, I'll keep it quick...it's that when the state controls education, you only have one model to evaluate. When you have a bunch of different regions in charge of themselves, you'll have a bunch of different models to evaluate. From multiple models, you are much more likely to figure out which are good models and which are bad models.

Yes, I like charter schools as well. But given the ""blueness"" of New York, I'm not sure if talking about charter schools will get a positive or negative reaction. Where I am in California, it seems like when someone says the words ""charter school"", people hear ""I want rich people to kill kids for sport""."
4541,"It‚Äôs not a matter of the fish, it‚Äôs the fact that Lake Erie is *fucking gross*. It was never the cleanest lake, but when I was a kid that was more a joke then true. Now, most of the summer there is a local ‚Äúno swim‚Äù advisory. 

I also live right by two separate power plants that are right on the water, one being the Fermi II Nuclear Power Plant, so yeah, it‚Äôs not the safest place to eat or swim.

4546,"The Human and Chimp Topoisomerase 2A proteins are practically identical.  Same for the ZNF136 protein which is in the family KRAB-SNF protein.

So the argument goes, since creatures like chimps and humans have virtually idenical genes, they must share a common ancestor, otherwise the similarity is by common design. 

But there is another angle to decide between common descent and common design, that is orphan proteins/genes or 
better yet taxonomically restrictred genes/proteins (TRGs).

KRAB-ZNF protein families appear only in Sarcopterygian fish and land animal Tetrapods.  KRAB-ZNFs sort of poofed onto the scene. 

So here we have a family of proteins that really share much similarity to any other set of creatures, they are
orphan to that group.  They don't have a common ancestor, and the probability of such a protein and SIMULTANEOUSLY 
The Chromatin remodelling targets and systems which KRAB-ZNFs interact with is astronomically improbable.


One could argue common descent, plus a few poofed in specially created proteins and the systems they are a part of, but then the irony would be Universal Common Ancestry needs miracles of special creation to rescue it.

Buffalo seeing economic gains from Great Lakes restoration efforts
By	T.J. Pignataro | Published September 25, 2018 | Updated September 25, 2018
 
 
There's a payoff to cleaning up the Great Lakes, and in Buffalo it's higher than most other places.

A University of Michigan study released Tuesday found that for every dollar the U.S. government spends on restoring Lake Erie, Lake Ontario and other water bodies, the Buffalo area could see more than $4 of additional economic gain through the next couple of decades.

Only Detroit and part of the Chicago metropolitan area had higher potential payoffs.

The economic benefits come not just from the cleanup work but on the tourism, recreation and waterfront development that follows.

For Buffalo, the report cited real estate and commercial development at RiverWorks, Canalside and the Ohio Street corridor housing complexes as examples of the spinoff economic benefits of the federal funding.


‚ÄúIt confirms what we‚Äôve known for a long time, which is you can‚Äôt build a waterfront on a polluted waterway,‚Äù said Rep. Brian Higgins, a proponent of the program and waterfront restoration and development. ‚ÄúThat would never have occurred without the effort to clean up the waterway.‚Äù

The University of Michigan economists studied the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, a federal program initiated during the Bush administration and launched during the Obama administration.

The program provided funds to help restore the Buffalo River, launch fish and wildlife initiatives in Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, and reduce harmful algal blooms, invasive species and water pollution.

The researchers estimated the local multiplier effect ‚Äì the increase in monies generated from an initial investment ‚Äì will be $4.09 in economic benefit for every $1 put toward environmental restoration between 2010 and 2036. Detroit‚Äôs multiplier effect was estimated to be $4.29. Waukegan, Ill., located 35 miles north of downtown Chicago, had an even higher multiplier: $4.33.

""The 4-to-1 return on the GLRI investment demonstrated in Buffalo is much larger than a traditional economic development project,"" said Jill Jedlicka, executive director of Buffalo Niagara Waterkeeper. ""And, it supports Waterkeeper's 'Rust-to-Blue' theory that investments in the health of our natural systems and quality of life are investments in the health of our regional economy.""

Overall, economists found that for every dollar the federal government invested in Great Lakes Restoration Initiative programs between 2010 and 2016 produced an average of $3.35 in additional economic activity in the Great Lakes, and it is expected to continue through 2036.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre seeing the impacts now,‚Äù said Gabriel Ehrlich, a University of Michigan researcher on the study‚Äôs project team.

MULTIPLIER EFFECTDOWNLOAD CSV
So far, about $2.9 billion of federal restoration funds have been spent in the Great Lakes across 4,000 projects.

The projects include:

Cleaning up toxic hot spots, including legacy industrial sites like the Buffalo River
Stopping invasive species from getting into the Great Lakes and controlling those that are here
Eliminating water pollution and nutrient loading from phosphorus that generate harmful algal blooms
Restoring diverse, native habitats, some of which included the Buffalo River and Buffalo Harbor
‚ÄúThis study moves our understanding of the impacts of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative from anecdotal to comprehensive,‚Äù Mike Shriberg, executive director of the National Wildlife Federation‚Äôs Great Lakes Regional Center. ‚ÄúThe GLRI is not only stimulating regional economies, but is also transforming waterfronts and generating community pride.‚Äù


Other cities in the study include: Erie, Pa.; Ashtabula, Ohio; Muskegon, Mich.; Sheboygan, Wis.; Duluth, Minn.; and Superior, Wis.

‚ÄúThis program has proven to be critical to broaden economic development goals,‚Äù Alesha Washington, director of the Great Lakes Metro Chambers Coalition, said during a morning conference call among economists and reporters.

The study found that developers, local residents and tourists are all using Buffalo‚Äôs waterfront for recreation. It noted that 89 new apartments have been added.

And, the study pointed out Buffalo‚Äôs ‚Äúten-fold increase‚Äù in waterfront events in 2016 that drew more than 1.5 million people downtown.

The study found millennials are attracted to Buffalo.

‚ÄúBuffalo‚Äôs millennial population has increased by 12 percent ‚Äì five percent more than the rest of the state of New York,‚Äù the study said.

That‚Äôs one of the statistics that resonated with Higgins.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the first time in 40 years, Buffalo‚Äôs young population is going up, not going down,‚Äù Higgins said.

The ambitious plans for the waterfront ‚Äì and their rapid execution ‚Äì shocked even some the region‚Äôs most optimistic people.


Buffalo Niagara Waterkeeper‚Äôs Jedlicka remembers the announcement by Buffalo RiverWorks.

‚ÄúEven seven years ago, I remember walking the site and thinking they were crazy,‚Äù Jedlicka told the study's authors. ‚ÄúBasically, what they had told us at that time is because we had started to get this river cleanup underway on the Buffalo River, it gave them the confidence to start to invest early with their private resources.‚Äù

That energy has spread up and down the Buffalo River, from Canalside to the Old First Ward and into the Valley.

Higgins cited the development of a $30 million hotel at the former Donovan state office building and the $220 million development of Buffalo HarborCenter.

There‚Äôs Tewksbury Lodge on Ohio Street, the Buffalo River Landing and the Cooperage, an Ellicott Development project underway in the former E. &amp; B. Holmes Machinery Company on Chicago Street.


The study found the restoration has spurred development, tourism and increased land values in spots that were once depressed.

It also provided hard data for local organizations like Visit Buffalo Niagara.

‚ÄúWe know a more vibrant waterfront is contributing to the enhancement of the Buffalo brand, and its appeal as a destination,‚Äù said Edward J. Healy, vice president of marketing for Visit Buffalo Niagara. ‚ÄúVirtually every major article about Buffalo by visiting travel writers in recent years has mentioned either Canalside, RiverWorks, Silo City or the Outer Harbor, and the activities found in these waterfront hot spots.‚Äù

Healy added: ‚ÄúThere is probably no more potent symbol of the ‚ÄòNew Buffalo‚Äô and the city‚Äôs regeneration than the frenzy of activity on and around the waterfront.‚Äù

What‚Äôs next?

A linear park is in the works by the Western New York Land Conservancy and its partners to connect Canalside with SolarCity.

It‚Äôll be modeled after New York City‚Äôs High Line.

Higgins also pointed to a proposed system of bicycle and pedestrian trails with funding from the Ralph C. Wilson, Jr. Foundation that could connect Canalside with the Old First Ward and the Outer Harbor.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just getting warmed up,‚Äù Higgins said. ‚ÄúI see the next five years changing Buffalo for the next 100 years.‚Äù

Leaders hope the report serves as clear and convincing evidence why Great Lakes restoration needs to continue.

The initiative is in its second four-year phase, which runs through 2019. But, the $300 million annual appropriation has found itself near the chopping block of federal budgets over the last couple of years.

So far, there‚Äôs been enough congressional support to ward off elimination.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a bipartisan effort,‚Äù Higgins said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs more regional than ideological.‚Äù

Last year, when fears arose of cuts by the Trump administration, Republican Rep. Chris Collins declared that program would and should remain in force. He reaffirmed that Tuesday.

‚ÄúThe University of Michigan study is further proof that the Great Lakes are a vital economic and environmental asset for Western New York,‚Äù Collins said. ‚ÄúAnd, protecting the Great Lakes will continue to be a key priority of mine.‚Äù"
4551,It's been chemically enriched by Lake Erie's industrial waste.
4552,New Ohioan here at the opposite end of the state. Do people swim in Lake Erie? Is it ever warm enough?
4553,"https://www.tmj4.com/news/local-news/39-of-water-foxconn-takes-from-lake-michigan-will-not-return-to-lake

FoxConn is going to be utilizing roughly 5% of the water that flows over Niagara Falls each day, and not returning ~2% of that water (the total, not of 5%). There's a strong chance that they're going to be contributing in a non-insignificant manner to contamination of the water, and also contributing substantially to the temperature of the water (which directly contributes in some ways to algal blooms).

I don't believe that there will be proper precautions in place for cooling, and so effectively we're going to see a non-trivial amount of water leaving the system, a large amount of heat energy entering the system, and the potential for industrial contaminants that are generally highly regulated. Generally speaking, these companies receive regulatory loopholes due to unforeseen weather related circumstances - meaning that e.g. during the Spring or periods of heavy rain, Foxconn may be legally allowed to dump amounts of completely raw waste into the watershed. 

The impact is certainly going to be much more minimal than if the factory were to e.g. be built in Cleveland, but unfortunately we're at the ass end of Lake Erie which leads to many of our beach related maladies."
4554,"Yes. In Ohio right now the ""algae bloom"" is a big issue on lake erie. A lot of the blame is being placed a farmer's feet. While huge factory farms MAY play a role in this the ones being punished by sanctions will end up being the smaller farmers. We're forced to take classes(that we have to pay for) to teach us how to ""safely"" spray our manure on our own fields. Factory farms can afford to do this, but it is a ridiculous waste of time and money off the farm for most of us. Thankfully, I am starting to see a slow shift to people wanting meat that has been ethically raised and humanely slaughtered, so those of us who can't afford to raise huge amounts of animals are starting to at least get a corner of the market back."
4555,Now I'm gonna be a little grossed out every time I go in Lake Erie...
4556,Hey northeast Ohio and yes Lake Erie is very gross toxic btw warnings every year
4557,"Far healthier?

Then why are you only supposed to eat fish from Lake Erie four times a month?"
4558,"For starters, there is no uniform limit on lake erie fish. You can eat more then 4 servings of numerous species. It heavily depends on the type of fish and where you caught it, as well as the age of the fish and whether or not you are pregnant, or are considering pregnancy. The 2018 NY state fishing regulations magazine has a chart available, although I can't find mine at the moment.

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, farm raised fish have plenty of toxins of their own. The same dietery restrictions generally exist for farmed fish as they would for lake erie fish. How much you should eat will depend on the type of fish, where it was farmed and other factors. The cheap tilapia you buy in the grocery store is fed the cheapest possible trash that keep the fish just barely healthy enough to make it to slaughter. In order to keep so many fish in such a small area alive, they are pumped full of antibiotics and the water is doused with regular pesticides.

&amp;#x200B;

Not to mention it tastes like crap. I'll have the delicious homegrown fish if I can get it.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:** There are major dietary restrictions for farmed fish as well, some lake erie fish can def be eaten more then 4 times a month."
4559,Not forced anymore since Kasich started making decisions on my body for me. Also fuck the flat piece of shit. Lake Erie is the only redeeming part and I've called Ohio my residence for 15 years.
4560,"If you want beautiful beaches with fine, white sand I would highly recommend taking a weekend trip to a coastal town in West Michigan. Unfortunately, Ohio‚Äôs Lake Erie coast has some of the worst sand (rocky, gritty, not fine and pure) among all of the Great Lakes."
4561,"It's definitely an important part of designing any new developments right now. Most new subdivisions are going to have a pile of ditching and sewer running to wet/dry ponds. Some do it well, some seem more like they are just ticking off boxes on a list somewhere.

Infrastructure remediation is a major field. A lot of the older parts of cities like Toronto or Kingston have combined sewer systems where sewage and storm water are combined into one pipe. This can overload wastewater treatment plants during heavy rain falls and cause untreated overflows into the lake. These systems are generally being replaced but it's going to take a long time to completely separate them.

Agricultural runoff can create algae blooms which are terrible for lakes. This is a common issue for Lake Erie which is too shallow to really dilute the problem away. There are some provincial programs aiming to create a buffer of land between farms and watercourses to help contain the runoff before it reaches the water. Many cottage country municipalities have toughened up regulations around septic systems near lakes for similar reasons. 

The realignment and renaturalization of the mouth of the Don River in Toronto is an interesting project to help prevent storm flooding in the portlands and provide more green space in the harbour area. The ravines in Toronto have been protected from development since Hurricane Hazel hit in 1954 and killed 81 people in the floodplains of the rivers there. It's an example of a storm having wide ranging urban planning effects and led to the wonderful park system that is there today.

Salt runoff from winter road salting is an interesting problem here. Some creeks can get saltier than the ocean during the spring melt. Spring flooding is an annual issue that makes the news. It was pretty bad in the Ottawa area just in the last month and usually at least starts conversations about land use or watershed controls.

Just a few topics to look into if you are interested. It's very Central Ontario oriented but I'm sure that similar things are happening no matter where you are."
4562,"&gt; Considering that Nuclear Plants have had a meltdown twice in 30 years and Yellowstone Caldera hasnt had one in millennia, I think it is safe to say that Nuclear Reactors are more dangerous.

Scale. Scale is what you need to be worried about. 

The nuclear meltdowns have caused damage fairly localized.  The last time Yellowstone blew it was about 2,000 times bigger than the Mt St Helens eruption and sent roughly 1,000km3 of rock/ash into the sky.

For comparison, 1,000km3 is *two* Lake Eries."
4563,"I've only been to Lake Erie and Virginia Beach. But Lake Erie is, as far as I can tell, the worst place for swimming in America. Not as cold as the other lakes, but you can only go in for ~2 months a year. It's also super polluted everywhere. Virginia beach was amazing, though I went in August, and I suspect it gets pretty cold there if you're looking to *live* on the beach."
4564,"Current direction in Lake Erie has a lot to do with it.   It results in much sandier natural beaches on the north shore, in Ontario.  On the south shore in OH/PA/NY, sand won't accumulate without a manmade groin, or a natural peninsula or outcrop (Presque Isle, etc.), to stop longshore sand migration."
4565,"Nope we're just as fucked as you. The only green space that exists in southern ontario is for drainage. And due to shitty crop prices farmers are bulldozing forests for more growing space. Right up to the water. Yet they cry every spring when their land is eroded by floods. They literally farm right up to the edge of the 200ft bluffs on lake erie. It's impossible to even imagine the landscape as it was.

I think the most effective environmental policy would be outlawing any development within 200 meters on either side of a natural drainage area. But no one wants to be told what to do with their land..."
4566,"Just take a 45 minute drive to Lake Erie instead. Port Dover, or there are lots of other beaches/places along the lakeshore to swim east or west of port dover."
4567,Check for a TMDL study that measured that as a contaminant of concern? That‚Äôs probably not a routine chemical to screen for though.
4568,"That is a goal, not a specific method by which to achieve that goal. 


Are you proposing PERMANENTLY drawing all of the Great Lakes down by several meters during any average or dry year, *just in case* the following year(s) MIGHT BE wetter than average, whether or not such a ""solution"" is physically or economically feasible?


How precisely do you propose increasing the discharge rates from Lake Erie, Lake St. Clair, Lake Huron and Lake Michigan in order to lower their water levels?


Are you aware that increasing the discharges from the Upper Great Lakes would INCREASE the water flowing into Lake Ontario during those average or dry years?

Conversely, how precisely do you propose to decrease the discharge rates from Lake Erie, Lake St. Clair, Lake Huron and Lake Michigan during wet years in order to reduce the discharge of their waters into Lake Ontario?


And if your only solution is to draw Lake Ontario down by several meters by instituting massive discharges into the St. Lawrence River during normal or dry periods (While doing nothing about the inflows to the lake), how do you plan to protect the communities along the river from the inevitable flooding that would occur?


Additionally, such a plan would absolutely devastate local economies along Lake Ontario which depend heavily on lake based shipping, tourism, fishing, etc... Such a plan would also render as completely useless m,any harbors and virtually every single private and commercial boat slip, dock, beach and water system which have been designed rely upon the normal lake levels."
4569,"They've destroyed entire island ecosystems here in the states and Canada also. There are quite a few articles on the damage done to islands in the Great Lakes.

4582,"Speaking from Lake Erie's perspective, our water way is severely polluted, particularly around the costs were you would expect to see River Otter overlap. There demographics are certainly down due to over-commercialization and other direct/indirect human effects. Its kind of disheartening when our state legislature doesnt declare it 'in distress' when it clearly is. I'm not as nuanced with Lake Michigan, but i would imagine this would be even more profound in Chicago as its a more industrial and much larger city in general. There are no River otters anywhere close to the metropolitan cleveland area. They mainly stay in adjacent counties of Lake, Ashtabula, etc. Would you say this mimics your sightings?

Edit: As for adaptation, human introduced barriers are much more sudden then those nature presents. It would be difficult for them to adapt to the constant changes that humans present. Without realization of our interactions with the environment, animals wont have time to adapt. They will simply die off. I wouldnt expect to see open water versions you mention, for these reasons. The only change we will see is if we make conscious efforts to embolden them and extend their habitats. Not sure introducing, what would be, an apex predator like a large otter or seal would be particularly good for these Lakes as they have no natural predators there. Nature is tough to balance, we can only look to minimize our impacts on animals, both the positive and negative ones."

That good ship and crew was a bone to be chewed
When the gales of November came early
The ship was the pride of the American side
Coming back from some mill in Wisconsin
As the big freighters go, it was bigger than most
With a crew and good captain well seasoned
Concluding some terms with a couple of steel firms
When they left fully loaded for Cleveland
And later that night when the ship's bell rang
Could it be the north wind they'd been feelin'?
The wind in the wires made a tattle-tale sound
And a wave broke over the railing
And every man knew, as the captain did too,
T'was the witch of November come stealin'

When the gales of November came slashin'
When afternoon came it was freezin' rain
In the face of a hurricane west wind
When suppertime came, the old cook came on deck sayin'
Fellas, it's too rough to feed ya
At seven pm a main hatchway caved in, he said
Fellas, it's been good t'know ya
The captain wired in he had water comin' in
And the good ship and crew was in peril
And later that night when his lights went outta sight
Came the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald
Does any one know where the love of God goes
When the waves turn the minutes to hours?
The searches all say they'd have made Whitefish Bay
If they'd put fifteen more miles behind her
They might have split up or they might have capsized
They may have broke deep and took water
And all that remains is the faces and the names
Of the wives and the sons and the daughters
Lake Huron rolls, superior sings
In the rooms of her ice-water mansion
Old Michigan steams like a young man's dreams
The islands and bays are for sportsmen
And farther below Lake Ontario
Takes in what Lake Erie can send her
And the iron boats go as the mariners all know
With the gales of November remembered
In a musty old hall in Detroit they prayed,
In the maritime sailors' cathedral
The church bell chimed till it rang twenty-nine times
For each man on the Edmund Fitzgerald
The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down
Of the big lake they call 'gitche gumee'

Not appropriately scaled, which is the problem. The total land area required and water required is obscenely big. Have you looked at a map? Do you know how big Lake Michigan is? Lake Erie? Lake Superior? You're talking about adding pumped storage equal in land area to one or more of these lakes. It's impossible, and it would be an enviornmental disaster if anyone tried.

Also, what is the source of carbon in your power to gas scheme? Atmospheric CO2? Did you cost that too? Last I checked, such technology is unproven, albeit promising results have come out of R&amp;D.

Are you concerned about methane leaks undoing any global Green House gas gains made? Because I am.

I will look at your notes. I cannot yet dismiss this new plan out of hand, but I'm still really skeptical. If it was this easy and cheap, why are they not already doing it in California?

So we'll dick around with funds for wetlands and ""research and data collection"" and things will get worse and worse until DeWine leaves office and someone else finally says ""enough"". Same as Florida's red tide. And this makes sure no one can sue while it gets worse.

[Blue-green algae bloom in Lake Erie this year to be among worst ever.](https://windsorstar.com/news/local-news/blue-green-algae-bloom-in-lake-erie-this-year-to-be-among-worst-ever)

Remember this when we're all buying bottled water this summer. Thank the farmers, who we just bailed out with another $16B. They all have well water and resent city folk, they don't give half a shit."
4593,"Also keep in mind that only about ~1/3 of Ohio is within the Lake Erie watershed.  So we have politicians and constituents that are not directly affected by the ""rights"" of Erie, or would ever be truly susceptible to legal action based on the LEBOR.  But yet they'll still vote against it.  If that's not overreach..."
4594,"While this might sound good in theory, it‚Äôs not. I live in northwest Ohio and a few years back we had a water crisis. Algae blooms in Lake Erie right around the area of our water intake. Even towns who got their water from the Maumee river were screwed over. Water was GONE. There was nothing in stores. We had to drive miles to obscure gas stations or buy massive bags of ice to melt. Our water treatment system is not sound enough to get rid of water bottles."
4595,Must be that dirty lake Erie water.
4596,"Here in NW Ohio, we get problems with algae blooms in the summer since we get our water from Lake Erie. The algae produce microcystine, which ends up in our water and is dangerous. That makes our water unsafe to drink at times, and a Brita water pitcher won't filter that out.  We need bottled water for the instances where the blooms are out of control. Also, when it's not above the specified cutoff, the water is still pumped full of chlorine to kill the regular amounts of micro cystine.  It tastes awful."
4597,"yea in the 1960's the Cuyahoga river which runs through Cleveland and into lake Erie became so polluted that oil began settling on top of the water. It eventually caught on fire in the 1960's and was a huge embarrassment to the city. It's mentioned in a lot of songs about Cleveland...

The Buffalo River and Cleveland are not near each other.

When I left there in 73 the aircraft flew over where the Cuyahoga entered the lake. There was a multicolored plume entering an already brown lake. 

I had the opportunity to go back there about 6 years ago and visited the lake. The waves coming ashore were no longer brown and it looked like you could see the bottom several feet down. There was still a sign saying no swimming because the bacteria levels were high. Some progress I guess. When I was leaving, the aircraft again flew over the confluence and there wasn‚Äôt a noticeable difference in water color."

4641,"That's great. Here's an idea: we're finally starting to wake up to the fact that there's a problem with plastic in the oceans. There are a lot of things we need to do to solve this problem. We need to tackle the existing issue, but we should probably also tackle the root cause. 

Every time some 'plastic in the oceans' story comes up, about an idealistic upstart that intends to make a machine to remove it all or some heroic young girl who diligently walks the beach picking it up and bagging it, piece by piece, very little discussion is had about how the plastic got there in the first place; that we've been using the oceans as garbage dumps for quite some time now and we just can't continue to do that. 

As a boy, I remember when Lake Erie basically died.  All the heavy industry that surrounded it had been dumping fucktons of chemicals and contaminants  into it for decades and it became a polluted nightmare. Then, we realized that was terribly wrong, then we started instituting policies to stop it and now, it's not perfect, but it's WAY better. The solution there was stopping the polluting. 

Can we start talking about that a bit more? That maybe, using the oceans as national dumpsters isn't such a good idea?

And then, as is par for developing effective policy, we identify the mechanisms of action that are causing it to occur? 

Then we go a layer deeper and identify the actors that are participating in it occurring? 

Then we use the force of law to stop the behavior? 

I mean, this formula isn't magic."

No, the actual War on Drugs started with Nixon. Yes, there was legislation like the Harrison Act and the Marijuana Tax Act before 1970. I don't agree with these laws at all, and resent the government for using racist propaganda to push oppressive drug laws (associating opium with Chinese and weed with Mexicans and Blacks).

I am just trying to figure out where the best place for clean groundwater is a serious chore between that and the *Marcellus Shale fracking, chemical companies, superfund sites, industrial sites, nuclear sites, medium to large cities, big agriculture, landfills* etc. It seems to be a daunting task.

4652,"I just found out radon was such a big issue for people. I guess something like 1 in 3 homes can have elevated radon levels. I moved into a new house recently and had to have it tested for radon because it is close to Lake Erie since radon comes from the breakdown of uranium in soil, rock, and water. Radon moves up through your basement and into your home. Sure enough there were elevated levels of radon so we had to have one of those exhaust systems put in.

[Radon Facts](https://www.radon.com/radon_facts/)

Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas and comes from the natural breakdown (radioactive decay) of uranium. It is usually found in igneous rock and soil, but in some cases, well water may also be a source of radon."
4653,"Like another user said, I want to believe global warming raising the levels of the nearby Lake St. Clair or Lake Erie to the point where Ferndale became a bay.

Even the river in the final scenes where Kara's crossing the border looks like a far wider channel than the Detroit River IRL.

Global warming, melting ice caps, heavier rainfall from climate craziness... I can definitely buy the lakes rising and swallowing parts of the city...

Or perhaps something man-made, like... to combat rising lake/river levels, they dammed off sections of city that they figured were ""expendable"" and just let it flood.

But the most likely answer is that they didn't know the Ferndale district wasn't on the riverside or lake bay and it's an error of some sort.

Being that the bosses were worried about the guests, me and a couple of the line cooks went out on the dock and watched the storm, saw three of these I would guess half a mile to a mile out.

This same thing occurred in lake Erie when houses put up sea walls to stop the erosion of their property. The lack of erosion there caused sand point at point pellee national park to basically disappear. That spit of land was within a few miles of Ohio at one point.

You just seem to be completely underestimsting how much 200 million tons of silt a year is. In the first 30 years after the lock system was created (1930) the delta lost 1700 square miles during a time when the earth was in a cooling period. 

Additionally, a major part of hurricane damage occurs because of the loss of the sand bars, and barrier islands that used to protect population centers from waves. You could literally convert the world to renewables, and cool the climate at the fastest pace on record; but within 100 years new Orleans will be an isolated island in the gulf of mexico (delta will have receeded).

The delta is now subsiding at a rate of 5-7mm a year. The sea is rising (ipcc) at 1-2mm a year. It used to gain land at 5-10mm a year."

&gt;Because of water contaminants including mercury and PCBs, it is important to limit the amount of certain fish you consume from the Cuyahoga River and Lake Erie. Exceeding the amount of advised consumption may cause health problems.

http://epa.ohio.gov/dsw/fishadvisory/index

&gt;Overall Fish Consumption Advice

&gt;**Two meals per week** Yellow perch, sunfish (e.g., bluegill, green, longear, redear)*

&gt;**One meal per week**	All fish not specified in this table
One meal per month	Flathead catfish 23"" and over, northern pike 23"" and over, steelhead trout from Lake Erie and its tributaries


&gt;*Consumption of these species should be limited to one meal per week from: Ashtabula River, Cuyahoga River, Mahoning River, Nesmith Lake, Ohio Canal, Ohio River, and West Branch Reservoir; and as otherwise indicated in the Ohio Sport Fish Consumption Advisory booklet."

4684,"Not really sure where this guy is getting his numbers, nor am I a vegan, but his statements regarding industrial farming are correct in a way. Especially regarding livestock. The industry / animals, produce a 'shit' ton of CO2 and methane in our atmosphere. The environmental affects that their built up waste / fecal matter create in the immediate area of these farms, is also something worth noting. Fertlization and pesticide sprays used on agricultural farms, can also cause significant run off into water sheds, rivers, and lakes. The algal bloom that is plagueing Lake Erie, and the southern parts of Lake Huron currently are largely caused by this factor. The author's connections between 'not eating animal product' and the eventual decline in industrialized animal farming are fairly assumed, however missing out on some key factors. A good number of industrialized farms are part of very large organizations / corporations. The success of which has a large impact on our economy. I dont believe that simply 'going vegan' will negatively affect these farms financially. There's too much of a stake in them.. and our government has proven just how much it doesn't like seeing big industry fail, if it ever got to that point."

You couldn't even swim in it for a long time.  Even now, there are days when the beaches are closed due to bacteria outbreaks or otherwise.

4721,"Cleveland, OH reporting in. Here are a few things I've noticed since I moved here 10 years ago:

* Serious decline in road infrastructure. Despite being caused by the extremes in weather we see up here, the local government's ability to stay on top of it seems to be getting noticeable worse.According to [an article from a couple of years ago ](https://www.cityclub.org/blog/2016/01/04/what-would-it-take-to-fix-cleveland-s-roads) they were spending only 3% of what it would take to fix the existing infrastructural problems. Anecdotally, I would say the situation has only worsened since then.

* Water quality concerns. Despite the utility companies assuring us that our water quality is fine and that there's nothing to worry about, the phosphorous-induced toxic algae blooms in Lake Erie returned in 2004 and [are an ongoing issue](https://amp.detroitnews.com/amp/779473002). For those of you who don't know, these are clusters or ""blooms"" of cyanobacteria that can produce dangerous toxins, and people living within half a mile of lakes with algae blooms are [2.3 times more likely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanobacteria#Health_risks) to develop ALS, or Lou Gehrig's Disease. Note to self: move up move out date.

* Financial struggles are increasing. As with most places in the U.S. [prices are increasing](https://www.bls.gov/regions/midwest/summary/blssummary_cleveland_oh.pdf); Cleveland however falls below the national average for wages and our unemployment rate is higher than average. It doesn't take an economics student to see that this discrepancy between wage-earning and price increase spells trouble ahead. The more I research this the more I see that Cleveland mirrors national trends relatively closely on most graphs, we're just doing so in a generally worse manner by most metrics. Anecdotally most of my coworkers and friends are struggling, a evidenced by many of them looking for side jobs, joining pyramid schemes and in launching their own businesses - most of them don't have a passion for business or new product mind you - the main reason is always ""I need extra sources of income"".

This is my first M.O. thread so I'm not sure if this I'm doing this correctly!"
4722,Lake Erie should be protected at all costs. It's our best natural resource and our main tourist destination. I even think it has the potential to develop into a bigger tourist destination if we take care of it better.
4723,"Mmmm, Lake Erie. Shallow, polluted, and stagnant. "
4724,"Huh, I wonder how

Edit: If anyone else is interested where they got their numbers

&gt; Uranium milling and mining can poison and kill hundreds of
&gt; birds per facility per year. Indeed, in early 2008 the Cotter Corporation
&gt; was fined $40,000 for the death of 40 geese and ducks at the
&gt; Ca√±on City Uranium Mill in Colorado. The birds apparently ingested
&gt; contaminated water at one of the settling ponds at the uranium
&gt; mine [1]. These deaths can be very roughly quantified into 0.006
&gt; deaths per GWh. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service [31] has also
&gt; noted that abandoned open pit uranium mines in Wyoming can
&gt; form pit lakes hazardous to wildlife. Uranium-bearing formations
&gt; are usually associated with strata containing high concentrations of
&gt; selenium. It is not uncommon for these pits to kill 300 birds per
&gt; year. Because those mines operated at about one-tenth the
&gt; efficiency of Canon City, they would correlate to about 0.45 deaths
&gt; per GWh. Taking the mean from both uranium mines gets us 0.228
&gt; fatalities per GWh.
&gt; Like fossil fueled power stations and wind farms, avian fauna
&gt; can also collide with nuclear power plants. Three thousand birds
&gt; died in two successive nights in 1982 from collisions with smokestacks
&gt; and cooling towers at Florida Power Corporation‚Äôs Crystal
&gt; River Generating Facility [1]. Given that the power plant now hosts
&gt; an 838 MW nuclear reactor, and presuming it operated with
&gt; a capacity factor of 90% and that the 3000 deaths were the only
&gt; ones throughout the year, the facility was responsible for 0.454
&gt; avian deaths per GWh. Ornithologists observed 274 fatal bird
&gt; collisions with an elevated cooling tower at the Limerick nuclear
&gt; power plant in Pennsylvania from 1979 to 1980 [32]. Since the
&gt; Limerick plant has a 1200 MW reactor, and also assuming it operated
&gt; at a 90% capacity factor, it was responsible for 0.261 deaths per
&gt; GWh. At the Susquehanna plant in eastern Pennsylvania, 1500 dead
&gt; birds were collected between 1978 and 1986 for an average of 187
&gt; fatalities per year [33]. Assuming that the 2200 MW plant operated
&gt; at 90% capacity factor, it was responsible for 0.01 deaths per GWh.
&gt; Extensive surveys for dead birds were also conducted at the
&gt; Davis-Bess nuclear plant near Lake Erie in Northern Ohio. Ornithologists
&gt;  recorded a total of 1554 bird fatalities or an average of 196 per year from 1972 to 1979 [33]. Given that the power plant
&gt; hosts an 873 MW reactor, and assuming it operated with a 90%
&gt; capacity factor, and the plant was responsible for 0.0285 fatalities
&gt; per GWh. Taking the mean for each of the four power plants results
&gt; in 0.188 deaths per GWh.
&gt; The total avian deaths per GWh for nuclear power plants are
&gt; therefore about 0.416

4738,"I am more worried about pollution than climate change. I think climate change has taken away from the importance and urgency of pollution.

Plastic is in a lot of water sources, like a shit ton, and it ends up in a lot of our food and drinking water. Micro particles of plastic are small enough that they don't get filtered by our water filtering systems and they don't get filtered by our kidneys and end up directly in our blood.

Then there is polluted food grown in China, and pesticide use virtually everywhere.

Lake Erie is totally fucked because of run off from pesticides; algae blooms. We should all be worried about our drinking water and how much plastic/ toxins we are consuming in our food/drinks.

But NOPE, everyone's worried about the earth heating up. It's like pollution stopped being a problem in the 1990's. We are toxifying our planet, who gives a shit about climate change when we are literally consuming poison right now.

Also no one knows what the effects are going to be from how much plastic we consume, we'll find out in a couple decades, could be benign, could cause lots of problems. Toxins are generally linked to cancer, and I think we're going to see a heavy rise in cancer in a couple decades after enough of it has accumulated in our bodies.

Another thing is nuclear waste, acid rain, and garbage dumps. This world is getting trashed and people forgot to even give a shit about that stuff because of some ice caps melting.

All bottled water and bottled beverages in plastic contain micro particles of plastic, all of them, they're very hard to filter and the ocean already has ridiculously high concentrations of it. This is all stuff that is proven and happening right now, it's not a ""what if"" like climate change.

February 20 at 1:57 PM ¬∑ 
NEXT TUESDAY‚ÄôS ELECTION IN TOLEDO - Should Lake Erie Have Legal Rights? #Yes4LakeErie

Something unprecedented is happening in Toledo, Ohio. On February 26, voters there will be asked to approve the Lake Erie Bill of Rights (starts on page 4), a ballot initiative that would make it possible for citizens to sue those who pollute the lake for damages. The proposal is controversial, quite possibly unconstitutional, but passionately supported by environmental activists who are tired of watching state and federal officials stand by with their hands in the pockets while the Earth‚Äôs 11th largest lake slowly dies from man made pollution. In essence, the ballot question asks whether Lake Erie has the legal right ‚Äúto exist, flourish, and naturally evolve.‚Äù

The City of Toledo depends on Lake Erie for its drinking water. In 2014, phosphorous pouring into the lake from nearby farms made the city‚Äôs drinking water unfit for human consumption for three long days in the middle of summer. According to the New York Times, ‚ÄúStores closed. Hospitals accepted only the most seriously ill patients. Restaurants were empty. And some 500,000 people depended on bottled water in the middle of a brutally hot August.‚Äù

In recent years, Lake Erie has been covered in green algae that sickened swimmers and dogs. The slicks were large enough to see from space. Yet the ballot initiative is pitting members of the community against each other. Everyone agrees that farms near the lake are largely responsible for the phosphorous and other runoff from fertilizers that cause the algae blooms and undrinkable water. But much of the local economy depends on those same farmers for its existence, especially at a time when the automakers who used to employ tens of thousands of area residents have reduced their operations in an around Toledo dramatically.

Forcing People To Confront The Problem

Thomas Linzey is the executive director of the Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund, a nonprofit group based in Pennsylvania that helped write the Toledo ballot initiative. He says it has two objectives. One, to send a warning the community is fed up with a lack of state and federal action to protect Lake Erie. Two, to force the courts to recognize that ecosystems like the lake ‚Äúpossess independent rights to survive and be healthy.‚Äù He says, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no precedent for any of this. It is almost a new consciousness ‚Äî that a community is not just Homo sapiens.‚Äù

Actually, there is a tiny bit of legal justification on the side of the environmental activists, but it is a very slender reed indeed to build an argument around. In 1972, Supreme Court justice William O. Douglas, one of the most fearsome intellects to ever sit on the court, wrote a dissent in the case of Sierra Club v. Morton in which the majority rejected a claim that the natural world has legal rights.

Douglas disagreed, writing, ‚ÄúContemporary public concern for protecting nature‚Äôs ecological equilibrium should lead to the conferral of standing upon environmental objects to sue for their own preservation.‚Äù Such willingness to ‚Äúfind‚Äù novel legal principles buried within the language of the Constitution is, of course, anathema to conservative judges spoon fed on the absurd theory of ‚Äúoriginalism‚Äù that permeates many of the seminal cases decided by the Court this century.

A 15-Year Campaign

Linzey‚Äôs group began working with towns and cities to protect local natural resources 15 years ago. Since then the idea that nature has rights has won support in dozens of municipalities ‚Äî from cities with long histories of environmental activism to unexpected places like Tamaqua, Pennsylvania in the heart of that state‚Äôs coal mining region. It became the first place in the nation to approve a rights-of-nature ordinance in 2006 after it banned companies from dumping dredged minerals and sewage sludge into open pit mines.

Four years later, Pittsburgh approved a rights-of-nature ordinance that prohibited fracking in city limits. Santa Monica, California, has since passed an ordinance that requires the city to ‚Äúrecognize the rights of people, natural communities and ecosystems to exist, regenerate and flourish.‚Äù Earlier this year, the White Earth Band of the Ojibwe tribe in Minnesota announced that it had granted wild rice its own legal rights, including ‚Äúthe right to pure water.‚Äù

Demonizing Farmers Is Not The Answer

The Toledo ballot initiative has created political fault lines in the community. Yvonne Lesicko, vice president for public policy for the Ohio Farm Bureau acknowledges that farms are the primary contributors to the algae blooms and pollution afflicting Lake Erie. But she also points out other sources of harmful runoff include lawns, septic systems, and golf courses.

Farmers are trying to limit fertilizer and pesticide use, she says, but changes may take up to 20 years to come to fruition. Can the lake wait that long? She suggests the ballot initiative is not a reasoned response to what is a very complex problem. ‚ÄúWe care very much about the lake,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúBut this is not a solution. In fact, it is counterproductive. This is going to lead to lots of lawsuits and stress.‚Äù

City political leaders are conflicted about the ballot question. On one hand, Lake Erie is vital to what makes Toledo a place where people want to live. On the other, the city could be forced to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on legal fees to defend itself against legal challenges to the new policy if it is approved by voters.

‚ÄúI think everybody is frustrated,‚Äù Nick Komives, a member of the Toldeo city council, tells the NY Times. He says he supports a clean lake but opposed the ballot initiative because it could drain city finances. ‚ÄúThe initiative is a powerful tactic. And for me, coming from an activist background, it is important to send messages. But this is probably unconstitutional.‚Äù

Capitalism And Sustainability

There is an old, fairly crude expression that goes like this: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt shit where you eat and you don‚Äôt eat where you shit.‚Äù This seems so obvious that it hardly bears repeating. Yet since the first colonists set foot in North America, the waterways have been used as little more than sewer pipes for carrying industrial, agricultural, and residential wastes to nearby rivers and lakes that carry them on to the oceans.

People may argue about whether human activity has contributed to a warming climate but there can be no debate that algae blooms and phosphorous contamination are caused by human activity. Where did the notion originate that people could treat the environment like a community toilet and never have to suffer the consequences?

Certainly the indigenous peoples knew better than to shit where they eat. What is it about colonizers that makes them think they can destroy the things that make life possible ‚Äî clean air, clean water, and clean land ‚Äî with impunity? If the native culture had prevailed, people and nature would have continued to live in harmony. Of course, their would be no interstate highways and SUVs, but the environment wouldn‚Äôt be contributing to shortened lifespans and sickness either.

An analogy could be drawn between putting a price on dumping harmful products into the environment and putting a price on the carbon dioxide that pours into the atmosphere as the result of human activity. Behavior that has no consequences rapidly becomes antisocial but can be curbed with appropriate pricing signals.

Yes, the Lake Erie ballot initiative in Toledo would forever change how the local community interacts with the land and the water, but why is that a cause for concern? Just because we have been dumping poisons into the lake for hundreds a year, does that give humanity a license to continue doing so in perpetuity? Is there not some point at which people wake up from their centuries old reverie and say, ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt continue to do this anymore?‚Äù

The Lake Erie ballot initiative may or may not pass. If it does, it may or may not survive legal challenges. But it is a sign that attitudes are changing and that caring for the environment is no longer something that appeals just to treehuggers and socialists.

Honestly going to Google there are so many biased websites idk which to believe, I'd rather listen to a few different peoples views and decide from there. To be quite frank all I really know is that there are companies that are heavily polluting our lake and it's time it stops. Alge is good for the lake but in any sense of the term pollution is bad. Especially chemicle filled pollution! It's time the companies polluting find a new way to get rid of waste.

4803,"First question is a very generic question, I usually ask something similar to all the candidates. Why do you want to be secretary of environment, and what kind of directives do you plan to write for the state?

Second question is specific to part of my district which borders Lake Erie. A few years back, we had an algae bloom that caused a lot of the drinking water in the northern Ohio area to be contaminated and undrinkable lest one becomes sick. Do you think that this sort of scenario is still a threat? And if so, what steps would you be willing to take to prevent it from happening again? Note that you shouldn't feel pressured to say it is still a threat, this happened a while ago and I would really just like to ask if you think the work done to prevent it from happening again so far has been enough.

Lastly, a lot of my district takes pride in the mountainous forests of the Appalachians. It would be very sad if thousands of square miles these forests were cut down to make room for sprawling solar and wind power farms. Do you have any plans regarding energy for the state?"

4805,"That's how it was for me. I fully support having a clean Lake Erie, but I wasn't convinced that this bill was the way to do it. It just felt like there had to be a better way to enforce pollution laws than to grant ""rights"" to a body of water and vaguely open up the possibility of lawsuits against people that pollute.

However, the absolute glut of ads that we started getting in the mail (often multiple per day, addressed to the same person) and Facebook ads opposing the measure, felt really suspicious to me. So I ended up voting ""for"" out of spite more than anything."

4807,"There is an emphasis placed on the seperation between urban and green spaces and the importance of isolated interaction with nature, so I'd have to strongly assume that those drainage ditches wouldn't play as impactful of a role as a dedicated park area. 

If there is a benefit experienced from these drainage areas, it'd be of the nature described by Roger S Ulrich in his 1984 paper titled ""Aesthetic and Affective Response to Natural Environment"" where Ulrich talks about the aesthetic response to environmental settings as supporting positive emotional experiences both individually and socially. 

However, I don't think it's the same benefit as gained from isolated park experiences. The drainage system is surrounded by traffic and virtually inaccessible to individuals wishing to immerse themselves in a greenspace. 

""Greenspaces"" aren't necessarily green in colour, either. Here in Southern Ontario we have a place called Longpoint Provincial Park and while there is shrubbery and wetlands surrounding it, the *general* draw is the beach on Lake Erie. 

It's the experience gained from spending time at (in this case) the beach, both with others and alone, that constitute to this improved mental and emotional health. Being able to relax, to occupy yourself in the moment. To choose whether you'd like to be social, to spend time how you personally enjoy spending your time, and to do it on your schedule so that you can leave when you would like.

The nutrients which used to exist within the water column now exists primarily as mussel biomass concentrated on the lake bottom. These mussels in particular aren't a good food source for a majority of the Lake Michigan food web, which will ultimately impact the trophic dynamics of the system. These effects will extend to the fisheries, a huge economic market in the tourism state of Michigan.

Take a look at Lake Erie, that's a water supply for many people and cities from Michigan to New York. Almonds are sucking up tons of water in California that can be used for drinking. Not to mention the all the food that grows here just to be sent to China, uses up our natural resources. At this point, you're just being ignorant. You're real argument is just some morale high ground you feel you have over people, it's stupid, and it sucks. I don't control what people do with their animals no more than you control how much phosperous enters our water. "
4825,Maybe that is it but they seemed to be disappearing before the onset of the mussels.  The mussels did filter Lake Erie really well turning it into an oligotrophic lake.  You can go out there and it looks crystal clear.  Maybe this is what happened.  No zooplankton for the smelt to feed on.  Lots of people say who cares they are non-native but so are steelhead and brown trout.
4826,"Pollution is a problem but not like it was. I live near lake Erie and the same thing happened there. Back then, it wasn't the liberal left or hippies that made a difference. It was the hunters trappers and fishermen that sounded the alarms about it. Those are your true conservationists, the ones that understand how the ecosystem is supposed to be.

4830,"&gt;At the Gathering held at the College of Saint Benedict (St. Joseph, Minnesota), Friends of Color encountered a troubling and hostile environment upon arrival to the campus and throughout most of the scheduled Pre-Gathering Conference of Friends of Color and their families. Friends of Color were warned to avoid going into town without a companion. They were cautioned to limit town excursions to business hours. This warning was further reinforced by actions of racial profiling by the campus security police force.

YOWZA, followed by:

&gt;The first ‚Äúurban‚Äù setting for Gathering chosen by the re-constituted Site Selection Subcommittee of the Long-Range Planning Committee having equal representation of Friends of African descent and Friends of European descent was the 2018 Gathering at the University of Toledo (Toledo, Ohio). During the Lake Erie Yearly Meeting annual sessions, a European-American woman told a Friend of Color that she would not go to the Gathering in Toledo because it would not be safe for her to be there. Toledo, Ohio is a city of approximately 275,000 people with approximately 40% of its population being People of Color. The FGC Gathering has historically been held in communities that are more than 95% European-American. At the FGC Gathering in Toledo, the attendance at Junior Gathering was approximately half its usual size. Was this because European-American families unfortunately decided to stay away because of the location?

I have had no direct involvement with FGC (except for donating to make sure this audit happened!), but this part made me think of my own yearly meeting (which is part of FGC):

&gt;Develop a structure that allows us to more fully receive the spiritual gifts of Friends of Color and Young Adult Friends in all of FGC functions.

My YM tries to have a young adult on each committee. The YAF group says this results in ""the same six people"" being asked to be on way too many committees. We obviously have a lot more YAFs, though. I've never been approached by Nominating Committee. When I did join a committee, it was because I had an excited conversation with the clerk. Asking someone from Nom Com, I was told they only consider people after they are already on a committee or after they start attending annual session.

Uh oh. The way to get on Nom Com's radar is to take 4 days off work and pay like $500 admission? There's a way to make sure decision-making power stays limited to the same few people! And well, I have this hunch that being a convinced Friend keeps you off their radar too. There's no ""Jane Jeffries? Oh, is that Susan Jeffries' daughter?"" familiarity. After all, plenty of people bring their kids to annual session, so if that's what gets you on their radar...

Given the historic demographics of FGC Friends (read: very white), most FGC Friends of Color are probably convinced. And as the report notes, people of color and young adults are less likely to have significant disposable income, which makes annual session attendance more difficult.

&gt;Make the governing body more racially, culturally and age diverse, and consider making it smaller.

And that means not just adding a few people for diversity but actually *having fewer old white people*, which I could see getting pushback."

4836,"The zip code you're in, with respect to lead poisoning, has a lot to do with the *condition* of the house, more so than the age. I am assuming you're in a nicely maintained unit, without peeling paint, crumbling plaster (covered in paint) or deteriorating wallpaper. When the paint-covered walls are in poor condition, people can inhale lead-paint dust and children tend to eat peeled lead paint chip, because lead tastes sweet. 

Your zip code has a lot of impoverished households that can't afford to live in a maintained apartment, and are living in a poorly-maintained slumlord apartment. There a lot of places with holes in the floor, ceiling, walls and peeling wallpaper that slumlords don't fix. Children living in apartments like these inhale and ingest more lead. It's a function of *condition* more so than age, even the more recently developed suburbs are full of pre-1980 homes that likely have lead paint, but these areas aren't hotbeds of slumlording and concentrated poverty. 

&amp;#x200B;

The third way kids ingest lead is through drinking. Throughout the *country* lead service lines were used through the early 1900s, and think of all the cities developed before then. Lead pipes (you can see this in the basement where the line enters the home, if you have them) get a coating, just like copper turns green. This coating prevents lead from dissolving into the water in it. In all the older US cities, the water engineers know about lead service pipes, and make sure the water they produce is the right pH to prevent that coating from dissolving, so the lead stays safely behind the coating. One reason Flint, MI was such a huge scandal is because they switched to a different water source and didn't treat it to make sure it had the right pH - for water engineers it's negligence, this is a basic consideration. In Buffalo, they plan for this and will never switch water sources from Lake Erie. You can also get your water tested by the Erie County health department (I think for free) if you want to be sure. If it is elevated, which also can come from crappy overseas fixtures being made with higher lead content, a national problem, then there are things you could get for your faucet before drinking - fixtures are a national problem. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you're worried, get your water checked and if your apartment is nice without deteriorating walls lead paint won't be a problem."

4838,"Because Lake Erie is so shallow it doesn‚Äôt take as long for the lake itself to be rough enough to capsize boats.

4840,"This has a had a huge impact on low income and working class families which is why you rarely see any urban or rural working class corps anymore.

Specifically the race and gender diversity has dropped extremely from even ten years ago in the Jr. Corps circuit. Gone are the days of corps like Patriots, Americanos, Racine Scouts, Cadets of New York, New York Lancers, Nite Express, Lake Erie Regiment, General Butler's Vagabonds and so many others.

4842,"Honestly I‚Äôm not sure their is one, short of the benevolent dictator, someone that has absolute power but uses it to benefit the people.   Corporations should be able to do what they want, but also should probably have standards for workers, wages and environmental protection.  Nixon started the EPA because all the manufacturers were just polluting the shit out of everything.  See e.g.  Lake Erie, most major river systems in the Midwest.  

For every person that wants to invent the next cure for cancer, flying car, internet, there is another person working just as hard to figure out how they can profit off the work of others.

So, steps in the right direction would be (obviously these are just my opinions, and I am no way arguing that I‚Äôm correct):

1.  Almost all money out of elections.  No corporate donations, campaign funds capped, no pacs or superpacs or whatever else.   Federal elected officials in the US spend half their time in office fund raising.  No wonder nothing gets done.   Campaigns should be weeks long instead of years.  Election Day off. 

1a.  Citizens United needs to go away.  Corporations aren‚Äôt people enough to get money=political speech.  Especially when they then get the loudest speech. 

2.  Overhaul spending for defense contractors.  No more paying before work is even started, no more $1 trillion overages on contracts for a plane that is already obsolete.  No more $400 toilet seat unless it‚Äôs on a sub or plane and they don‚Äôt come any cheaper.  

2a.  To be fair there should also be an overhaul of the social security/Medicaid/Medicare stuff.  But I honestly have no idea how.  There probably needs to be some changes as to retirement age and that kind of thing.  And I don‚Äôt want AIG or Lehman Brothers in charge of it, we see how well that went.  Fraud and overspending are problems but I‚Äôm not sure how pervasive.  It seems like they arrest the doctors committing fraud sooner or later.  

3.  Criminal justice reform, nonviolent offenders shouldn‚Äôt be in prison for 30 years. Ain‚Äôt nobody want to pay for that.  Take some of the money saved and spend it on rehabilitation programs to train people to integrate back into society and better themselves.  And private prisons probably shouldn‚Äôt be in charge of that.  They aren‚Äôt going to zealously work toward having less ‚Äúcustomers.‚Äù

4.  Either a robust single payer system or socialize medicine.  Something to actually drive the cost side of the equation down.  There‚Äôs no reason we should have the worst healthcare system in the first world when it‚Äôs also the most expensive.  Hospitals shouldn‚Äôt charge $8.00 for an aspirin or cotton ball.  The doctors should be the highest paid people in healthcare, not the executives.  No more drug ads, spend that money developing new drugs to charge a shitload for.  

5.  Carbon tax maybe?  I don‚Äôt know about this one, but something has to be done to incentivize moving away from fossil fuels.  Oil companies should have to invest a portion of their net profits into R&amp;D for renewables. (Why they aren‚Äôt anyway kind of boggles my mind, even spending 25% is like $4b/yr for Exxon.)  Not a fan of forcing this stuff but no one in power are really doing it on their own.  

Obviously these are all pipe dreams, like a perfect communist utopia or a perfect free market.  The problem is that big companies and governments get to a certain point where they aren‚Äôt accountable to the people they are supposed to be working for.  I don‚Äôt know how we fix that.  

Sorry for the novel, clearly I‚Äôm avoiding cleaning my house.  "
4843,"I'd imagine that the Great Lakes would end up somewhat like the English Channel during WW2. Lots of mines throughout the area, with smaller craft and submarines doing recon patrols against enemy shipping and fortifications. Commercial shipping would be extremely limited or nonexistent, especially closer to the border between these two groups. The actual coastline would probably end up like the Atlantic Wall; heavily fortified, with more minefields, bunker systems, and military garrisons all around the region. Intelligence agencies, resistance groups, and refugees could possibly try to use the lakes to move around the border undetected, but it would still be risky.

Looking at the border in your map, it seems like most of these preparations would take place around Lake Superior. There could be some minor fortifications and defenses in Lake Michigan and Lake Huron, but they probably wouldn't be as extensive. Lake Erie and Lake Ontario would be relatively untouched, although they might act as staging grounds for the Kriegsmarine/East Canadian Navy. The US and Canadian Navies would be far more limited than the Germans in this scenario, especially since the Germans could send in further naval reinforcements from the Atlantic."
4844,"The flow over the falls is constantly eroding the bedrock at the base (and at the lip).  The Niagara Gorge, north from the falls to the mouth of Lake Ontario, is evidence of the falls slowly eroding its way south at a historical rate of about couple of inches per year (rates vary depending on the hardness and composition of the underlying bedrock).  The estimate is that the falls will continue retreating south -- somewhat slower now because water diversions for hydro power decrease the volume that goes over the falls, thus decreasing erosion -- eventually reaching the mouth of Lake Erie in about 100,000 years or so.  At that point, there won't be any falls anymore, just a very fast-moving flow out of Lake Erie into a very deep Niagara gorge.   "

Not, it's based on reality.

The auto industry, in its infancy, before environment regulations appeared used to dump raw sewage, paint, oil, car parts, etc into the rivers &amp; lakes around Detroit.

Factories, coal power plants, etc used to spew raw exhaust into the air. We had to pass environment regulations to cut down on the pollution that was going on in the U.S.

I'm 52, born in '66. I've seen significant environment cleanup thanks to the clear air and clear water acts during my lifetime. Rivers that you wouldn't stick a toe into are now swimmable. The CT river was a sewer when I was a kid. Thanks to the clean up, especially the river above the dam in Holyoke, MA is considerably cleaner. The Charles river and Boston harbor have seen significant improvements thanks to  the clear air &amp; water acts.

How are those toxic Lake Erie algae blooms that poisoned multiple city water systems to the point of shutdown and required your governor to declare a state of emergency doing? Magically gone forever, I take it?

Jokes aside: the Great Lakes are in *dire* danger from a dozen different completely avoidable manmade threats, and shallow Lake Erie is the canary in that particular coal mine, but that has nothing to do with the poisoning of Flint. 

Flint happened because of Republican legislators who successfully raped our state's democratic process and left it for dead (a calculated four-stage process that many here can recount), then proceeded to spend the rest of the decade assaulting us with as much cronyism and perversion of stewardship as they could inject into the bloated corpse of our representation."

4871,"Yes - or hopefully. One of the big issues in the Great Lakes right now is that Lake Erie specifically is highly eutrophic. The most recent largest algal bloom in history I believe was in ~~2014~~ [2013](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiTsaTNvNffAhUj4IMKHZ7cAnAQjRx6BAgBEAU&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fearth.esa.int%2Fweb%2Fearth-watching%2Fenvironmental-hazards%2Fcontent%2F-%2Farticle%2Falgal-blooms-in-lake-erie-north-america-&amp;psig=AOvVaw1PXOPMPH200wYYvqOontrE&amp;ust=1546806287245982). We've made great strides in reducing run-off and preventing further nutrient loading, but a huge issue is the legacy of previous phosphorous influxes. Phosphorous very rapidly precipitates into the sediment, where if conditions are good it will stay there unused. However, it can also act as a source to reintroduce phosphorous back into the water column and feed algal blooms if the benthos of the lake becomes anoxic. 

The question isn't so much ""can nature correct itself"" but ""*how long* will nature take to correct itself"". Given time an ecosystem may revert back to baseline levels, or may equilibrate to form an entirely different type of ecosystem, though it may not benefit us. As long as we continue to interact with and pollute water sources, the ecological state of the lake will remain unbalanced. 

To put into perspective the issues we deal with in environmental science and the time it takes to see the effects of positive change, let me give an example: 

Ground water contamination is becoming a larger issue. Pollutants from the surface percolate through the soil and bedrock into aquifers where the water is stored. If an aquifer has a 60 year residence time (the amount of time it takes for water to move into and out of the aquifer), then detection of pollutants in an aquifer are from pollutants spilled decades in the past. If we say ""we want to reduce pollutants in the aquifer to a safe level by reducing surface pollution by 50%"", we must keep in mind that there are 60 years worth of pollutants which went undetected that are still percolating and infiltrating the aquifer. We may not see any benefit of our work or reductions for decades. 

Environmental science can be woefully unsatisfying. Depending on your field, you may never see the benefit of your work. But thats why its so important to do - because the longer we hold off on addressing environmental concerns, the further into the future the problem will stretch. "
4872,"As far as working in the long run, since the clean water act was beefed up we haven‚Äôt had any rivers regularly catching fire, so that‚Äôs a major accomplishment. We‚Äôve also been able to reverse ozone depletion and reduce acid rain, to name a couple. I know that you certainly couldn‚Äôt swim in the river than runs through my region in the 70s and 80s, and you now can thanks to the TMDL plans and point source regulations implemented under the EPA‚Äôs decentralized structure. 

For people not knowing whether something is harming them and where that harm is coming from, they honestly often don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible, nor something we would want, for every single person to be solely responsible for understanding how they are being impacted in every single way imaginable. That‚Äôs the beauty of things like academic expertise, investigative journalism and, well, informed inquiry and investigations in general. They allow experts in the field to dig into issues that would fly over a layman‚Äôs head to get to the root cause and the related impacts. 

Also, your highlighting of someone deciding to or not to hire a lawyer is a perfect example of how less oversight leads to disproportionate harm to those who aren‚Äôt already extremely well off. When we‚Äôve got, what, 70 percent or more of Americans living paycheck to paycheck you can bet that spending money to MAYBE get some financial restitutions isn‚Äôt a risk they‚Äôre going to be willing or even financially able to look into, let alone take. That leads to the poor getting fucked (which, relatedly, the whole field of environmental justice revolves around).

As far as I understand, these general ideas can all be applied to consumer, medical, and financial protection as well.

""A major source of impairment is thought to be historic wastewater effluent leaching from impoundments associated with the wastewater treatment plant adjacent to Granite Creek, occurring for decades prior to the mid-1980s. The impoundments were reconstructed and lined, and a pipeline was built to route effluent around the lake to recharge basins near the Prescott Airport. While this source no longer exists, it is expected that nutrients from this historic loading have accumulated in lake sediments. Additional sources of impairment include urban stormwater runoff influenced by fertilizer use, atmospheric deposition, domestic animal waste, streambank erosion, and other non-point nutrient sources. Existing wastewater related sources include septic leach fields, sanitary sewer system leaks, and package treatment plants. Historic dumping and landfills are also a concern""

[What are impaired waters?](https://deq.nc.gov/about/divisions/water-resources/planning/modeling-assessment/water-quality-data-assessment#Impaired)

&gt;Impaired waters are a subset of the assessments made where water quality samples for a particular parameter on a waterbody exceed water quality standards and the assessment methodology has determined that the waterbody is indeed impaired for the particular parameter. Impaired waters are grouped into two categories:

    Category 4 assessments are those that do not need a TMDL. These are not included in the 303(d) list.
    Category 5 assessments are those that require a TMDL or TMDL alternative. These Category 5 waters are assembled in a single document (the 303(d) list) and sent to EPA on April 1st of every even-numbered year, per 40 CFR 130.7. EPA must approve, disapprove, or partially approve each 303(d) list. 303(d) files can be found here.

But on the whole, I believe the rise of the Evangelical right and their fixation on abortion and race would make the hard right of Gingrich inevitable. Just as Obama was the nadir of the tea party racism, we would have had earlier catalysts, earlier moments, when the racism of the deep south would rebel and form around a different nexus.

I'm afraid that our inability to deal with the south and the legacy/causes of the civil war has doomed our politics for some time. And it will continue to do so. 

This article highlights how the we created a system that used that racism and created the fear (they're closing my factory!) to leverage the scales in their favor, to maintain that leverage, to even co-opt the democratic party to advance their goals. 

But in conclusion I can't see how the right wouldn't ascend as they did. From televangelists and get-rich-quick schemes to the soft racism, the populace was primed for simple answers to complex issues. It's just that they are all terrible and poor answers."

4901,"This is just wrong. 

I live less than a mile from the Great Lakes. Have lived here my whole life. 

The reality is, yes American companies have polluted heavily into the Great Lakes but so has Canada.

First off, it would be impossible for Canada to not have polluted.

Boating is a major thing in the Great Lakes. When my parents were growing up they would take a ferry to Crystal Beach, Canada. Major destination for both countries and it featured an amusement park.

Secondly, the US built the Erie Canal that ran from right into Lake Erie around Buffalo to the Manhattan River right above Albany. This cut major transportation costs around the board. Before this, the only way to get to NYC by boat was to take the St. Lawrence river from Lake Ontario or more upstream all the way towards Newfoundland and then thru the Atlantic to NYC.

Are you insinuating that Canada was ahead of the game and knew pollution was very bad and they were eco-friendly all the way before the Erie Canal in the 1840s? Because it was in the 60s, 70s, and 80s were people finally starting to wake up to the issues.

Let's also talk about how big of an impact the Erie Canal did, to stress that Canada would be missing out on a lot.

Feeding into Lake Erie in Buffalo is also the Buffalo River. The Buffalo River is lined with grain-elevators and it's only a mile upstream that you're in the lake. There's tons of them there, and there's plenty in Cleveland, etc. And if you Google it, there's plenty in Canada too. 

Yeah, no. Canada polluted. We did too. Let's stop doing the blame game and start caring for nature."

At least 13 fires have been reported on the Cuyahoga River, the first occurring in 1868.[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuyahoga_River#cite_note-adler-15) The largest river fire in 1952 caused over $1 million in damage to boats, a bridge, and a riverfront office building

&amp;#x200B;

The Cuyahoga River, at times during the 20th century, was one of the most [polluted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_pollution) rivers in the United States. The [reach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reach_(geography)) from Akron to Cleveland was devoid of fish. A 1968 [Kent State University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_State_University) symposium described one section of the river:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;From 1,000 feet \[300¬†m\] below Lower Harvard Bridge to Newburgh and South Shore Railroad Bridge, the channel becomes wider and deeper and the level is controlled by Lake Erie. Downstream of the railroad bridge to the harbor, the depth is held constant by dredging, and the width is maintained by piling along both banks. **The surface is covered with the brown oily film observed upstream as far as the Southerly Plant effluent. In addition, large quantities of black heavy oil floating in slicks, sometimes several inches thick, are observed frequently. Debris and trash are commonly caught up in these slicks forming an unsightly floating mess. Anaerobic action is common as the dissolved oxygen is seldom above a fraction of a part per million. The discharge of cooling water increases the temperature by 10 to 15¬†¬∞F \[5.6 to 8.3¬†¬∞C\]. The velocity is negligible, and sludge accumulates on the bottom. Animal life does not exist.** Only the algae [*Oscillatoria*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscillatoria) grows along the piers above the water line. The color changes from gray-brown to rusty brown as the river proceeds downstream. Transparency is less than 0.5 feet \[0.15¬†m\] in this reach. **This entire reach is grossly polluted**.[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuyahoga_River#cite_note-14)

The answer is yes, although you usually have things on poles so you don't usually have to get on the roof.  You do it from the ground, and I've even done it through a window on the second floor. 

99% of the time if you have an ice storm, it's because the temparature is hovering just above/below freezing when the storm happens.  Below freezing, you get snow.  Just at the freezing mark or above, you get ice storms, sleet, etc.

So if you are lucky, the temp is at least a teeny bit above freezing the next day when you are dealing with the aftermath.  If you are unlucky, the wet snow/sleet/ice gets covered in 6 inches of snow and you are just kinda fucked.

That said, this isn't all of Ohio, just the people on the NE side of Lake Erie.  The lake is so large and deep it creates it's own weather patterns.  I grew up an hour south of it - and the weather there is far less evil.

4935,"It's also cause for this unfortunately too:

&gt;Lake Erie is also shallow in comparison to the other Great Lakes, NRDC‚Äôs Hobbs said, and that makes it more likely that bacteria-laden sediment will be picked up by currents and re-suspended in the water. Shallow water is also warmer and more hospitable to bacteria.

https://articles.cleveland.com/healthfit/index.ssf/2013/07/ohios_lake_erie_beaches_worst.amp

4936,"Idk, it‚Äôs not entirely bad that it‚Äôs shallow. I was so bitter my first summer in Chicago, cuz I spent the whole summer waiting for the water to warm up until I finally realized it never would because of how much deeper it is than Lake Erie. "
4937,"Right, I was not trying to say that all algae are harmless, just that the earthy/musty taste that lots of places experience in the summer is not itself a health concern. A lot of harmful contaminants are tasteless and odorless, so taste is not always a reliable way of gauging water safety. 

With algal toxins, it's complicated. Depends a lot on the type of algae that grow in a particular place because again, some are harmless. Warmer temperatures and lower water levels caused by climate change will likely increase the amount of algae in slow-moving bodies of water like lakes and reservoirs. Not really a quick and easy solution to this. However, nutrient pollution is one aspect that is often overlooked, and in terms of fast, cost-effective solutions, there is quite a bit of low hanging fruit. For example, Lake Erie (source of the 2014 Toledo outbreak) is severely polluted with agricultural runoff. Stream-bank restoration, improved fertilizer application practices, and (the unpopular) reduction in livestock farming are all guaranteed ways of  reducing nutrient pollution that feasible, under human control, and guaranteed to have positive results. But you don't see it happening because it all costs money and humans are notoriously bad at delayed gratification, especially when the gratification is ""diluted"" among many individuals.

So where am I going with all of this? I don't know, except to say that as someone who works in water quality, it is more nuanced than the average person thinks. There are also lots of known solutions for water quality problems, but they aren't implemented because they are expensive or unpopular."
4938,"Yeah! A lot of the water that flows through niagara falls provides clean water &amp; power for NYC, unfortunately.

4955,"I agree, but it isn't ideal unless the city also has a transportation system in place for seniors and people who are house bound. I know it sounds a little ridiculous to expect the city to Also provide that, but there have been times our power has gone out and while we do have public transit that is free to any warming centers if you ask, at the same time we don't live on a main street. With the way the snow gets out here (we live by Lake Erie), and because we don't typically get plowed at a normal hour, my senior mother has problems leaving the house with us. At times my husband or I will take our 20 month old and rush to a warming station while the other one stays behind with her....But then our child, who has a few learning disabilities, wants us both and is an absolute terror to the parent who has him.

It's horrible, and it's like....My mother isn't severely disabled, but she has a hard time walking in the snow and ice. We can't afford a wheelchair or scooter, and her insurance will only cover 10% of it. Further more, we don't even have emergency animal shelters in our area, and while my mother has papers for her dog so he can come with, the two cats we have are just cats and wind up stuck.

It's a frustrating situation all the way around. We've even attempted to shovel out a path all the way down our street for her, but my husband has scoliosis and I have chronic anemia, so we can't get very far.

I wouldn't expect an electrical worker to risk their lives, but I still wish that cities had better plans in place to help those who can't always help themselves. Emergencies happen....we could prepare better."
4956,"The Great Lakes Region isn't affected?  Dude.  Lake Erie is a Petri dish thanks to fertilizer run off.  Ohio has closed beaches along Erie and OEPA has declared Grand Lake St. Marys is dying from deoxygenation.

Tropical storms are now capable of reaching up to Cincinnati by coming up the Mississippi Valley. In the first three months of 2015 Ohio lost 48% of its honeybee colonies.

You gotta be living in Michigan."

4966,This has been my point for years now.  Everyone seems so invested in one particular type.  If it were me and I was creating a plan to cut emissions i would have a stated country goal to cut emissions and each state would need to cut a certain percent based on their contribution.  The state level could come up with what it deems would be most effecient and submit it proposal to the fed.  My biggest concern is solar is completely viable in California especially in conjunction with hydro however solar isnt particularly viable in Ohio and neither is hydro in certain areas.  River cities and the lake erie cities could use hydro but i dont think the columbus could benefit much from hydro.  If you get into eastern ohio you would probably be looking at nuclear and solar or wind.  It cant just be all in on 1 and the fed wont be able to determine what is best for each locale in each state.

The attempt was going to set a Guinness World Record and raise moral for a city often referred to as ‚Äúthe mistake on the lake.‚Äù

The event was a disaster, achieving none of its goals, polluted nearby Lake Erie with 300,000 balloons, didn‚Äôt get a world record, and may have contributed to two people dying.

4968,"As other have said, the temp bouncing above and below freezing so often is a huge factor.

Also large trucks.  Ohio is a huge logistics state because it's so close (a day or so drive) to a huge portion of the US population.  Plus direct access to lake Erie and the Ohio River (which leads to the Mississippi).

So we have a lot more heavy truck traffic than other states do too.

Also, when we say that it bounces above and below freezing a lot.  We mean like, everyday.  Not once or twice a week."

4971,"Why aren‚Äôt we planting food we can actually eat? Like greens, peppers and tomatoes, potatoes, onions, etc. 

Edit: this was sarcasm. I know why. It‚Äôs because it‚Äôs subsidized as hell and there‚Äôs a market for it. It makes farmers think they are feeding the world, when are they are doing is fattening (and destroying) the world. Soy is so processed, in so many ways, that it doesn‚Äôt show up as soy or canola on your ingredients list on the back of your boxes of food, even if it‚Äôs in there.

We should be producing and eating foods that can be produced and eaten locally, reducing transportation costs, with no to minimal processing. This is how we are going to not destroy our earth. Because soy is definitely part of the destruction of humankind. Pesticide, nutrient, sediment, and stormwater runoff from monocultural ag fields are why all of our waterbodies are eroding, polluted, and toxic. The Ohio River (most polluted river in North America) and Lake Erie both get massive toxic algal blooms caused be unregulated agricultural runoff. Our forms and style of agriculture need to change in order for us to survive. We cannot and are not not saving the world with GMO corn and canola. "
4972,"At one point, I lived within visual distance of the Davis-Besse plant on lake Erie. At that time, they discovered a persistent leak of borated water had eaten a football sized hole in the reactor head, leaving 3/8"" of steel holding back the high pressure irradiated coolant. Failure would have led to emergency reactor shut down, but the response inspection discovered other safety issues that could have escalated the situation. This corporate-owned plant has had other issues like a tritium leak and safety procedure violations and the corporation has seen decent fines for them.

4973,"Large scale monocultural crops are:
- sprayed with fungicide, killing all biology in the soil, 

- sprayed with herbicide, killing some but not all ‚Äúweeds‚Äù (and in the process, both killing neighboring not organic crops with drifting bad applications and creating ‚Äúsuper weeds‚Äù - invasive species that are adapting and becoming immune to herbicides),

- creating so much stormwater runoff that basically all streams in the state of Ohio have seriously eroding banks and many are downcutting (stream morphology characteristics of streams that are unstable and actively changing because of current and recent impacts). This causes extreme amounts of sediment in water. The sediment itself kills and prevents reestablishment of fish, macroinvertebrates, mussels, etc that require cleaner water. The sediment also darkens water and this raises temperatures, which further kills and prevents reestablishment of sensitive native aquatic species, and this thus impacts all species that rely on those other species for food, shelter, etc.

- washes so much sediment off of fields that it causes all of the above ecological issues, compounding those issues.

- so much nutrient loads are washing off of gear fields that we have had toxic algal blooms on both Lake Erie and the Ohio River at the same time, causing Toledo and many smaller municipalities to be unable to get water from their water sources. Toledoans could not drink their water for a week. Or bathe in it. Or really, should not have, but probably did.

- the monocultural provide zero habitat value, minimal and bad food value to pollinators (birds, bees, moths, wasps, bats, etc) and these monocultures are not the diets they naturally would eat and often become sources of unhealthy food for pollinators. And because monocultures all bloom at the same time, food is only available in that area during a short window of time all year long, so it‚Äôs a terrible source of food and impacts pollinators in those ways.

- pollinators often will get sprayed or eat from flowering plants recently sprayed with herbicides that are often toxic to them, killing them.

- often monocultural crops are grown solely to be eaten by cattle or other livestock, which are also most often rested in situations that cause equally serious ecological damage, including tons of point source and non point source nutrient loading and pollution, stormwater runoff, and the reliance upon the entire row crop industry to feed it. The amount of CO2 and methane emissions, not only from farm equipment and cowfarts, but transportation of these animals and their dead animal parts also need to be taken into consideration.


Monocultural row crops are the centerpiece of a system of ‚Äúfood production‚Äù, which should also be called a system of governmentally accepted ecological genocide.

4975,"Plus, it fails to account the potential economic boom associated with a cleaner environment. In the 1970s, Lake Erie was called a ""dead Lake"" due to pollution (The river flowing through Cleveland caught on fire...a bunch.

4976,"Yep. It‚Äôs fucking gross. My boyfriend and I went to college in Fredonia and our favorite thing to do in the area was go to the lake. Lake Erie is so beautiful down there. The trash though absolutely fucking disgusting. I know all beaches get trashed, but I was also truly shocked at the amount. It‚Äôs unbelievable what people will just throw in the lake or leave on the beach.

On Earth Day one year we spent the day at a less-accessible beach in Dunkirk, we picked up like 10+ bags of trash in 2 hours. I don‚Äôt understand how people could experience the beauty of Lake Erie and then feel like it‚Äôs okay to throw their trash in/on it. "
4977,"It's an idea that could be done in/ around Cleveland. Once the lake gets warm the Lake Erie Islands have days where scuba divers clean up water around the islands, could organize something like that in safe water areas around the city as a trashtag.

4979,"I haven't heard that they are healthier... but now that you say that, considering the industry that is on the American shore with the Detroit and Maumee rivers dumping into the western basin, and they Cuyahoga river dumping into the central basin, I'd imagine there are more pollutants built up in the sediment on this half of the lake.  Just a guess.

&amp;#x200B;

But to address the ""able to be fished"", the US has significantly more strict fishing regulations than they have in Canada.  Regulations have crippled the American fishing industry on Lake Erie, there are only a handful of commercial fishing companies on this side of the lake."

They don't need to rely on groundwater which is usually where you find contamination, especially in old industrial areas. 

Also like u/bctg106 said the problem flint wasn't so much the water source but the old lead pipes, which also aren't normally a problem because the pipes naturally built up a layer of oxidized metal or something that keeps the lead from leeching into the water. This is from memory so I might be a little off on the facts but I'm pretty sure what happened in flint was they switched to ground water which meant they had to use harsher chemicals to make it safe compared to the lake water from detroit. The chemicals corroded the pipes, so the barrier that kept the lead from getting into the water wore off. "

4991,"&gt;Conservatives have spun this up into a full invasion of federal bureaucrats. Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell says they‚Äôll be nosing around your home and business, ‚Äúforcing you to pay for costly updates.‚Äù New York Times columnist David Brooks cites the section on buildings as one way the Green New Deal (a ‚Äúfantasy,‚Äù he calls it) would centralize ‚Äúpower in the hands of the Washington elite.‚Äù Scary!

&gt;The irony is that among climate policy wonks, the call to reduce building emissions is one of the more banal elements of the resolution. Anyone who has studied the problem of reducing US greenhouse gas emissions to net zero ‚Äî ‚Äúdeep decarbonization,‚Äù in the lingo ‚Äî knows that buildings are a top agenda item.

&gt;The reason is simple: Buildings are responsible for about 40 percent of the greenhouse gases in the US. Those emissions come, in part, from the fossil fuels (primarily natural gas these days but also heating oil) burned to heat (and cool) the water and space inside buildings.

&gt;That means the solution, alongside reducing and eliminating emissions from the electricity sector, is getting all those heating and cooling systems replaced by systems that are hooked up to the grid. In other words: electrification. (Electrify everything!) Happily for nervous conservatives, most of this work will be done by the private sector, guided by public regulation, so your home will not be invaded by jackbooted efficiency thugs.

The problem I have with this framing is that once the conservatives catch on that their current talking point isn't working, they're gonna pivot to the ""but muh private sector, but muh free market.""

Free market philosophy doesn't work without the implicit federal threat... ie exactly the ""jackbooted efficiency thugs"" you're making a throwaway joke about.

This is the prime reason they've been talking about and succeding at cutting EPA regulations: to get rid of the governmental threat... to remove the ability of the feds to regulate private businesses.

We need these regulations in place or else we go back to having our rivers LITERALLY ON FIRE.

The river is famous for having been so polluted that it ""caught fire"" in 1969. The event helped to spur the environmental movement in the US."
4992,"Not sure I agree. Will there be difficulties as these ""human"" rights are granted to non-humans and lawsuits are brought? Of course. Is there a better option? Possibly.

But right now, this is a way to protect places that should be protected. Lake Erie was just granted personhood by the residents of Toledo, OH. Every summer, toxic algae blooms ruin drinking water, hurt tourism, and obviously harm wildlife in the lake. To prevent it, you'd have to legislate the farms who's pollution runoff causes the blooms. Big ag is a huge industry, with enormous lobbying power. That would be a monumental fight. But by changing their strategy, conservationists got citizens to agree to protect the lake by giving it legal standing. 

Long story short, if this is working for now, roll with it. The alternative is nothing is protected and ends up being destroyed."

&gt; Great Lakes water levels will be higher than normal, and some may approach record levels, for the summer boating season, according to the latest forecast of Great Lakes water levels issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

&gt; Lake Superior is already near record high levels and by May could reach a record that was set in the mid-1980s, according to a six-month forecast.

&gt; Lake Erie could reach record highs in late spring as well.

Superior is also supposed to be really nice.  Don't really know much about huron or ontario to comment on them.

I seem to recall something about the lakes being full of untreated urban sewage.  I guess that's one of the problems in the historic rust-belt.  Most of the cities were developed prior to physical separations between storm- and sanitary- sewers.

Under ***climate change*** with high amounts of rain falling in short periods of time, 500-year events are happening on the regular.  There's no place to store that rain run-off, so they simply send the shit right into the lakes.  They are allowed to.

The last great lakes city that I lived in was discharging untreated shit into Lake Erie about 200 days a year.  Oopsy.  The engineering around the sewer pipes simply isn't correctly calibrated to the amount of rain the great lakes is getting under the new climate regime.

There are 151 towns just on the USA side of the border with combined sewage systems that are discharging into the lakes.  Little towns you might have heard of, like: Chicago (85% untreated), Dearborn, Toledo, Detroit, Buffalo, Rochester etc.  Read a little more [here](https://www.epa.gov/npdes/combined-sewer-overflows-great-lakes-basin)."

Since the industrial revolution, we have dumped about 585 billion tons of CO2 into the atmosphere. That 585,000,000,000 ***tonnes***. A quick conversion shows us that a cubic mile of water weighs approximately 4.1 billion tons. If we were to concentrate all of the CO2 to equate to the same weight per cubic mile, we will have filled up and overflowed the entirety of lake Erie.

But with climate change and our environmental degredation I wish we could put legal policy around protecting wetlands and riparian zones since these are our most endangered habitats. But how do you tell a farmer he can no longer farm those acres abutting a small creek? The farmer behind my place bulldozed a forest along a creek a couple years ago and the erosion since has removed almost a foot of soil along the drainage. Not to mention farmers along lake eries bluffs farm right up to the edge of the cliffs.

5038,"Yes! Except I think you typoed...Erie is 210 feet at its deepest, but it is exceptionally shallow in its Western Basin (roughly up to Sandusky/Pelee). This part of the lake warms up much faster in summer and therefore is more susceptible to toxic algal blooms (also the mouth of largest tributary to the Great Lakes, the Maumee River, is on this part of the lake‚Äîwhich drains large swaths of farmland). Lake Erie can also be very moody as well‚Äîit can be perfectly calm and sunny, and an hour later there can be a storm with whitecaps and waves big enough to sink a small craft."

This references the lake as being about half a mile in diameter. That‚Äôs pretty small, although it is a deep lake (no source just assuming based off the movie). Since they allow swimming in the lake it would have a beneficial use designation (or U.K. equivalent, I really only know about U.S. water law) as a recreational body of water, which holds some of the strictest standards for pollutant levels. If 1000 students plus professors and other staff are all depositing raw sewage directly into the lake every day (and have been for 1100 years) with no sophisticated treatment system I have no doubt whatsoever that that lake would be violating all acceptable organic pollutant levels (it would probably even be physically apparent that the lake is polluted).

With a load of iron ore twenty-six thousand tons more
Than the Edmund Fitzgerald weighed empty
That good ship and crew was a bone to be chewed
When the gales of November came early
The ship was the pride of the American side
Coming back from some mill in Wisconsin
As the big freighters go, it was bigger than most
With a crew and good captain well seasoned
Concluding some terms with a couple of steel firms
When they left fully loaded for Cleveland
And later that night when the ship's bell rang
Could it be the north wind they'd been feelin'?
The wind in the wires made a tattle-tale sound
And a wave broke over the railing
And every man knew, as the captain did too,
T'was the witch of November come stealin'
The dawn came late and the breakfast had to wait
When the gales of November came slashin'
When afternoon came it was freezin' rain

If they'd put fifteen more miles behind her
They might have split up or they might have capsized
They may have broke deep and took water

In the maritime sailors' cathedral

5044,Depends on the beach. In southern Ontario you basically have lake Huron that is nice and clean then you have lake Erie that is nasty. Go further north to Georgian Bay and the water is super clean and fresh.
5045,"On the Great Lakes the waves are large enough to sink commercial SHIPS let along small pleasure boats people like to drive around for fun.   

I live along Lake Erie, the smaller of the lakes, and rescue services are always pretty active whenever a large storm rolls though as somebody ends up with their yaht or speed boat sunk in the waves.  And there is a pretty substantial death toll as a result.  

Also because its small sea, conditions can change *rapidly* when an inland thunderstorm supercell moves out over the warm summer water and quickly gains strength.  One can go from calm waters to 10 foot+ waves in a little as 10 minutes.   

That and Ohio is the eastern end of ""tornado alley"" so a tornado spawning supercells end up over the lake often enough meaning waterspouts are very much a thing.  

Also...Lake erie sucks and is not worth visiting because my town of Toledo Ohio dumps raw sewage into the lake when we get torrential rains because Toledo has a woefully inadequate sewer treatment system AND 19th century combined storm drains/sewer pipes.  There were levies put up to get things modernized and the public here voted them down.  So don't expect that to change anytime soon.  Then we factor in the agricultural runoff from the Entire Maumee River watershed, and Detroit river and its watershed...and well we have a HUUUUUUUUUUGE toxic alge bloom problem.  

And and the Canadians dammed the river to Lake Ottawa, raising Like Erie several meters over its historical level...so all the sandy beaches that used to be tourist hotspots are all underwater, and now they smell like fish market on a hot day.  And its all lake water crashing on ""sea walls"" anymore.  There is also some geologic stuff, as the aera is slowly sinking over time.  Like a portion of Toledo called Point Place is probably going to be under water by 2100.  "

Lake Erie even today is pretty bad compared to the other Great Lakes. It's the shallowest of the bunch, which leads to it having a higher concentration of fertilizer runoff and other pollutants than the other Lakes."

I remember as a kid in the 90s we weren't supposed to eat fish out of Lake Erie because of the high level of mercury and other pollutants.  The [Intercept article](https://theintercept.com/2018/12/07/epas-new-water-rule-will-gut-the-clean-water-act/) that the OP article cribs from addresses the 1969 Cuyahoga River fire specifically, and also points out that 98% of the Great Lakes' 4460 miles of monitored shoreline is contaminated.

I know that Republicans hate regulation, especially environmental regulation, but there is a reason why its needed...as identified by a fucking river catching fire in the 1970s because of how polluted it is.  The free market will not take care of issues like environmental pollution, because we as consumers will always go for the cheapest product, and if that product was obtained through ransacking our environment, it will be done.  If it weren't for environmental regulations and enforcement of said regulations, the Great Lakes would be industrial waste pools by now."
5053,"Thats not the main benefit of it.  Processed foods keep longer and can actually be shipped around the globe to feed people.  Organic, healthy will not.  Can we afford to feed the world? Enough of it sure.  Its more of a logistical problem.  Many of the countries we would do that for dont have the agricultural capability due to climate or corrupt governments that poorly run the economy and waste resources.  Some of these countries have soil or water quality issues that make it unsafe to consume produced from those sources.  Somalia for example cannot fish their waters due to the amount of nuclear waste that was dumped during soviet times.  Hell, in Lake Erie the DEC suggests you only eat one white fish out of the lake per year because of the amount of mercury and other contaminants in the water.  Its simply safer to provide processed genetically modified food than what the countries can produce themselves."
5054,"I'm from Northeast Ohio, so believe me, I know all about agricultural runoff. It's a massive problem for Lake Erie.

My only point is that organic farming is not really a solution to that problem, in large part because year it arbitrarily procludes the use of ""unnatural"" chemicals, even when they're less harmful to health and/or the environment than natural ones. Organic farming often leads to increased use of herbicides and pesticides, and the use of ones that can more harmful to the environment than conventional alternatives.

If you grow your own food, that's great. But on the global scale, the most environmentally sustainable way of feeding everybody is to use the best parts of organic and conventional agriculture together."

5058,"Environmental scientist for a Florida municipality here. From what I gather from your question you are concerned about beach closures due to high bacterial concentrations. 

Part of the state and federal environmental agencies‚Äô duties is to ensure the safety of the natural water bodies by reducing pollutant loading from point sources (sewage discharge) and non point sources (storm water or anything without a traceable origin).

The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) was devised by the EPA to reduce pollution loading to water bodies. The environmental agencies regularly monitor water bodies for the core water quality metrics to determine if they are impaired. These metrics include nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus, chlorophyll (algae), and bacterial concentrations to name a few. Once a waterbody is deemed impaired for a long enough period of time, a TMDL or total maximum daily load will be drafted. TMDLs mark a specific pollutant reduction goal to be met by the city, county, and/or state for that waterbody. Often this includes BMAPs or basin management action plans that highlight specific methods and practices that should be used to reduce pollutant loading.

If the routine monitoring caught high microbial concentrations for a coastal area they may have ordered a QMRA or quantitative microbial risk assessment to determine if the presence of bacteria such as E. coli are high enough to pose a public health risk. If the risk is great then they‚Äôll shut down a beach.

Sorry if this is long winded, but it can be complicated even for me and I deal with this type of stuff on a regular basis. Let me know if you have more questions and I‚Äôll do my best to answer them.

5059,"[Nat Geo takes a climate change angle but still points out fertalizer and septic tank runoff are the main culprits leading to the algae blooms](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/08/140804-harmful-algal-bloom-lake-erie-climate-change-science/)

[NYT says: City officials said that a harmful algae bloom in Lake Erie likely contaminated the water. The blooms are often caused by runoff from overfertilized fields, malfunctioning septic systems or livestock pens, the notice said.](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/04/us/toledo-faces-second-day-of-water-ban.html)

[Eco Watch says: ""Commonplace in Lake Erie in the 1960s, toxic algal blooms disappeared from the lake following international, national and state efforts to reduce the phosphorus pollution that drives them. The federal Clean Water Act of 1972 was especially important for reducing phosphorus from city sewage plants and other ‚Äúpoint"" sources that discharged pollutants from a pipe. The CWA, however, did little to address phosphorus runoff from farms and lawns, known as ‚Äúnonpoint"" sources. Researchers have shown that a rise in phosphorus levels‚Äîparticularly a form of the nutrient that is readily available to promote algae growth‚Äîhas coincided with renewed blooms in Lake Erie, and international agencies have called for a reduction in phosphorus to alleviate problematic blooms in Lake Erie and elsewhere in the Great Lakes. The largest bloom ever recorded on the lake occurred in 2011. Scientists and environmental groups say addressing agriculture is particularly important for reducing the blooms.""](https://www.ecowatch.com/toxic-algae-bloom-leaves-500-000-without-drinking-water-in-ohio-1881940537.html)

And lets not forget, the entire reason for this bill is to help protect Lake Erie, something Columbus doesn't benefit from at all. 

But one of the biggest reason why the state is going to put public money into all stadiums that ask for it, is because if a team is using a taxpayer funded stadium, the Modell Law applies to them and they can't just up and move.

I totally understand that people think their taxes aren't being spent correctly, but your anger is misplaced. 

If you want to get REALLY mad about the state wasting your money, look into Bill Lager, the ECOT scandal, and into private charter schools (Also dubbed Chartergate).

5081,"There‚Äôs a sinister historical note in that old phrase ‚Äúdrain the swamp‚Äù. While it‚Äôs now a political phrase, it originated as a literal phrase, because that‚Äôs exactly what we would do everywhere we settled. Swamps, fens, bogs, marshes and all manner of wetland habitat were considered ‚Äòjunk land‚Äô that would be better turned into farmland if possible. In the 1800‚Äôs, swamp airs were even thought to bring disease, which was utter superstition (swamps actually smell really good unless you dig into the muck, and are quite healthy to be near). And so we drained every last square inch possible.

I heavily sympathize with your everglades situation. there was a ton of swamp drained in southern Ontario - a very different kind of swamp, but wetland all the same. Drainage tiles were laid under virtually every farm field in southwestern ontario, and that area is virtually all farmland now, with areas like Chatham ballparking *less than 4% tree cover*. We took a landscape with lots of surface water and did away with it for human reasons. Southwest of Lake Erie in the states, there used to be a swamp *the size of a state*, now long gone and covered with farm fields. One of our largest and most impressive wetlands in my area of Ontario- the Minesing Wetland Complex - only exists because it was physically impossible to drain due to size and topography, and because of that it has some of our only 200+ year old trees. That‚Äôs what it took to keep us away - do the remaining everglades only remain for similar reasons?

In any case, we really do take a beating to the landscape, even with its human benefits. Fresh Water will be a *monumental* issue under climate change, and given how wetlands function to retain and filter water, we will probably wish we had more available."

It was a funeral for democracy over an issue where there was no public consultation just an announcement of a coal fired generation station in prime farmland along Lake Erie. An obvious environmental issue.  

Thankfully no one accused us of threatening death.  

Pols were a little brighter but no less mean!"
5102,"&gt; The problem is that people are choosing to be evil. And they do so because they have nothing to live for. Because we've destroyed the family.

People were not any less evil when the family was more valued in society. Again, the 50s and 60s saw unjust coups against governments with popular support and pollution so bad that lake erie was fucking set on fire. 

&gt; You don't understand that point. It goes over your head and you talk about your stupid leftist ideologies which are all short sighted but would require far more time than I have to get into.

I‚Äôm proving legitimate solutions to the collapse of society.

You are the one making strawmen argument and putting words into my mouth. 

&gt; No, it is not meat consumption. Even if we never wasted a grain of  rice the world would still be just as horrible because what will protect humanity from self-destruction is not efficient consumption. There is no way to control the population so well that you hover perfectly at food capacity. When there is capacity populations will grow until there is not enough capacity and it will contract. The goal is to try to calm the pendulum so it doesn't swing to such extremes... but you can't stop it.

Stopping meat consumption wouldn‚Äôt fix all the world‚Äôs problems. But it would be far from ‚Äújust as horrible‚Äù. Starvation rates would plummet. Deforestation for cropland wouldn‚Äôt be needed for decades. There‚Äôs no denying that this would at least help abate world issues.

&gt; I just don't see how a single thing you are saying is refuting the idea that birth control destroys the family structure which destroys society.

I addressed this a few comments back, and i‚Äôll address it again. Before mexican cartels change operations to produce birth control, the prohibition of BC would lead to an increase in teen pregnancy. The family structure you talk about is non existent in a family consisting of two 17 year olds and an unwanted baby. The family structure is strongest between two mature, financially stable people who actually intended to have said baby.

And as i‚Äôve said multiple times already, deviance from ‚Äútraditional family values‚Äù is not the root of the world‚Äôs problems, nor will it be the primary cause for the death of society."

I know this is satire, but good satire has a way of getting to the point.

I had a conversation with a conservative a couple months ago. Self declared ""very conservative"". He was pretty pissed about ""job crushing regulations"". So I asked him what regulations he was upset about. He pointed out the various environmental regulations that restrict farm operations. I pointed out various algae tides that have happened in Lake Erie, New Orleans, etc. etc. He didn't really accept the connection between runoff regulations, required green spaces, etc.

Then Florence and the FL red tides happened.

So yeah, the caricature isn't far off.

The GOP is the only political party *In The World* that denies climate change. They are the reason we don't have a single payer health care system.

I lived in a boat in high school on Lake Erie, and would often take the dingy around with my parents or go jet skiing with family friends. Well another couple my parents knew who lived in the marina invited me to go jet skiing with them.

We ended up putting around an abandoned marina called Turtle Cove? Turtle something? Well anyways we see a big plastic bag floating in the water and decide to go see what's in it. The wife grabbed a stick from the water and gives the bag a poke, but it moved very oddly. Like it's stuck, not floating. It eventually turns to the point where we can see a head under the water, along with legs and arms. I realized it was a naked girl, and her arms and legs had been hog tied behind her, and weighted by cement. The adults immediately called 911, police questioned us, then the adults me back ""home"" to the boat. It was kind of surreal tbh and I don't remember like.... Feeling too much if that makes sense.

What I really remember most is my parents talking a TON that year about how low the lake levels were. Barely any rain and the wind was always blowing it out. What they figure is that the killer thought the lake was a good place to dump bodies, but he must not have been from the area/not have been a boater or he would have been aware of the lake levels.

From what I remember, the body was one of two girls who had gone missing from a bar. I think it was a serial killer but I can't remember if he was caught.

5184,"It's the subsidiary of FirstEnergy that is bankrupt. The acquisition of Alleghany Energy forced them to take on a lot of debt and the acquisition came at a time when coal plants were becoming more costly to run compared to the newer natural gas facilities. FirstEnergy Solutions has liquidated a lot of their power generation assets through a number of coal plant closures along Lake Erie in Ohio, Hatfield's Ferry in Pennsylvania, and they almost had to close Pleasants in West Virginia. When you can't compete to natural gas plants and no one wants to buy them, you can't sell the remainder of your generation assets and they're worth nothing. They're stranded assets and the parent company takes a hit on their bottom line."
5185,"The bigger concern now, as you probably know, is the algae blooms we're seeing from farm runoff. Grand Lake St. Mary's was lousy with it, but luckily it's on the rebound. Now they have to figure out what they're going to do with Lake Erie."
5186,"Everything you‚Äôve said is spot on.

I‚Äôm a transplant, so here‚Äôs my take on the friends thing- Cleveland has had a lot of hardships and has been kicked around a lot- subprime loans and the housing market, industry up and left, Lake Erie pollution, depopulation, World Series losses, the Browns in general.

People love this city and are incredibly loyal- its easy to see why! It‚Äôs beautiful, the buildings are cool as shit, there is a TON of history, great parks,  museums, pretty good transit for a city this size, and I honestly believe that Cleveland in the spring is the most beautiful. 

The intense loyalty can make people suspicious of outsiders because those people are just going to try to ‚Äúmake a quick buck‚Äù or use them (see housing market and loss of industry). Give it about 2 years and really REALLY try to put yourself out there and you will reap the benefits.  

Like I said before- Clevelanders are some of the most loyal people around."
5187,"I'm not suggesting they join us here. Just pointing out that they're a team that's largely defined by their tragedies than by their successes, just like us. They can be in the Factory of Sadness even if they're not Lake Erie Bros."
5188,"The lion has THREE heads: Bitcoin (Ocean), Ethereum (Rivers/lakes) and Tronix (home faucet). ""My water lives in every human"". Stop trying to add sugar and color and flavor to everything and just hydrate the world already. BSV could probably work, just like we can also turn Lake Erie into Mountain Dew, but if the only value is that we can SELL IT FOR USD to buy food, well, we are still failing and it's not worth the effort."
5189,I live in the states by good old Lake Erie and we have several invasive species to the water such as zebra mussels and the mean Asian carp. We also have non native cattail and common reed with several other invasive plant species. I‚Äôd chose one of those.
5190,"Niagara River runs from Lake Erie into Lake Ontario. Those coordinates are before the waterfall. There are little buoys that say to go no further, but there is nothing physically stopping you. 

Yes, if your engine dies out there, you probably will too. I never venture out there solo.


On the other side of the waterfall, from Rainbow Bridge to the exit of the whirlpool, it‚Äôs no mans land. Nobody is obligated to come to your rescue between those 2 points on the river."
5191,Especially when they go on about pollution. They have no clue what it was like in the 60's. You couldn't swim in Lake Erie.
5192,"Idk bro, it was my first time on a charter let alone one on Lake Erie for walleye. I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect. First fish we reeled in and they were throwing em right in the cooler. He had a hose on the boat and would spray in there every once in a while, not too sure how full of water it was. When we were done he said bring your cooler over and he started throwing em in. I‚Äôm usually a catch and release only fisherman.

Edit: By ‚Äúthey were throwing them in the boat‚Äù, I mean the captain and his son."
5193,"Good article. Infuriating. One bright note, ""In the absence of meaningful regulations protecting Lake Erie,¬†residents of Toledo, Ohio, recently approved a ballot measure¬†granting the water body the same rights as people, which will allow citizens to sue on its behalf. The Ohio Farm Bureau is challenging the results as unconstitutional.""

This seems only fair as ""corporations are people and money is speech."" via citizens united."
5194,"Last time I checked Coachella wasnt wrapped up in a scandal surround the rap of little boys.  


All this praying... yet /r/bad_cop_no_donut continues to see random stories of black people being shot following orders, sitting asleep and prone... Following a god that told slaves to be obedient to their masters...   


$1000 aint for the lord; its so that preacher can existing without real work. His work is the hustle money out of people by selling false hope. I know the community aspect is really important, and that there is a lot of emotional investment... but these people are frauds and charlatans; to use old speak; perpetrating a fraud against vulnerable people.  


The church is like those freemium pay to play games. They prey on the depressed, those who are reaching out for hope, and so on. Maybe ever with the same mechanics. They make you feel obligated. You cant let your team down!  


Where exactly was god for tamir rice? A little kid who used to swim and cook out at lake erie with his family, who was gunned down by a copy another department didnt take because he had emotional issues. Where the fuck was god when unfair housing practices where kettling black people into ghettos and destroying their wealth? God certainly could have nudged someone to not move poisonous industry right next to schools.  


The only thing the lord deserves from humanity is a kick in the teeth and to have its maggot ridden skull smashed against the curb as a finishing move."
5195,"[A 2014 algae bloom in Lake Erie caused a water crisis in Toledo, affecting hundreds of thousands of people.

5196,Went to the Ontario side of lake Erie one time with family. Algae everywhere.
5197,"Amazing how nice of a day it turned out to be here after the shitty weather we had this morning. Great visibility, you can even see the wind turbines near Lake Erie."
5198,Ohio- polluted bottles of lake Erie
5199,"Columbus is nowhere near Lake Erie. Even if it was, I‚Äôve been to Lake Erie and it‚Äôs disgusting."
5200,I would place a nuclear power plant under lake Erie to heat up the water just a little bit in an attempt to catastrophicly increase the amount of lake effect snow that falls in the area south of buffalo!
5201,"This is a terrible idea. The army is only accountable to one man, if you put them in charge of infrastructure communities will lose any input on how the infrastructure is administered. Ohio is now in a 3-4 year battle with the Army Corps of Engineers over where the dredging waste from the Cuyahoga River should be deposited. Ohio wants it placed in land fills, the Army Corps wants to dump it in Lake Erie. 

Congress has appropriated the money to have the waste stored in an environmentally friendly way, but the Army Corps of Engineers is still refusing and has threatened to stop dredging the Cuyahoga.  

The armed forces have no business in the domestic infrastructure market. They are totally unaccountable."
5202,"Me too! It took a while for my parents to convince me to get out of lake Erie because there were no orcas, and to convince my sister to get in the water for the same reason."
5203,Clean lake Erie so I can eat more of the fish I catch without worrying about the mercy mercury levels
5204,Fracking next to a steel mill would be like peeing in lake Erie.
5205,"Colleagues of the house, I am from a district that borders Lake Erie. Many of my constituents have been affected in the past by [harmful algae blooms](https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-environment-watch/lake-eries-algae-bloom-growing-again-after-paralyzing-toledo-water-system) and the threat still looms to this day. These algae blooms are harmful to the marine life of the great lakes, scare people into relying on bottled water because of threat of sickness, and causes a great loss of tax revenue to fix, which can be devastating to already struggling local communities. 

This bill simply adds ""algae blooms"" to a list of defined major disasters and gives the federal executive branch some ability to respond in a quicker amount of time than a legislature would be able to, and possibly more effectively than a local government would be able to, especially a struggling local government. 

The intent is not for the President or the federal government to attempt to solve every issue or provide support for every algae bloom. The existing law says that the President will be the one to determine if a catastrophe is severe enough to warrant federal assistance. I trust that the President will use this power responsibly. I do not think that every algae bloom warrants Presidential attention, but in the possible scenario that there is a very severe algae bloom that warrants federal attention, this bill provides the legal authority for that attention."
5206,"That's awesome. Good on you for cleaning up what you can, every little bit helps! Though the more you look the more garbage you will see, and lake erie's beaches are covered in styrofoam too. It's such a unique area of ontario it's a shame that many locals treat it like their personal dumps. More westward otter and catfish creeks every spring get so full of garbage i'm constantly depressed by how much lost wildlife potential we're missing out on. We do what we can but a large scale effort is desperately needed, I wish the local conservation authorities would show some initiative."
5207,"Earth Day.  Gonna burn a truck tire and then put it out with Freon.  Got a carbon footprint the size of RI.

Yup, Easter Island, the ""Dust Bowl"", Lake Erie, Love Canal, Chernobyl,  Baltimore, is all ""us"".  I am gonna move ""off the grid"" make my own everything and be a professional hacky sack-player.  Build my humble abode out of hi-tech shit that will be around for 10 million years.  Charge my totally synthetic electric car with juice from the oil-fired plant down the road.

Nicotine-laden cigarette butts now line the sides of our roads and no telling how long it will be before the nicotine poisons our ground water.  The solution my friends?  Easy one.  Make it so you can't roll down the car windows!!!!

The ""Earth"" has taken care of itself for more time than we can comprehend.  Yup, we have effected the environment around us.  We will adapt or the Earth will.  Besides, -Cortez says we have less than 20 years left so lets just PARTY!  Where's my charcoal lighter?

5208,"Fun fact: Oak Openings is a globally rare area that is home to 1/3 of Ohio's endangered plant species.  It is rare due to its six types of ecosystems within close proximity: Black Oak/ Lupine Barren, Mesic Sand Tallgrass Prairie, Midwest Sand Barren, Oak/
Blueberry Forest, Great Lakes Pin 
Oak/Swamp White Oak Flatwoods

Shit was fucking incredible, no shells or trash all over the beach, was just me and the group I was with. Living right next to Lake Erie might make me biased but every other beach I've gone to is fucking shit."
5211,"Toxic algae blooms.  Here in Ohio, there is a fight to minimize the runoff into Lake Erie.  The algae blooms typically hit in the warmer months and will kill a lot of fish.  Smells very much bad."
5212,"Lake Erie. It's pretty gross around Cleveland, but there are some pretty nice parts."

5215,"Dandelions in you lawn is not ""squalor"", don't be pretentious. ""Weeds"" can be hard/expensive to get rid of/prevent some people cant afford to have a company out spraying and fertilizing. 

Also it's better for your local environment to have a yard with varying species of native plants in it. Fertilizer can get washed into our waterways and cause issues in our lakes (see toxic algae blooms in lake Erie) and other chemical sprays can harm local insects. We already have an issue with decreasing bee populations. So I'm going to allow the ""weeds"" to grow so that they have something to eat at my yard and the yard snobs down the way will just have to deal with it."
5216,Removed a plastic bag from a tree branch yesterday. Less than a mile from Lake Erie. This is egregious.
5217,"I'm in Ontario. Last summer there was a huge heat wave, and over 900 forest fires in this province alone. On my vacation I tried driving North to see if I could escape the heat wave. I drove up past Barrie, past the fires and smoke in Parry Sound, past Killarney and couldn't escape the heat wave.

We've had several 100 year rain storms and hurricanes in the past decade. In 2017 in Quebec, Ottawa, New Brunswick they had 100 year rain storms and flooding, and it's happening again this year. The weather has changed.

On the positive side, 20 years ago in Toronto the smog was as bad as LA, but since we shut down the coal burning plants the air is amazing, we get way less smog alerts and you can actually see the CN tower most days in the summer.

Also Lake Ontario and Lake Erie used to be cesspools but since the invasion of Zebra mussels they've filtered out a lot of pollution and the water is much cleaner."
5218,"Omg you're in Lake Erie too???

Happy birthday my dude!!! üéâ‚ù§Ô∏è"
5219,"I‚Äôm in Ohio, and we *may* get snow mixed in with rain...unless Lake Erie gets jealous, and  decides to throw up (snow)"
5220,"I'd definitely be interested in seeing a list on the threatened status of each species. Even e.g. the Caspian Sea region's species have many critically endangered species, yes. I knew the problem wasn't just limited to the US/North America.

As I noted in another comment, wikipedia notes that there are 27 species known in modern times, of which 4 are possibly extinct. [This article](https://www.iucn.org/content/sturgeon-more-critically-endangered-any-other-group-species) also paints a fairly grim picture of their situation, but annoyingly that study has also only assessed 18 of the presumably 23 species which are thought to still be around. Are the other 5 known to be just fine? Why isn't that mentioned? I'm not getting a full picture/good overview. Let's see if I can compile one myself...

Subfamily Scaphirhynchinae:

* pallid sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus albus), Missouri &amp; Missisippi rivers, ENDANGERED
* shovelnose sturgeon, Scaphirhynchus platorynchus, Missouri &amp; Mississippi rivers, VULNERABLE, still commercially fished
* Alabama sturgeon, Scaphirhynchus suttkusi, only extant in ~130 miles of the lower Alabama river, CRITICALLY ENDANGERED
* Syr Darya sturgeon (Pseudoscaphirhynchus fedtschenkoi), Syr Darya river/previously the Aral Sea, CRITICALLY ENDANGERED AND LIKELY EXTINCT, no sightings since 1960
* dwarf sturgeon, little shovelnose sturgeon, or small Amu-dar shovelnose sturgeon (Pseudoscaphirhynchus hermanni); Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, CRITICALLY ENDANGERED, but knowledge is sparse
* Amu Darya sturgeon or false shovelnose sturgeon (Pseudoscaphirhynchus kaufmanni), same countries as the previous, CRITICALLY ENDANGERED

Subfamily Acipenserinae:

* kaluga (Huso dauricus), Amur river basin (Russian Far East/Northeast China), CRITICALLY ENDANGERED
* beluga or European sturgeon (Huso huso), Caspian and Black Seas, sometimes the Adriatic, CRITICALLY ENDANGERED
* Siberian sturgeon (Acipenser baerii), all major Siberian river basins, ENDANGERED
* Baikal sturgeon, Acipenser baerii baicalensis, subspecies of the previous, found in the Lake Baikal and the Selenga river, ENDANGERED
* shortnose sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum), eastern North America from Florida to New Brunswick, VULNERABLE
* Dabry's sturgeon (Acipenser dabryanus), Yangtze River Basin, CRITICALLY ENDANGERED, would likely be extinct if not for captive breeding (doesn't seem to be breeding in the wild)
* lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens), North America, LEAST CONCERN as a species, but rare in many places, e.g. the Lake Erie fishery has collapsed, and 19 out of 20 US states in its original range list it as threatened or endangered
* Russian sturgeon (Acipenser gueldenstaedtii), several countries, including Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, Russia, Kazakstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Iran, and the Caucasus countries and Caspian Sea in the middle of those, CRITICALLY ENDANGERED
* green sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris), Pacific Ocean/China, Russia, Canada, US, NEAR THREATENED
* Sakhalin sturgeon (Acipenser mikadoi), Japan and Russia, CRITICALLY ENDANGERED
* Adriatic sturgeon (Acipenser naccarii), Adriatic sea and neighbouring countries' large rivers, CRITICALLY ENDANGERED, possibly extinct/not spawning in the wild, but being bred in captivity.
* bastard sturgeon, fringebarbel sturgeon, ship sturgeon, spiny sturgeon, or thorn sturgeon (Acipenser nudiventris), formerly Black, Aral and Caspian seas, now maybe only the Ural river and possibly a couple of others, healthiest population is an introduced one in a lake in Kazakhstan, supposedly reproduces the best out of all sturgeons, CRITICALLY ENDANGERED
* Gulf sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus desotoi), 1/2 subspecies, Gulf of Mexico, VULNERABLE
* Atlantic sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus oxyrinchus), 2/2 subspecies, eastern North America from Florida to New Brunswick, [historically had also colonised the Baltic sea region](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2527320/) but now extinct there, NEAR THREATENED (same for the species as a whole)
* Persian sturgeon (Acipenser persicus), Caspian and Black seas, certain rivers, CRITICALLY ENDANGERED
* sterlet (Acipenser ruthenus), Black, Azov and Caspian sea, rivers in Siberia, VULNERABLE
* Japanese sturgeon, or Amur sturgeon (Acipenser schrenckii), Amur River basin, China and Russia, CRITICALLY ENDANGERED
* Chinese sturgeon (Acipenser sinensis), formerly China, Japan, and Korean peninsula, CRITICALLY ENDANGERED, many populations are extinct
* starry sturgeon (Acipenser stellatus), Black, Azov, Caspian and Aegean seas, extinct in the Aegaen and much of it's former river range, CRITICALLY ENDANGERED
* European sea sturgeon (Acipenser sturio), most coasts of Europe, CRITICALLY ENDANGERED
* White sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), Eastern Pacific from the Gulf of Alaska to possibly northern Baja California, LEAST CONCERN, despite being near exctinction in the early 1900s. Is one of a few species that are farmed.

Doing a save to count each status, although I definitely agree that your general assessment seems to have been correct...

The count is:

* Critically endangered 16, including 1-3 possibly extinct/extinct in the wild
* Endangered 3
* Vulnerable 4
* Near threatened 2
* Least concern 2

Just for the sake of nitpicking, YMMV if 70% (19/27) is a vast majority, but it's not unambiguously *not* a vast majority either, so I'm going to say yes in this case.

But in any case, hopefully someone else found the previous list enlightening/helpful."
5221,This would be a great resource to learn from. I live in the Northeast Ohio area and we‚Äôre set to get wind turbines on Lake Erie in 2021 as a nearby coal plant is also set to close the same year. I wish this would happen way sooner but every success deserves recognition
5222,"Sorry...too busy here in NE Ohio enjoying Cuyahoga Valley National Park, the Metroparks, Lake Erie, wine country, University Circle, James Beard chefs, public transportation, and cities that don‚Äôt feel like giant suburbs to argue with you."
5223,"I live about 30 minutes away from Niagara Falls. This still pretty much happens. It gets super cold and we get a lot of snow because of Lake Erie. So the whole ""no thoughts of global warming in 1920s"" is pretty misleading since this day and age we have a lot of thoughts about global warming and yet you can still see the falls freeze like this."
5224,"There was a thread on Reddit recently about the army core of engineers wanting to dredge the Cuyahoga river, and dump the sediment into Lake Erie.  There was a lot of concern over the amount of nasty stuff that may have settled into the layers of sediment over the years.  The water may be cleaner now, but there‚Äôs still enough stuff to be concerned about dumping that sediment into the lake -which provides drinking water for many people, and sustains a popular fishery."
5225,You‚Äôre thinking of Cleveland and Lake Erie I think?  Happened back in the 70s when we still shit all over our environment.
5226,"yeah i feel kind of stupid for not learning about it earlier but in February this year toledo ohio gave lake erie equal rights as human beings, so who knew"
5227,"The poverty wages are a part of the problem. Americans expect their food to be cheap, which requires poverty or slave wages. Europeans pay more for food, and their food isn‚Äôt raised with so many high-tech shortcuts like CAFOs. Americans would happily farm if it didn‚Äôt pay peanuts, but it‚Äôs cheap because immigrants or foreigners (for imported food) usually do the work, and most of all because the government gives huge subsidies to make staple crops cheap.

But conventionally-grown staple crops (corn, wheat, soy), animal feed, and the animals that eat them are ruining Americans‚Äô health (antibiotic pesticides make the animals and humans fat‚Äîthat‚Äôs how antibiotics work‚Äînow you know why we have an obesity problem‚Äîalso diabetes and cardiovascular problems are out of control‚Äîand this can all be linked directly to poor gut health from the toxic chemicals and Frankenfood we eat). They‚Äôre also ruining our waterways and air just as much as the industrial pollution did 50 years ago. 

The food system supporting the American diet we‚Äôre eating is completely unsustainable with tons of externalized costs that are catching up to us in our medical bills and algae blooms. Big corporations are making bazillions of bucks off of poverty wages, taxpayer subsidies, and polluted waterways. The money is there to pay farmers better and treat the planet better, but it means these corporations will lose power.

So if you think we ‚Äúcan‚Äôt‚Äù change how we farm because of money‚Äîyou‚Äôre absolutely right. And until the economics are changed and these big corporations are forced to pay for the damage they‚Äôre doing, we can‚Äôt really change anything. And the economics are all affected directly by the policies set at especially the federal level. There are ways to change the dynamics, but the politicians are happy to leave it alone since their campaigns are being supported by these corporations. And if they lose an election or retire from public office, these corporations are happy to employ them as lobbyists. 

It‚Äôs an insidious game where everyone thinks that changing the status quo would be too painful or scary. Consumers want to save money on buying food since they eat every day. Farmers like not having to deal with animals AND corn, they can now pick just one and it‚Äôs easy because all the chemicals and whatnot make it easier. Big corporations like making big bucks selling pesticides, seeds, food, and whatever else for whatever prices they choose because most are monopolies or monopsonies, and they have no real competition. The people who don‚Äôt like it are a small minority, or a huge amount of poor people who are too busy to care about politics.

And so we will continue to have toxic algae blooms in Lake Erie because people are less afraid of undrinkable water than they are of paying more for food."
5228,"[This lake has legal rights, just like you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwhcrpJTzGQ) \- Vox Video

The video is about Lake Erie, [The Lake Erie Bill of Rights](https://ballotpedia.org/Toledo,_Ohio,_Question_2,_%22Lake_Erie_Bill_of_Rights%22_Initiative_(February_2019)), and ""Rights of Nature"" in general. It is short and spends a good chunk of time on the specific environmental facts involved, but it does cover the general idea behind Rights of Nature as well. 

Rights of Nature, as covered in the video at least, are about granting specific natural areas rights and standing to sue over those rights. If similarities to Corporate Personhood and Citizens United pop into your head, well they mention those in the video (as well as Hobby Lobby). 

Rights of Nature sounds Blue coded to me (but that may just be because the video is from Vox), as is opposition to Citizens United. If this is or becomes a bigger blue issue, then we may soon have dueling ""personhoods"". One crowd shouts at another ""Corporations aren't people"" and the other replies ""Lakes aren't people"". 

As for the actual idea, I'm unsure. At first glance, I'm wary of just throwing around Rights. The more Rights of this sort we have the more they will end up treading on each other and the less useful they are. On the other hand, it does seem to be one way of solving the tragedy of the commons.

Does anyone have experience with Rights of Nature or the people trying to spread the idea?"
5229,"&gt; It's hard to say how fast Erie wants the forest cycle to run,

I think it's pretty easy: *Lake* Erie doesn't want anything because it has no desires or consciousness.

&gt; but it's really easy to say that filling in the lake with industrial waste is not compatible with the right to exist, flourish, and naturally evolve.

*It's a big blob of water.* If Lake Erie has rights then so does my bathtub."
5230,"It‚Äôs like where I live, NE Ohio is right by Lake Erie. Every. Single. Year. there are drownings of people who did actually know how to swim but underestimated the Lake. They went out too far, or when it was too cold, or tried to walk/drive on it thinking it was frozen enough."
5231,"It‚Äôs not that simple.  In addition to animal manure, excess fertilizer on crops and soil erosion make agriculture one of the largest sources of nitrogen and phosphorus which hit our waterways and cause this.  The harmful algae blooms that recently plagued Lake Erie were in part fueled by fertilizer runoff from industrial corn and soybean farms.

A number of issues need to be tackled to rectify this."
5232,It's farm runoff. Lake Erie bill of rights might help

I was going to mention that thank Christ they're finally out of there, their target wasn't Stelco though, it was Lake Erie works for the coke, so they didn't give a shit what happened in Hamilton, *and* I believe they still own the Lake Erie factory, it was just Stelco they relinquished. Got away with all that Government money, and tried to Weasley out of pension responsibilities, and only got a slap on the wrists. Bunch of cocksuckers they are, along with the Harper government that enabled them."

5244,Toronto v Buffalo GDT‚Äôs are the reason Lake Erie is turning into a salt lake. Both of our fanbases are so miserable when it comes to the other.
5245,"This is entirely off-topic, but I think you should add this to your ""think about it"" list.

50 years ago, you could not drive through Gary, Indiana without having your eyes water and your lungs burn.  The effluvia (&lt;-I have the best words) from the smokestacks turned the sky a revolting shade of orangey brown.

50 years ago we were taught in grade school that Lake Erie was ""dead"".  There was nothing living in it.  No fish, no plants, no paramecium.

In the 60's and 70's, the ""Tree Hugging Hippy Lib'ruls"" got laws passed that required regulations on what companies could put into the air and water - and the industries SCREAMED and shouted and stamped their feet and held their breath until they turned blue - but eventually most of them complied, and put filters in their smokestacks and stopped dumping crap into the lakes, and eventually the Cuyahoga River stopped spontaneously combusting...

Science and Government can work together very well to combat the excesses of those who think that nobody but themselves matters, and their ""bottom line"" is more important than people's lives and health.

5246,"Geologist here, it looks like I‚Äôm a bit late to the party but from looks I would guess it‚Äôs a combination of heavy metals and sulphur. I‚Äôve done a bit of environmental work in mining and a stream that gets constant pollution or a large rain event will usually look something like that. Depending on what kind of coal they are extracting from the mine would also tell you a lot. Bituminous coal which is a pretty common type of coal that is mined today is a dirty cheap coal. Usually contains sulphur and iron. Anyway after oxidation you get that pretty color. Perhaps a bit more dangerous though would be how high (if any) the lead concentration is. Which is why it‚Äôs pretty important to get a sample (an empty Gatorade bottle was always a field favorite) and get it over to your local public water management service. I‚Äôm sure the West Virginia department of environmental protection would like to hear about it if they haven‚Äôt already. 

Edit: I should‚Äôve also mentioned the heavy metals will kill most if not all life in that stream and wherever it leads. And heavy metals leach into ground water. So any wells dug around there will eventually be polluted as well. 

Edit Edit: depending on whom op spoke to about this being ‚Äúnormal‚Äù it might actually be normal because it‚Äôs an impaired stream.

5247,"Ok sooooo, this is just not true. 

I grew up right next Lake Erie, grew up boating all over the great lakes, arguably some of the most polluted freshwater on the planet, and it does not have any of what you just described. 

In marinas where the water is clear, i see nothing but seaweed, fish, sand, and rocks pulled up from the dredging. "
5248,"Well, good on the boaties in Lake Erie for not pumping their bilges or spilling diesel in the water then.

I don't know how many boats on Lake Erie there are, but there are thousands on Sydney Harbour. I've spent the last 5 or 6 years around charter boats and every single marina I have been in has been like this.

It is known that you are not meant to use dispersants, illegal in fact, but people do it all the time. Most marinas fine boat owners for diesel or oil discharge so they just dump dispersant on it to avoid the fine. Common detergents work ok too."
5249,"Coal isn't the only thing poisoning our waters. Phosphorus run off from agriculture and over fertilization has turned parts of Lake Erie green with algae, toxic algae. Google Lake Erie algae blooms and look at those pictures. That's our drinking water. Toledo, Ohio had a water crisis a few years back when the amount of toxic algae could not be filtered out without over chemicalizing the water supply, which is also bad. Worse yet, the public wasn't notified for months. Lake Erie is in crisis every summer and taxpayers are fitting the bill for nearly a billion dollars in treatment upgrades. The local municipalities have tried  to get Lake Erie on the impaired waters lists so that Federal dollars can be used to clean up the lake however the EPA has rejected that claim. "
5250,"My apologies, this is going to be very long.

Have you ever lived on or visited a factory farm and talked to the farmers? 78% of cows that we eat come from them, so it's very relevant. I'm from rural Ohio, so I have, and my father's family raised cows.

Most of the time when a male calf is born, they very immediately pull it from the mother cow. Cows being social animals, this is incredibly distressing. To ensure the meat stays tender they want to avoid the cows getting testosterone, so they either cut the balls out with a scalpel or crush the spermatic cords with a clamp until they're crushed to nothing. Unlike humans, we don't give them painkillers after. It fucking hurts.

They then ranch it for 6 months to a year (separated from its mother, which is, may I repeat, about as distressing as pulling any given 4 year old away from theirs) as it's growing, and then send it (often for hundreds of miles) for the last 6 months of its life a CAFO (concentrated animal feeding operation.) Then they get hauled off to slaughter on a probably shorter journey. Animals legally must be rendered insensate before they are slaughtered, but, of course, this can fail. 

The problem with feeding them soy and corn is that this is an absurdly inefficient way to get your food. We have crises regarding water availability, widespread ecological damage from nitrogen and phosphorous (You can't drink out of lake erie sometimes because of fertilizer runoff in the cornfields that we use to feed the cows). 

The return on investment on the calories in the form of grain/corn/soy is between 1/5th and 1/20th depending on what you feed the cows, where the cows live, and the breed of the cows. It's a massive investment for a relatively low (and unhealthy, in the absurd quantities that average Americans eat meat) return on investment that causes a lot of ecological problems, because whatever's happening, we're not feeding those cows shit that was grown without using the fertilizers that cause algae blooms and damage the great lakes, US rivers, and estuaries. 

This is how it works, and they do not live happily. They live distressed and isolated lives, often in pain from branding or actually just having their balls crushed, before being moved into a shitty pen with toxic air to be fed for 6 months until they die."
5251,"That's always a concern in areas like this.  I wouldn't be opposed to Cleveland and/or Cuyahoga County using some tax money to help mitigate the cost. 

That being said, the article states that GLBCo. did enough research and study prior to purchase where they are comfortable with it.

The key will be providing direct access to the water for the general public.  That's where government needs to really step in and do their part.  Traveling to other cities, they make it a point to have public access to all waterfronts.  Cleveland has done a terrible job with this in the past.  Whether its beaches, boardwalks, barriers/railings, direct access, people want to be able to get down to the water.  It can't be just reserved for private businesses to put patios.

In Cleveland, we have a very unique environment with a major river and great lake.  Lake Erie development is at least 10 years away, so developing the the river front would be a major step that could help expedite/facilitate the lake front developments. "

You go south your protected by the mountains and even more rivers and lakes. Going east would be hard as there are more mountains and tough terrain and west is ok but it gets flatter and resources more sparse.

The western basin of Lake Erie is especially prone to algal blooms caused by runoff from farms. That has commercial impacts (fishing and tourism) and also on the residents of that part of Ohio.  The algae makes water drawn from the lake unfit to use for drinking.   

The problem has been exacerbated by climate change.  Because the frequency and intensity of severe storms, more fertilizer is being washed into the watershed more often.  And because the nutrients in that fertilizer winds up in the lake, instead of being absorbed by crops as intended, yields are down. 

It's a nasty double edged sword: farmers are acknowledging the reality of climate change, because it is affecting them directly. But it's also going to out a lot of them out of business and lead to more consolidation of farming by megafarms that rely on mechanization and fertilizers and pesticides/herbicides to remain profitable, which will continue to exacerbate the problem.

They had well water. Of course working in programs like nerve agent (essentially pesticides) treatments, my mind went straight to some form of environmental contaminant. As a mother, since my child wants to go play in Winter's Run near our house, I want to make certain that we have clean water and air and our kids aren't being poisoned when they play in it. The Chesapeake Bay is critical not just as a jewel of the district, but it's also a large part of our economy. We have to restore the natural processes that clean the water. We also have these storms hitting our eastern shore causing significant damage, and chronic flooding will soon be if not already is a MAJOR issue in MD-01, so it is imperative that we address these things. On food systems, obviously you have similar concerns about what pesticides are being used, but in addition to environmental concerns, I get concerned about reductions in standards like those proposed in King's amendment to the Farm Bill (it was essentially the lowest common  denominator approach and undermining state regs like in the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act) and things like horse slaughter, because when we allow American horses, which are given medicines known to be toxic for humans to consume, and then they are shipped off to other countries for slaughter for human consumption, 1) we're poisoning other countries' food supplies, and 2) that meat is processed in the same plants as much of our beef, and we're finding horse DNA in our meat products. 

I know this is not laid out very clearly - it has been a long day and I will try to return and clear it up in the future. I think the takeaway is that you can count on me to make sure that we have a clean environment and that we are protecting our land and waterways, because our future literally depends on it. I may not be an expert in all of these things but I definitely know who to call.

Re the TMDL requirements, this is not my area of expertise and I would phone an expert. However, it seems as though looking for ways to reduce them would be wise and worth investing in - and I would absolutely lean on the northern watershed states to make sure they‚Äôre doing their part to meet the clean water goals of the Bay.

5304,"Generally speaking the water quality of the Lake Erie is really good.  But storms can stir up water that brings a lot of sediment to the surface, this sediment can contain high levels of bacteria.  Also, in later summer months, the lake experiences algae blooms where algae can grow pretty thick on the surface of the water.  The algae can, doesn't always, but can produce toxins that will make you sick.

The Ohio Department of Heath does regular testing (3-4 times a week) of the beaches and publishes the results online and issues advisories when necessary.

&gt; In order to accommodate sea planes, Cleveland's downtown airport was built on mostly clean fill dumped in the lake, meaning it was a combination of building and highway construction excavation from the period. Some dredging from the Cuyahoga River and Lake Erie was also used. A garbage dump occupied about 20 to 30 acres of the airport on the far northeast portion of the property until it closed in the late 1950s. The Ohio EPA found in 1987 that the dump area posed a ""low threat"" for land or surface water contamination and would not be considered for any ""remedial action"" list of properties that had hazardous materials problems.

&gt; ""The perception that Burke is built on a garbage dump and cannot be used for anything else is a public misperception that refuses to go away,"" says Ted Esborn, a Cleveland attorney who worked in the city's law and health department in the '80s and '90s. ""The EPA has never found this to be a superfund site, and to the extent they built the terminal and a high school on it, it is obvious you would be able to build other structures on it as well.""

&gt; Ohio EPA spokesman James Lee told Scene that the Ohio EPA ""is not aware of any additional sampling or studies at this property"" that would indicate any environmental issues from the landfill, and that the state agency ""is eager and available to work with the city, if assistance is needed.""

to answer your question, yes i would like a mix of green space and development. look to the transistion meigs field in chicago did. as far as what could go there? look at something like Henry W.

It‚Äôs a real eye-opener. And you can also find the list of streams with TMDL projects, where the TCEQ has plans to do something.

Amazing zoo and MetroParks system. The Rock Hall of Fame (and not far from the NFL Hall of Fame).  All on the shore of Lake Erie, and for prices a lot cheaper than more ""destination"" cities.

Yeah, the EPA story is complicated.  What you are saying sounds good in theory, but given the proposed EPA budget cuts, and the staff cuts already, there are probably a lot of companies ""risking it"" these days knowing there are a lot less investigators and so on.   So, some damage is already being done, but it could be turned around relatively quickly.

&gt;Swiftly, reforms in the ‚Äúworkforce reshaping‚Äù started in May 2017 when EPA began discarding staff by offering $25,000 buyouts to those at or near retirement age. Although 372 employees took the incentive, EPA did not replace them. All told, over 700 personnel have left EPA since Trump took office, and virtually no one has been hired to replenish their roles.

&gt;Worse, when EPA revealed to the Washington Examiner that it planned to reduce its‚Äô staff by half by 2020, the plan was more breathtaking in its scope and ambition than most had previously imagined. 

&gt;Losing essential EPA staff means fewer inspectors checking smoke stacks for smog, scientists not sampling nitrogen and phosphorus in the Chesapeake Bay, technicians absent to analyze lead and copper in communities‚Äô drinking water, biologists unable to monitor for aquatic life in Lake Erie‚Äôs oxygen-depleted dead zone. The environmental cops on the beat will soon be gone.

However in the late 60's and early 70's the bacterial load in the lake forced closure to swimming of all of Michigan's Lake Erie coast into the Toledo area as far east as Port Clinton. The major fix was was to water treatment in the entire Great Lakes basin west of Erie, until the Detroit River detoxed enough which was a 20 year effort. The happy news is swimming is safe again all over, but Toledo Beach is left in private hands. The cleanup let Sterling State Park in Monroe reopen it's beaches, and was the reason Maumee Bay State Park could be created - to everyone's amazement and amid concerns at the time of the safety of swimming there, as by that time a generation grew up thinking swimming in the lake was dangerous. My own happy story was the beach at the end of my subdivision reopened (I'm near Sterling)."

5337,"&gt;If we take Lake Erie and change it, and make it as green as the part around Toledo, then the carbon emissions from the lake increases two-and-a-half more times and the atmospheric impact is equivalent to adding another seven million cars on the road.

If that's the case the investing in some boats to skim this stuff off the surface of the water seems like a good idea. What the most efficient thing to do with it after is I don't know. Composting to make fertilizer, turning into biomass fuel or using it for carbon capture? Any option seems better than doing nothing."

[Here's the most recent state of the bay report from 2016](http://www.cbf.org/about-the-bay/state-of-the-bay-report/2016/). A new one will come out this year and give a better idea of improvements. I would imagine a sizable boost in water clarity and underwater grasses. The blooms this year [have been incredibly promising](https://www.wm.edu/news/stories/2018/underwater-grasses-in-chesapeake-bay-continue-record-growth.php) and they are one of the largest factors in health since besides providing habitat, they hold in sediment to improve water clarity and produce oxygen to help combat dead zones, which combine to promote more underwater growth and sustain more life. Current TMDL initiatives around Maryland have helped, but there's still a lot of work left to do. Particularly around Baltimore and DC, aging sanitary systems release a ridiculous amount of raw sewage into the bay. When most of the 64,000 square mile watershed is in PA and NY, it will take a lot of efforts from those states as well which is harder to do when they don't reap the benefits of the bay or suffer the consequences themselves. Farmers in PA add a great deal of nitrogen pollution from fertilizing their farms. Increased nitrogen causes algal blooms which in turn decrease dissolved oxygen content when bacteria break down the blooms. And on top of all of this, the Conowingo Dam at the top of the bay which should help control this runoff is [in a dire situation](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/investigations/bs-md-conowingo-dam-20170715-story.html).

5356,"&gt; and it is not necessary for survival

Many things are not ""necessary"" for survival. That does not mean they are not *beneficial* for survival. Intelligence is unquestionably beneficial. 

&gt;  I am curious to know if you guys think high intelligence is dominant in nature or will eventually cause us to become extinct.

It is certainly possible, but if there is a way out of these issues, our intelligence is key to finding it. 

&gt; We can see that our life span is increasing and over population is becoming an issue, but at the same time we are slowly causing the earth to be unsustainable for life (obviously very slowly: deforestation, depleting of the ozone, etc).

Your question is the entire topic of Stephen Pinker's wonderful book [Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress](https://www.amazon.com/Enlightenment-Now-Science-Humanism-Progress-ebook/dp/B073TJBYTB/). He makes the very compelling case that most of the things we are worried about are either not really problems at all, or they have practical solutions if we just apply ourselves. This isn't just some baseless opinion, he actually makes his case with very strong evidence. 

For example, in the case of both of the examples you cite, we have already turned the corner on those problems. 

For deforestation:

&gt; Many of the improvements can be seen with the naked eye. Cities are less often shrouded in purple-brown haze, and London no longer has the fog‚Äîactually coal smoke‚Äîthat was immortalized in Impressionist paintings, gothic novels, the Gershwin song, and the brand of raincoats. Urban waterways that had been left for dead‚Äîincluding Puget Sound, Chesapeake Bay, Boston Harbor, Lake Erie, and the Hudson, Potomac, Chicago, Charles, Seine, Rhine, and Thames rivers (the last described by Disraeli as ‚Äúa Stygian pool reeking with ineffable and intolerable horrors‚Äù)‚Äîhave been recolonized by fish, birds, marine mammals, and sometimes swimmers. Suburbanites are seeing wolves, foxes, bears, bobcats, badgers, deer, ospreys, wild turkeys, and bald eagles. As agriculture becomes more efficient (chapter 7 ), farmland returns to temperate forest, as any hiker knows who has stumbled upon a stone wall incongruously running through a New England woodland. Though tropical forests are still, alarmingly, being cut down, between the middle of the 20th century and the turn of the 21st the rate fell by two-thirds (figure 10-4 ).  Deforestation of the world‚Äôs largest tropical forest, the Amazon, peaked in 1995, and from 2004 to 2013 the rate fell by four-fifths. 

He doesn't seem to address ozone depletion in the book (at least it's not in the index, but I thought I remembered him talking about it), but it is generally considered one of the biggest successes in the history of environmentalism. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_depletion):

&gt; The ban came into effect in 1989. Ozone levels stabilized by the mid-1990s and began to recover in the 2000s. Recovery is projected to continue over the next century, and the ozone hole is expected to reach pre-1980 levels by around 2075.[4] The Montreal Protocol is considered the most successful international environmental agreement to date.

That is not to say that we aren't still facing real issues, but he makes the case that the only way we can address the real issues we face is by embracing our intelligence, and stopping the war on science that so many  people on both the right and left are engaged in. It really is an eye-opening book, and I cannot recommend it highly enough.

Edit: I'll add that if you are an audiobook fan, I really liked the audiobook of Enlightenment now. The Narrator does an excellent job, and made what was a fairly dense bit of information easier to digest. 

Edit 2: I just saw the book [Factfulness: Ten Reasons We're Wrong About the World - and Why Things Are Better Than You Think](https://www.amazon.com/Factfulness-Reasons-Wrong-Things-Better/dp/B07BFDCWZP) linked from Pinker's book. While I have not read it, from the reviews it seems to cover much of the same information as Pinker's book and might be easier to digest. I just bought the audio book, so I will try to remember to update this review after I finish it. First note, though, the narrator is not as good as Pinker's.

5359,"Yeah we totally forgot about the recession too. Very common American mistake.

The area was inhabited from about 1000 B.C. to 1000 A.D. by the Native American¬†Hopewell culture. Later, according to Oral histories, Algonquian peoples from the East Coast were driven west when Iroquoian people migrated to the region from central Canada and took their original homelands‚ÄîThese being the ancestors of the Ojibwe, Odawa, Potowatomi, Mascouten &amp; Miami. Archaeology shows that this probably occurred during the 12th-13th centuries. Originally, the northern peninsula was largely claimed by the¬†Ojibwe¬†nation, although the border region of Wisconsin was claimed by the¬†Menominee. Given that one of the oldest recorded names for the tribe was also the¬†Mackinac,¬†[6]¬†they most likely predate the other Algonquians in the region. The entire southern peninsula was home to a tribe called the¬†Mascouten¬†[7][8]¬†until the¬†Beaver Wars, which was probably home to a mixture of Algonquian &amp; Siouan peoples before. Their southern border seems to very clearly be the Maumee River of Ohio &amp; their territory extended around Lake Michigan into Indiana. During the Beaver Wars, the Iroquois of New York pushed other tribes in league with the French hard against Lake Huron, therefore several tribes migrated into Michigan &amp; declared war on the Mascouten &amp; Miami. The most likely identity for these tribes were the Erie, Chonnonton &amp; Anishinaabeg. The Iroquoian tribes quickly continued on into northern &amp; eastern Ohio &amp; the Anishinaabeg groups seem to have formed the¬†Sauk¬†&amp;¬†Fauktribes by the time of the oldest surviving maps of the region, 1641. Either this, or the Sauk &amp; Fauk were chased into the region after defeats further east. Due to the Beaver Wars, the Mascouten migrated down to settle around the Wabash River.

Given the fact that they are culturally related &amp; the Mascouten disappear from maps of the region around the same time that the new name appears, they may have later become known as the Wea, or Wabash tribe.[9][10][11]

Afterwards, the Iroquois defeated the other Iroquoian tribes of northern Ohio‚Äîthe Chonnonton, Erie &amp; Petun‚Äîand continued into southern Michigan by the 1660s.[12]¬†With the Iroquoians having conquered the southern peninsula for themselves, the other Algonquians began to refer to the nearby lake as Michigan, which translates to ""Big Cat"" in their language. This is most likely supposed to be a reference to the Iroquoian water deity known as 'Blue Panther', or, more accurately, ""Cat which Stalks Below.""¬†[13][14]¬†They defeated the Sauk &amp; Fauk, who migrated west and took refuge among the Ojibwe &amp; Menominee. This caused other wars between Algonquian &amp; Siouan peoples within the following decades.[15]

Later, the Anishinaabeg tribes north of Lake Superior (who were already allied with the Huron) migrated down to the Lake Erie region, claiming some land in southern Michigan. In the U.S., they were known as the Odawa, &amp; in Canada they were known as the¬†Mississaugas‚Äîboth deriving from tribal &amp; subtribal names of the Anishinaabeg. The French migrated west, settling the colony of Illinois around 1680, which claimed all the land between the Great Lakes, Ohio River, Mississippi River &amp; Appalachian mountains. Together with their native allies, they chased the Iroquois out of the region by 1701, forcing them to sign a treaty recognizing the Niagara River &amp; the Ohio-Pennsylvania borders as the ends of their lands.

In the meantime, other tribes which had settled in Ohio were continuously pushed west by new settlers. Some settled in southern Michigan, however these were mostly the Iroquoian¬†Wyandot. Rumor also has it that a group of Piscataway (An Algonquian tribe from Maryland) called the Conoy migrated into West Virginia &amp; were noted as living around modern-day Detroit by 1819.[16]¬†If true, they most likely merged with the Odawa. During the War of 1812, tribes who sided against the United States were punished by seizure of land. With the Indian Removal Act (best known for causing the Trail of Tears in the south) of the 1830s, many natives were pushed away from Ohio &amp; Michigan, many choosing to return to Canada. Despite this, many native tribesmen were able to remain, if they forewent their tribal allegiances &amp; became American citizens. It was the later laws of 50 years later, outlawing Native American culture to control other tribes of the west, which permanently destroyed this heritage.[17]

The Ojibwe called their land Mishi-Anishinaabaki (Mey-shih-Ah-ney-shih-nah-baaah-key), or Greater Anishinaabe Land. Since Anishinaabe was a collective term for the Ojibwe, Odawa &amp; Potowatomi/ Nishnabe, who formed a governed confederacy known as the Three Council Fires,[18]¬†most of the Algonquian peoples around Lake Superior referred to their lands as 'something Anishinaabaki.' This most likely confused the French, who chose to simply translate the 'Mishi' part as ""Superior."" Although the Anishinaabeg (plural) didn't have a true, organized government (They would usually elect temporary leaders called Ogidamoo in the moment.[19]¬†), the sacred site of their council fire, where they would conduct important political business, was known as¬†Michilimackinac. Today, it's known as¬†Mackinac Island. The Mascouten are supposedly so named for calling their original homeland of southern Michigan ""Maskoutenich,"" or ""The Treeless Land,"" for the Erie Plains region.[20][21]

The first European explorer to visit Michigan was the Frenchman¬†√âtienne Br√ªl√©¬†in 1620, who began his expedition from¬†Quebec Cityon the orders of¬†Samuel de Champlain¬†and traveled as far as the¬†Upper Peninsula. Eventually, the area became part of¬†Canada, one of the large colonial provinces of¬†New France. The first permanent European settlement in Michigan was founded in 1668 at¬†Sault Ste. Marie¬†by¬†Jacques Marquette, a French missionary.

The French built several trading posts, forts, and villages in Michigan during the late 17th century. Among them, the most important was¬†Fort Pontchartrain du D√©troit¬†in 1701; it became the city of¬†Detroit. Up until this time, French activities in the region were limited to hunting, trapping, trading with and the conversion of local Indians, and some limited subsistence farming. By 1760, the Michigan countryside had only a few hundred white inhabitants.

5362,"For comparison, 8.4 billion gallons of sewage were dumped into lake erie (U.S. freshwater lake) in 2004 alone.  The main contributors were Cleveland Metro, Toledo-Maumee, and Akron-Canton Metro.  So basically one could slaughter humanity and drain their blood into Lake Erie over the course of a year and a half and it wouldnt cause the lake to crest assuming water was still pulled from the lake at the same rate before humanitys untimely demise."

As someone that's lived in Dublin OH, Hoover AL and Sanibel FL, the 30-60 degrees warmer all winter and never seeing snow WAY MORE than makes up for the 5 degrees warmer in the summer. Also, when it gets too hot down here, you just go to the beach. A lot of SEC schools are &gt;2 hr drive to the beach.

5388,"My focus was on Griff2wenth2's summary statement, ""cleanup was what caused the formation of CVNP"", that may also be tricky close...but is it an accurate takeaway? I probably should have linked [this](https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/a-park-for-the-people.htm) instead where it states, ""One of the first private organizations to call for a Cuyahoga Valley park was the Lake Erie Watershed Conservation Foundation. Executive Director George Watkins felt that if valley land development continued unchecked, soil erosion and flooding would worsen and wash more pollution down the Cuyahoga River into Lake Erie. Watkins began to work closely with another politically minded individual,John F. Seiberling, who had grown up near the valley at Stan Hywet Hall. Seiberling was then chairman of the Tri-County Regional Planning Commission and later a U.S. Congressman."" 

Earlier it also states this, ""Although regional parks safeguarded certain places, by the 1960s local citizens feared that urban sprawl would overwhelm the Cuyahoga Valley‚Äôs quiet beauty. Early efforts to slow development focused on fighting individual projects and rarely met with success. Active citizens joined forces with state and national government staff to explore options for a long-term solution. Eventually local leaders concluded that the valley should become a National Park Service (NPS) site"" 

So from my reading (please correct me if wrong), the idea to turn it into a national park was forming in the 60's though it didn't get National Park designation until later. It did, however, get national status as Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area (CVNRA) on December 27, 1974, as you alluded to.  John Seiberling was chairman of the Tri-County Commission between 1964-1970 per his [congressional bio](http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=S000230). It seems to me the river burning at the end of his commission term and the subsequent Clean Water act and Sieberling's election to congress contributed, but the idea was already there."

Also, taken from the Wikipedia page:

&gt;In November 2006, it was revealed that several other young girls had received phone calls similar to that to which Mihaljevic responded, during the weeks prior to her abduction in 1989. These comprised requests from an unknown man, claiming to work with their mother, asking the girl to help him shop for a present to celebrate her mother's job promotion. The girls who received these calls lived in North Olmsted, a suburb near Bay Village; some had unlisted phone numbers. This new information was considered significant by new movement on the case. Mihaljevic and the others who received such calls had all visited the local Lake Erie Nature and Science Center, which had a visitors' logbook by the front door that the girls may have signed, possibly adding other personal information such as addresses.

5403,"&gt;Animal production has the potential to negatively affect surface water quality (from pathogens, phosphorus, ammonia, and organic matter); ground water quality (from nitrate); soil quality (from soluble salts, copper, arsenic, and zinc); and air quality (from odors, dust, pests, and aerial pathogens). Manure and other byproducts of animal production, if not carefully managed, will have a significant negative impact on the environment. Agricultural production has been identified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as the largest single contributor to water quality impairment for rivers and lakes.

Notice they say, ""agricultural production"" and not ""livestock production"". In case you're not familiar with the Ohio area, every year Lake Erie sees a runoff of fertilizer from the Miami watershed that absolutely kills the lake. Huge algal blooms and massive wildlife die off.

That is all due to crop cultivation. So crops are not free from these effects.

Here is another thing to consider, vast areas of the midwest are best suited for crowing corn. Most of that is fed to animals, which leads to inefficiency in energy usage, of course, but that is largely offset by the huge efficiency gain in growing corn to begin with. Essentially, growing food for human consumption would be unprofitable. 

And you mentioned crop rotation. Often, the best crops for rotation are animal feed such as grasses or alfalfa. This helps the farmer improve his yields and also feeds animals, with no detriment. It is very rarely the case that someone chooses either consumption crops or animal-feed. Both are often needed.

I'm just saying that the whole issue is incredibly complex. Nobody has it figured out. You can argue from a morality standpoint, that is fine, but I'm not buying the environmental argument. Perhaps the numbers can be argued. Maybe we do eat a bit too much meat as Americans, but to call for the wholesale abandonment of livestock is foolish in theory and in practice."

Think about that. The first thing the EPA established was the Clean Water Act, which now we want to undo because it‚Äôs too much of a burden for businesses to follow (to not poison the fish and people around them).

But there are a lot of other conservatives that just want to open up different places for drilling and logging and stuff. That‚Äôs something I‚Äôm against in general (especially since we‚Äôre getting passed by literally every other first world country on the planet in terms of producing clean energy), but it‚Äôs not something that is a totally thoughtless policy position either (like dismantling all environmental protection is).

5407,"We already know Lake Erie (and since 80&amp;#37; of Lake Ontario is ""from"" Erie) is a cespool. Lake Huron is set to be a nuclear waste dump. Michigan &amp; Superior (yuk).

The amount of industry that pollutes (agrictulure being #1) will not stop. Combine this with land-use/rights debates with Indigenous populations, and you have a political stalemate.

While NO Environmental action is extremely damaging, throwing resources at failed and mismanaged projects is also equally dangerous.

It was a much needed wakeup call, not only for the US but for the world, as few if any industrialized nations had done **anything** about their own problems with pollution at the time.

Even locally, I often see hypocrites from the Akron area who bitch about Cleveland yet hide the fact that their city was as bad an environmental disaster at the time of the ""seminal"" event. (edit, and point of note, since the Cuyahoga flows through Akron before it gets to Cleveland, contributed it's own industrial effluents to the cocktail that ignited on multiple occasions and polluted Lake Erie.)

TG the fire spurred President Nixon and congress to establish the EPA and begin the process not only of cleaning up the damage but enacting laws to require more responsible energy and mfg production.

The boomers inherited an expensive mess and they cleaned it all up. It was expensive to do, and more so in that they couldn't keep just shoving their pollution onto society. Dumping your industrial waste in the ocean is cheap, treating it is not. They both treated their waste and cleaned up the waste that had been dumped by the prior generation, all the while maintaining an unrealistic standard of living and sharing that standard with more minorities.

It took some slight of hand. Some costs were pushed out via unfunded pensions and deficit spending. Declines in living standards were forestalled via offshoring jobs, making product immediately cheap but the loss of jobs would bite us later.

That is indeed an argument a marketist would make.  

Modern people are far freer to move to another city (while keeping the same job) than to quit their jobs.  But it is true that states are less easy to leave, and that moving to another country is legitimately onerous.

&gt; No.

Your source cites environmental abuses by a *totalitarian government* as typifying those of state activity.  That's a ludicrous straw man, whereas extreme pollution *does* typify unregulated heavy industry.

Owning the land makes no difference about whether or not it's polluted - industry pollutes land with impunity when allowed to, then just abandons it rather than paying the cost of cleanup (if permitted to), and the pollution leaches beyond their property into neighboring properties and municipal water tables.

People's children die of cancer from this shit and then they're offered calculated settlements that add up to a minuscule fraction of the profits the company made on the pollution.  **They kill people**, knowingly, and then throw a few coins at their families from their royal horses as they pass.

And they only do *that* much because of environmental laws.  If the government just completely got out of their way, open sewers of toxic waste would be flowing into playgrounds and the business in child-sized coffins would be booming (something marketists would call *job creation*).

&gt; If a private firm owned Lake Erie, for example, then anyone dumping garbage in the lake would be promptly sued in the courts

Except that company itself, which would use it for a dumping ground and sell the right to dump in it, and simply deny access to it for the general public so that they don't get sued for the resulting cancers.  But of course their pollution wouldn't *stay* in Lake Erie, so they would hurt people anyway, and get sued anyway, but the wealth of someone who owns Lake Erie would be so massive that people would have no real choice but to settle, as described above.

There are so many things wrong with that essay right off the bat.  It would take an entirely new post to thoroughly debunk it."

Mayflies have long tails and are significantly longer, and are only around for a very brief period in the summer. They would not be confused for mosquitoes.

Adding to the confusion, ‚Äúmidge‚Äù also applies to a ton of other insects, including no-see-ums and other biting bugs, who are all part of the same general family. But the midges we get near Lake Erie don‚Äôt bite at all. The biggest impact is annoyance and that their poop can discolor surfaces.

5435,"It took a few minutes to dig up, but as I suspected it's the *dying* algae that produces the methane, not the living ones.

https://eos.org/articles/algae-blooms-and-gas-wells-drive-lake-erie-methane-emissions

&gt; Kilogram for kilogram, the powerful greenhouse gas methane drives atmospheric heating about 34 times more strongly than carbon dioxide does. In Lake Erie, recurring algae blooms‚Äîlike the one that left the city of Toledo without safe drinking water for 2 days in 2014‚Äîproduce the bulk of the lake‚Äôs methane emissions, according to Townsend-Small.

&gt; The cause is algal decomposition. ‚ÄúAfter the algae die, they sink to the bottom, and the algae‚Äôs carbon is consumed through respiration by fish and other organisms using oxygen, so oxygen gets depleted,‚Äù she explained. The resulting oxygen-poor environment favors methane-producing microbes in the sediment at the lake‚Äôs bottom.

Algal blooms like this due to runoff are the cause of anoxic zones, they're just toxic to everything in so many ways. It's like an ecosystem version of cancer, of increased unregulated growth. 

The runoff gives the algae an almost unlimited food source so they grow to dominate the environment and take it over, there aren't enough animals to feed on it to slow or stop the growth. The algae expands to fill the limits of it's food source, which is pretty much the whole ecosystem, then it finally dies when it runs out of food. By the time it dies it's consumed all the oxygen, and as it rots it emits methane. 

Thus you have what was one a thriving ecosystem is now a nutrient and oxygen-free dead zone that not only emits methane but kills anything else that wanders into it. 

If we were deliberately trying to design something more devastating as some form of weapon I really don't think we could."
5436,"I'd like to see Toronto become Futoronto, where the mayor announces plans to do away with democracy and have it run as a technofeudalistic empire with Silicon Valley at the reigns.

They'd close down roads for public use and only allow automated vehicles. They'd give everyone a cryptocurrency-based basic income, and build a Futuronto 2.0 on Lake Erie just south of Windsor. Futuronto 2.0 would just be a large 100 km^2 cement platform for mobile smart homes, smart drones, and modular 3d printed buildings that will be overlaid with mixed reality. They'd let anyone on the planet move in for free and give them a self-driving smart home and basic income and over a few years they'd just slowly expand the surface area of the modular city until it holds all 8 billion humans as they prepare for the impending transcension of hyperhumanity into the technological singularity."

In the Los Angeles area alone, 10 metric tons of plastic fragments‚Äîlike grocery bags, straws and soda bottles‚Äîare carried into the Pacific Ocean every day.

50 percent of the plastic usa uses, are used just once and thrown away.

usa currently recover only five percent of the plastics  produced.

The average American throws away approximately **185 pounds** of plastic per year.

Plastic accounts for around 10 percent of the total waste usa generates.

The production of plastic uses around eight percent of the world's oil production (bioplastics are not a good solution as they require food source crops).

Americans throw away 35 billion plastic water bottles every year (source: Brita)

Plastic in the ocean breaks down into such small segments that pieces of plastic from a one liter bottle could end up on every mile of beach throughout the world.



The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is located in the North Pacific Gyre off the coast of **California** and is the** largest ocean garbage site in the world**. This floating mass of plastic is twice the size of Texas, with plastic pieces outnumbering **sea life six to one**.



In samples collected in Lake Erie, 85 percent of the plastic particles were smaller than two-tenths of an inch, and much of that was microscopic. Researchers found 1,500 and 1.7 million of these particles per square mile.

Plastic chemicals can be absorbed by the body‚Äî93 percent of Americans age six or older test positive for BPA (a plastic chemical).

Some of these compounds found in plastic have been found to alter hormones or have other potential human health effects.

Most other lakes are formed by dams, hills and mountains forming canyons (which humans often enjoy damming anyway), valleys, or low rainfall leading to the formation of endoheric basins.

EDIT: Oh! And remember that because they _are_ river-fed holes, making them a little more dendridic in structure could help improve their shape.

Near where i grew up, an enormous swathe of southwestern ontario was all drained, you can tell because nearly all the far fields have extensive tile drainage systems. there were huge areas of wetland there. I believe there was an almost state-sized swamp complex southwest of the corner of lake Erie too. wetlands  littered  our area, and given how important they are for water retention, storm surge protection, and wildlife habitat, it‚Äôs really sad to see so many gone in the short span of history since european settlement.

Statement:

&gt;News Releases from Region 05.Brownfields Program helps return blighted properties to productive reuse.

&gt; CHICAGO - U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has selected two communities in Ohio for Brownfields environmental Assessment, Revolving Loan Fund, and Cleanup grants.

&gt; The grants totaling $900,000 will provide communities with funding to assess, clean up and redevelop underutilized properties while protecting public health and the environment.

&gt; ""EPA's Brownfields Program expands the ability of communities to recycle vacant and abandoned properties for new, productive reuses, using existing infrastructure,"" said EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt.

&gt; ""These grants leverage other public and private investments, and improve local economies through property cleanup and redevelopment.""

&gt; ""Clearly there is no shortage of creativity, innovation and ingenuity when it comes to brownfields redevelopment projects in the great State of Ohio,"" said EPA Region 5 Administrator Cathy Stepp.

&gt; ""EPA looks forward to expanding our work with our partners to redevelop brownfields so they can once again be thriving parts of their communities - spurring local economies with jobs and new businesses as well as generating tax revenues and spending.""

&gt; Lockland: The Village of Lockland will receive a $300,000 Brownfield assessment grant to investigate potential contamination as a first step in the process of redeveloping abandoned properties.

&gt; The Village plans to bring new shopping options to Lockland's residents who currently lack a nearby grocery store or restaurant.

&gt; Properties to be investigated for potential soil and groundwater contamination include a former shingle factory and a bulk petroleum storage facility.

&gt; Toledo: The city of Toledo will use its $600,000 Brownfield grant to investigate potentially contaminated lands along Swan Creek, the Ottawa and Maumee Rivers, and the mouth of Lake Erie.

&gt; This is the city's 23rd Brownfield grant, previous grants have generated more than $50 million in property cleanups and redevelopment.

&gt; ""On behalf of the Village of Lockland we are both honored and very appreciative of the announcement that we have received the U.S. EPA Assessment Grant,"" said Village of Lockland Mayor Mark Mason Sr. ""This grant will certainly help us make great strides in the villages continuing economic development efforts in bringing in new businesses into the Village of Lockland.""

&gt; ""Toledo is fortunate to have a such a strong partnership with the U.S. EPA and much of Toledo's Brownfield Redevelopment success can be directly related to that relationship,"" Toledo Mayor Wade Kapszukiewicz said.

&gt; ""This $600,000 grant for environmental assessments is a great win for the people of Toledo. The U.S. EPA's Brownfield programs have played an integral role in the city's economic development and reclaiming land. Every area of our city has benefited from U.S. EPA assistance and we need more of these kinds of programs in the United States.""

&gt; ""This will be the 20th grant from U.S. EPA to the city of Toledo over the 20-year history of the Brownfield Program and that is an amazing testament to the partnership between the city and the federal agency,"" said Toledo Commissioner of Economic and Business Development Bill Burkett.

&gt; ""We are fortunate to have coalition partners like the Toledo-Lucas County Port Authority and the Lucas County Land Bank, who work with us to find solutions for redevelopment.""

5491,"Mainly, my focus is on countering Pruitt's rampage through the EPA. 

I grew up in Summit County. My favorite place in our state, the Gorge Metro Park in Cuyahoga Falls, has a beautiful river, the Cuyahoga, running through it, and over the gorge.

Before the EPA was formed, NE Ohio's proud, wandering river was a dumping ground for corporations. Hundreds of tons of waste were dropped into our river. A study of the river concluded that ""life [does] not exist"" anywhere on it's banks or beneath it's waters. It was so polluted that the river itself caught on fire *almost 20 times*. The last fire, in 1969, was one of the major events that led to the formation of the federal EPA. It took a while, but life returned and our river healed, mostly.

Today, there are roughly 200 corporations permitted to dump waste into the Cuyahoga, despite the river being the main source of Akron's drinking water during the summers. We need a governor who will declare a state of emergency over the toxic algae blooms in Lake Erie, a governor who will strengthen our environmental protections and ensure that our state remains as beautiful and as clean as it can be."

5493,"You can always tell a completely useless article on this subject when it ignore the environmental issues.  The generation before the boomers WAS prosperous, but largely because it was willing to rape the environment to get there.  We used to strip mine and clear cut.  Lake Erie routinely caught on fire.  The air in LA was dark brown.

It was the boomers who A)stopped it and B) cleaned it up.  This made everything more expensive, as raw materials were obtained more sustainably and without harming the environment, and the cleanups cost trillions.

In the face of all of these extra costs, the public demanded living standards increase.  So freeways were made safer, cars were made safer (boomers grew up with no airbags, for example), products in general were made safer, and we still had huge demands to increase living standards.  Two cars instead of one, larger homes, etc.

So boomers did what they had to do to deal with those costs.  Mostly, they pushed them out.  Instead of the public paying for your university and making it back up in higher tax money, we made people borrow it and pay it back later.  They kept public salaries low by the promise of pensions, to be paid later.  Taxes were not raised to cover government spending, instead borrowing was used.

No one was going to accept that you couldn't pay for trillions of dollars of environmental costs and not have a higher standard of living.  So here we are.  It's getting harder and harder to push the costs out further, so you're starting to see strains in the system."

5502,"When I was 4 or 5 my parents had a cottage on lake Erie, and me and cousins (huge Irish family, there were a lot of us), would go swimming in groups of 8 or 10. I remember one time, before I knew how to properly swim, I was testing how far out I could go, until I was just reaching my toes to try to touch the bottom and keep my mouth above water, staying as still as I could so as not to lose my footing. I couldn't get anyone of my family's attention, and I was starting to lose my footing in the sand. Right before my head went under a cousin came and grabbed my hand and pulled me in. I'm confident she didn't think anything of it, we didn't say anything about it at the time. Later that day I remember telling my siblings that I almost drowned, but they told me they didn't see any of the signs they saw on TV when people are drowning, flailing about and screaming and such.

5503,"I was doing an independent project for my AP environmental science class that involved collecting water samples from Lake Erie in both the winter and the spring and then comparing the levels of pollution in them at different seasons. At one of spots I stopped at to collect water during the winter, the water was frozen in a way that I couldn't tell if I was walking on snowy sand or on frozen ice. As a result, I had gone pretty far out of the ice without realizing and the ice broke. I fell through and completely submerged. I got very lucky and popped up right where the hole I had fallen through was. I also go very lucky and was able to quickly pull myself out of the water without the ice breaking again. I was alone at the time (my mom was waiting in the car), and I easily could have drowned or frozen to death had the circumstances been slightly different. "

5515,"If you went back 35 years I would agree with the Great Lakes bit but certainly not now

Edit: By the 1960s, Lake Erie had become sort of a ""poster child"" for water pollution. Pollutants from factories, waste from city sewers, and fertilizer and pesticides from farms made their way to the lake, according to Cleveland Historical. As a result, levels of phosphorus and nitrogen increased, which led to algae blooms. The toxic algae caused ""dead zones"" by depleting the oxygen, and dead fish littered the shoreline."

The rivers in the major cities of the Great Lakes caught on fire many times in the 20th century. I found over twenty references to the Cuyahoga burning when I was researching it. Same thing happened in Chicago, Duluth, Milwaukee, Detroit, Buffalo, Toledo...

Way back when, in the dark ages, when petroleum refining was in its toddlerhood, the Powers That Be didn't know what to do with that dangerous ""light ends"" stuff - things we now call gasoline and aviation fuels (among several others). In Cleveland, at Rockafeller's first refinery, kids as young as five years old were paid a penny a bucket to carry the stuff from the tanks to the river, where it was just tossed in (well, it goes ""away!"").

Flammable fuel, add a commercial waterway in an urban setting and you have instant *FOOM*.

There were some odd flames that might flash out to Lake Erie, but I found no records that the Lake burned. It WAS, however, very polluted and nearly died (as in NO fish), but between the EPA, the Coast Guard and some draconian state laws that hammered pollutors, the lake is MUCH cleaner now.

Trump basically wants our waterways to burn again."
5520,"I don't believe your statement is accurate. The lake currently traps 47% of the sediment pollution flowing downstream. If it were converted to a stream again that sediment would flow downstream and a percent of it would go into the Chesapeake Bay. Virginia DEQ concurs with this in the current draft TMDL for Accotink Creek. On page 3-37 of the draft report it says:
 
‚ÄúThis 39% reduction from baseline conditions is lower than the reductions necessary for Long Branch and Upper Accotink Creek due to the 47% trapping efficiency of Lake Accotink that was discussed in Section 3.4.7. TMDL allocations in Chapter 4 are based on these assumptions. While the TMDL does not prescribe that the Lake will be maintained exactly as has been done in the past, it does assume that there will be an average sediment removal of 47% provided by dredging, or an equivalent management practice‚Äù"
5521,"Ok, so a few questions:

When you say ""Lake Accotink Dam has significantly surpassed its useful life"" do you mean in reference to the material condition of the dam acting as a dam or because it was intended to create a reservoir for Ft Belvoir and no longer serves that purpose?  And when you say ""would be better financially, environmentally"" does that take into consideration that the lake removes 40ish percent of the sediment and even if they remove it the County would be on the hook to creat  BMP or BMPs to match that just to be on par  with the pollution removal that is currently ""baked into""  the draft TMDL? Also, not knowing how long you have been working on the dam, how come they didn't follow the finding of the 1982 study and build a channel to channel the bulk of water and sediment downstream? Thanks."
5522,"&gt; When you say ""Lake Accotink Dam has significantly surpassed its useful life"" do you mean in reference to the material condition of the dam acting as a dam or because it was intended to create a reservoir for Ft Belvoir and no longer serves that purpose? 

Both are true, but I'm talking primarily about the first one. Infrastructure is built with a planned life cycle, but with tight budgets and competing interests, that often lapses until there's a catastrophic failure. Dams built in that era were usually planned to last around 40 years without major rehabilitation.

&gt; And when you say ""would be better financially, environmentally"" does that take into consideration that the lake removes 40ish percent of the sediment and even if they remove it the County would be on the hook to creat BMP or BMPs to match that just to be on par with the pollution removal that is currently ""baked into"" the draft TMDL? 

Yes, the alternative projects which would cover the additional reductions would probably be less expensive and more effective in creating biological uplift than dredging the current facility. Keep in mind that the calculated sediment reduction efficiency is reduced by larger rainfall events. With the weather regime in this area shifting towards sudden thunderstorms dropping much larger amounts of rain in a short period of time, we'll see a greater incidence of storms washing sediment out of the lake and likely reducing the sediment trapping efficiency. The impact of the sediment trapping is really more ""sediment delaying."" When we get hit with big storms, the sediment washes out.

Also, any additional reductions wouldn't be levied on Fairfax County alone. There are several other responsible entities which have land in the Accotink Creek Watershed. Granted, DEQ hasn't yet had to reallocate required reductions for TMDLs, so it's not currently known what they'll do. 

One larger facility with a similar situation is the [Conowingo Dam](https://www.chesapeakebay.net/issues/conowingo_dam). It's near the border between Maryland and Pennsylvania, so it doesn't tell us anything about DEQ, but it has important lessons about the efficacy of pollutant reduction by large dams.

&gt; Also, not knowing how long you have been working on the dam, how come they didn't follow the finding of the 1982 study and build a channel to channel the bulk of water and sediment downstream? 

I don't have an answer for that one, but I will speculate that it's a complicated problem since it's the same way today. People have conflicting ideas of how things should be, and making drastic changes in a landscape that's existed for 40 years(as of 1982) takes a lot of political willpower and dollars. I don't envy the people who will ultimately make this decision. They're going to end up with *someone* mad at them regardless of what they choose."
5523,"IN due time.  MoCo and HoCo started the ball rolling.  Once theres a large enough data set that shows these bans are reducing litter and floatables, it'll catch on.  But you can't make a solid argument on just a couple year' worth of data.  And, the EPA is starting to approve TMDLs for trash/floatables, so that's even more incentive for local governments to pass this type of legislation.

Glyphosate in Runoff Waters and in the Root-Zone: A Review - Nov 2015
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5606642/

&gt; 2 Environmental Fate

&gt; 2.1 Soil Interactions

&gt; Although glyphosate is typically sprayed onto plant foliage, some amount accumulates in the soil through by-spray or being washed off of plant surfaces during precipitation. Once in the soil, glyphosate tightly sorbs to soil particles and especially for soil oxides and hydroxides . This high affinity for soil particles limits glyphosate‚Äôs mobility in the environment, a property considered to be beneficial, since it makes glyphosate somewhat ‚Äúenvironmentally benign‚Äù. Phosphate, present in fertilizers, competes with glyphosate for binding sites of soil micelles. Under most conditions, phosphate is preferentially sorbed, the presence of which may remobilize previously-bound glyphosate

ok, so there's that...

and..

&gt; Glyphosate in soil is degraded by microorganisms

too busy now to dig up studies on glyphosate's effects *on* soil microorganisms (right now), but /r/glyphosate .. I've posted some there..  point: it's broken down by them.. but reduces them too. Even then, per above paragraph, it still binds to the soil 'quite well'..


***

moving forward...

&gt; 2.2 Occurrence in Water

&gt; Although glyphosate has rarely been reported in groundwater, when detected, the concentrations are very low. One study conducted by the EPA over six years found glyphosate in seven groundwater samples out of 27,877 samples tested, with a maximum detected concentration of 1.1 ¬µg¬∑L‚àí1 [79]. For comparison, the maximum contaminant limit (MCL) for glyphosate is 700 ¬µg¬∑L‚àí1 [80].


goes on...

&gt; Glyphosate is conservatively estimated to have an aquatic half-life of 7‚Äì14 days in surface waters [4]. Glyphosate is considered to have low potential for runoff due to its high affinity for soils [12]. Contrary to this conventional wisdom, glyphosate has been detected in surface waters, generally within agricultural ditches near the site of application.

Glyphosate Loss by Runoff and Its Relationship with Phosphorus Fertilization - March 2015  (note, over a year before the above two stores)
https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jf505533r

**Abstract**

The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between glyphosate and phosphate fertilizer application and their contribution to surface water runoff contamination. The study was performed in Aquic Argiudoll soil (Tezanos Pinto series). Four treatments were assessed on three dates of rainfall simulation after fertilizer and herbicide application. The soluble phosphorus in runoff water was determined by a colorimetric method. For the determination of glyphosate and aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA), a method based on fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (FMOC) group derivatization, solid phase extraction (SPE) purification, and ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography‚Äìtandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) was employed. **The application of phosphorus fertilizer resulted in an increased loss of glyphosate by runoff after 1 day of application.** These results suggest the need for further study to understand the interactions and to determine appropriate application timing with the goal of reducing the pollution risk by runoff.

Or rather, climate _is_ weather, just average weather over a period of time. So this arctic cold spell _is_ a part of the 'climate record'. However, simply stopping there and claiming it's evidence against global warming ignores (1) the overall trend is that US winters are getting warmer, and (2) climate change can also make these freeze events more likely as the weakened jet stream's winds in the arctic spill that polar vortex further South.

Extreme weather events are becoming more common and more intense. In fact, lakes no longer freezing over in winter cause more evaporation, which in turn can lead to larger snowfalls and worse winter storms. Lake Erie stopped freezing over in 2006, which produce larger lake-effect snows like the record one just recently in Erie, PA. If it was frozen, it wouldn't have occurred as it did."

After the excessive spread of harmful algal blooms in nearby western Lake Erie came back in 2011 and every year since then, there has been renewed interest in restoring wetlands in the drained Black Swamp area.

5562,"I work outdoors every day for 18 years for my job. From my personnel (unlike many that are only outside walking from work to their cars), I can tell you that the climate IS changing. I live in the mid-west (Michigan) and have seen the summers get warmer and the winters get shorter with less snow. The crops and insects are affected by this as well as migration of birds and our great GREAT lakes‚Ä¶.

Regardless of what ANYONE thinks, it would be ignorant to think the addition billions and billions of people, the pollution we produce coupled with the removal of our forests wouldn‚Äôt make any sort of impact‚Ä¶.here in the Great Lake region, industries used to dump ALL their waste (toxic or not) into the lakes thinking that it would be safe because of their size (dilution was the solution for pollution back them)‚Ä¶well, some rivers literally caught on fire and eventually Lake Erie (by the late 60‚Äôs) was considered a ‚Äòdead‚Äô lake with no fish due to the pollution‚Ä¶multiply this fact over the entire world. Ecosystems are collapsing, the oceans are warming because of this (acidification killing plankton), which then snowballs out to other systems (ie WEATHER).

If you don‚Äôt believe that this ‚Äòcould‚Äô or ‚Äòis‚Äô happening, then wouldn‚Äôt be SMART to produce clean energy and clean waste (ie, biodegrade plastics) for clean air? Clean water? Fertile soil?...Flint Michigan had a water crisis from drink lead tainted water from a river that people eat the fish from? Toxic waste dumps taint ground water, cars and factory emissions belch so much CO2 in the air that the Earth struggles to absorb it due to the declining forests and planktons‚Ä¶.

Its simple math after all‚Ä¶climate change or not, it‚Äôs better to be clean than ‚Äòright‚Äô.

I am not very familiar with the all the details so if someone please correct me, but it looks like Nixon set up a council group in his cabinet and Congress set up what would become the EPA. (dems controlled Congress in 1969) 
&gt;  In the summer of 1969, Nixon established the Environmental Quality Council, which TIME described as ‚Äúa Cabinet-level advisory group designed to coordinate governmental action against environmental decay at all levels, create new proposals to control pollution, and foresee problems.‚Äù Shortly after, Congress passed the Environmental Policy Act of 1969, one element of which was to create a Council on Environmental Policy, ‚Äúempowered to review all federal activities that affect the quality of life and make reports directly to the President,‚Äù per the magazine.

EDIT: Im not a pot head dropout and i am actually in the 10th grade

EDIT: 3:48PM 

**Hey everyone I'm gonna write a somewhat extended response to what I see going on as a student inside ecot. I woke up this morning the news I've been expecting for a couple months now as i'm sure many other of you have. Im a little bit scared of the near future and how things are going to be handled over the next couple weeks or so. I have decided that if ECOT does end up closing down I'm going to start attending a traditional school again something I haven't done for 4 or 5 years.**

**Besides the photo above I just received this in my ECOT inbox.**

&gt;Good afternoon everyone,

&gt;Please see the information attached to this e mail regarding the announcement you saw about ECOT in the I Qity main announcements this morning or anything you have read in the newspaper, heard on the radio or have seen on TV.

&gt;Unfortunately we were not informed about these actions until last evening. As updates are provided to staff members I'll send you updates.

&gt;Mrs. (leaving name blank for privacy)

**It seems that the teachers are just about as in the know with whats going on inside ecot as the rest of us. Which seems really off considering the teachers are sort of the ones who are really running the show. I will say that the people we should be targeting are the politicians on the both ECOT and Government sides who have let this escalate to the point where it is.**

**Anyways, the email content a .pdf that stated the following:**

&gt;What does the recent announcement mean?

&gt;We have not been dropped by our sponsor. Suspension means that we temporarily have to stop educating students until issues of concern to the sponsor can be addressed. At this time, we are appealing the potential suspension.

**This sort of addresses the situation a bit more, but it seems like they are ignoring this suspension as I was able to access all of my classes today and complete assignments.**

&gt;When are you closing?

&gt;ECOT could suspend operations as early as the end of day January 19th but we have the ability to reopen through September 30, 2018 if that were to happen. At this time, we have no set date for suspension of operations due to the appeal in progress.

**This is pretty much confirming that it is entirely possible that ECOT could be done after this month. if we're waiting almost a year to be able to get back into school most students likely would have switched schools and had no intention in returning to ECOT.**

&gt;How can I get my records? 
&gt;If we were to close, records will be distributed to the board office of your local district of residence. A letter will be mailed to your address on file with the address, phone number and projected date for your ability to obtain your files from that office. If you are requesting records now, please have your homeroom teacher request a withdraw form to be sent. Note: ECOT is not working with any outside agency to assist in record access or delivery.

**If it does go downhill we will still get our grades and will be easily able to transition them to our next school. Standard stuff of course.**

&gt;Will I get my test scores?
&gt; If test scores are delivered to ECOT, they will be forwarded to the board office where your cumulative files were sent previously.

**Overall, its not 100% yet but this is looking to be the end of days for ECOT considering every single motion they have called on trial has been denied (by a matter of LAW vapes) So assuming that they follow the trend of constant denial by the state and board this is honestly it fellas.**"
5570,"Lake Erie is still a target for fracking. Kasich blocked it in the lake in 2012, but this order would probably over ride that. "
5571,"The actual, or ""true"" sea levels are very very hard to determine reliably. Last Year's ""New Scientist"" had a big article about this, stating very clearly, that in European ports they'd vary by as much as 1/2 to 1 meter!!!!  The problems are quite clear and as have written about a number of times. Determining a few inches of sea level rise over time, is thus largely preposterous, too.

First, what is the solid, benchmark standard for determining sea level?  Answer?  There isn't ANY. The reasons for this are the tides, which can ebb and flow in a complex system manner because the moon and sun's alignments which determine tides are very complicated.

Next, there is NO sea level possible on an absolute scale. They are always relative and comparative, which means there is no absolute sea level possible.

Then, as a matter of fact the tides can be measured within a single tidal basin and embayment, but due to the changing heights of the tides, those will vary greatly. Storms and swells, esp. in winter can change the tides substantially as anyone who's been to Hawaii in the winters can see. The beach can be 20-30 above sea level and 15 minutes later, the waves can be lapping at the beach . We found this in many places in Kauai, where at the Westin the ocean depth about 50' out was shin height and about 10' later we'd be off the bottom paddling for shore because of the swells.  1 person had drowned the previous week due to those swells, right at that beach!!! That's quite frankly 3 m. of variation in sea level as well.

next, the embayment and harbour shapes CAN and DO affect the heights of the tides, as anyone in the Bay of Fundy knows. And wide bays where there are currents it also occurs.

And not last but surely importantly, the earth is a spinning oblate spheroid. Visualize this: oceans will and do bulge at the equator which is spinning a LOT faster, than say at 40 deg. N. latitude. And this means the oceans bulge much much more at the equator than they do at higher latitudes. So sea level varies according to this factor too.

Combining all of these variations, it means that sea level determination being a complex system, cannot have a simple, common, universal value at all.

Thus the problems of ""rising sea levels"" CANNOT even be determined within 1/2-1 m. accuracy in the European harbours, either, be it Atlantic or Mediterranean. The latter has in addition tidal seiches where the sea level will rock north to south, or east to west with the winds, as is often seen in the Great Lakes, as well. That greatly confounds sea level determinations as well.

So, frankly, sea level determinations are about as predictable as the  weather, are complex system and thus have NO absolute values, either, except being more local than anything and surely NOT universal.

Those are the known problems, and given the interaction of all of those complex system parts, anything more than a general probability is highly likely to be out of the question.

Thus, sea level determinations, which are also dependent upon rising shores when glacial ice has melted off, as affects Lake Erie (&amp; the UK), which is still rebounding from glacial ice, steadily, yearly rising in the northern shores and dumping more and more water onto the southern, Ohio shores, as well. That has meant that the I-90 road had to be diverted well inland, because it was often flooding in Cuyahoga Co, the Cleveland area, which am well acquainted with. Plus with storms, the entire 6 lane interstate often had to be closed for days, before it was rebuilt quite some ways south of the shores.

This explains largely why sea level determinations are WAY too inaccurate and fluctuating even under the best of measuring conditions, because those are complex systems, and the variations, like the weather, completely cover up any man made or natural ""averages"" or effects."

Florida just wanted some more sweet, sweet coastline to watch sink beneath hurricanes and global warming. Also they needed some more ports.

Oklahoma wanted the sea, so thought Monterrey was looking nice. Only one set of state laws makes building stuff like highways and high speed trains and canals more simple.

Texas wanted the fracking fields in North Dakota, and thought it'd be easier to build pipelines if they only had 1 state law set to deal with. 

West Virginia wanted access to the sea via Lake Erie.

5595,"Just as the weight of 2 mile high glaciers on the land forms in the Great lakes region is also causing quakes. As the glaciers melted off, the land began to rise. 

In Antarctica because of the high and heavy glaciers there, much of the land is below sea level, which if not glaciated would create a significant change in the sea/land area of the earth.  Once that land rebounded above current sea level.

And as the lands in the Lake Erie area rebounds due to the removal and melting of the glacial weights, the land is rising up on the north side and dumping the water on Cleveland.
