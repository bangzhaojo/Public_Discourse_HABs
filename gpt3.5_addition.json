        "Danish executive Mads Ryder recently quit his post as chief executive of fine-china manufacturer Lenox Corp., after tiring of international travel restrictions that hampered travel between his company in the U.S. and his family in Europe.\n\nFor U.S. companies that\u00a0rely on seasonal hires or foreign professionals\u00a0like Mr. Ryder, an already tight labor market is being further strained by coronavirus-related immigration backlogs and travel restrictions that prevent employees from coming to the country.\n\nSince he was hired in 2018, Mr. Ryder had been flying back and forth between Lenox\u2019s Bristol, Pa., headquarters and Denmark, where his wife and 23-year-old son live. Last year he received waivers from the U.S. government so he could attend his father\u2019s funeral, a family reunion and his 25th wedding anniversary and return to the U.S. Most Europeans, even those with visas, are banned from entering the country.\n\nBut in March of this year, on another trip home, Mr. Ryder, who holds an O-1 extraordinary ability visa, got stuck in Denmark. The U.S. State Department\u2019s waiver rules had tightened, eliminating an exemption for top executives as part of an effort to discourage travel, and he wasn\u2019t allowed to return. He gave his notice the following month.\n\n\u201cIt was a direct result of tightening the travel-ban criteria,\u201d Mr. Ryder said in an interview. \u201cIf you\u2019re vaccinated and you can present a negative test, I don\u2019t see why you shouldn\u2019t be let back in.\u201d\n\nLenox didn\u2019t respond to requests seeking comment. The exemption for executives was recently reinstated, but after Mr. Ryder had resigned.\nAlthough federal officials\u00a0have eased Covid-19 restriction guidelines, the U.S. still has kept travel bans on 33 countries, including the U.K., much of Europe, China and India. Citizens of those countries for the most part aren\u2019t being granted work visas even if they are vaccinated or test negative for Covid-19.\nIn countries that aren\u2019t banned, monthslong backlogs at consulates make it difficult for foreign workers to get visas. Of the 223 U.S. consulates that normally process work visas, 160 are currently accepting appointments, the State Department said.\n\nJulie Stufft, who heads visa services for the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Consular Affairs, said most consulates abroad must limit service because of the pandemic, and the government is aware that reduced visa processing and the limited granting of exemptions have caused disruptions. The State Department has prioritized helping American citizens and people applying to immigrate rather than work temporarily.\n\n\u201cA lot of this is wrapped up in maintaining safety in our facilities abroad,\u201d Ms. Stufft said.\n\nThe situation has frustrated workers and businesses who say\u00a0the U.S. must shift its policies\u00a0to recognize vaccinations and widespread Covid-19 testing.\n\n\u201cNo matter what company or employer we\u2019re talking about, if they have to lose this person or this person is stuck overseas, that has a negative impact on their business and on the economy,\u201d said Susan Cohen, a Boston-based immigration lawyer who represented Mr. Ryder.\n\nThe shortage in foreign workers comes as the number of unfilled jobs in the U.S.\u00a0rose to a record 9.3 million positions in April, the Labor Department said last week.\nRegions of the country that are centers for summer recreation but have small populations\u2014such as Wisconsin Dells, Wis., and Cape Cod, Mass.\u2014are normally dependent on foreign labor. Restaurant and resort owners can\u2019t rely on those workers this year, and they have been reducing service despite surging demand from pandemic-weary customers.\n\nSummer camps, which typically hire about 25,000 camp counselors from abroad each year, are increasing camper-to-counselor ratios, reducing the number of campers and, in some cases, closing altogether, camp owners and industry officials said. The Labor Department has said the accommodation and food-service industries had 1.3 million vacant positions in April, along with 248,000 in arts, entertainment and recreation.\n\nCedar Point, an amusement park in northern Ohio with some of the country\u2019s tallest roller coasters, has been closing two days a week because of the worker shortage, said Richard Zimmerman, chief executive of the park\u2019s parent, Cedar Fair Entertainment Co. The park usually sponsors about 1,500 foreign college students to staff its rides and concession stands each summer, but it has gotten only a few hundred foreigners this year, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the most challenging labor market I think I\u2019ve seen in the last 20 years,\u201d Mr. Zimmerman said.\n\nThe Lake Erie region where the park is located has a year-round population of about 115,000 people but attracts about 11 million visitors each year, said Larry Fletcher, president of Lake Erie Shores &amp; Islands, a marketing organization. The vast majority of those visitors come during the summer.\n\nCedar Fair also normally relies on U.S. college students, but they have been tougher to hire, Mr. Zimmerman said, despite the company\u2019s raising wages by a few dollars to $20 an hour. Besides, he said, American students typically can\u2019t work at either end of the season, when foreign college students with different summer break schedules would usually fill in.\n\nGreg Dugal, director of government affairs at Hospitality Maine, which represents businesses along Maine\u2019s coastline, said in more-remote areas, foreign workers would normally make up 50% to 60% of the workforce.\n\n\u201cIn some of these places, even if every man, woman and child came to the pump, it still wouldn\u2019t be enough,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are fighting over each other\u2019s employees.\u201d\n \nThe Biden administration allowed\u00a0a Trump-era ban on work visas to expire\u00a0March 31. Trump administration officials said the ban was intended to\u00a0safeguard jobs for unemployed Americans\u00a0as the economy sputtered because of lockdowns designed to contain the pandemic.\n\nBut the ban\u2019s expiration hasn\u2019t made much of a practical difference.\n\nIn 2019, about 108,000 foreign college students came to the U.S. through the J-1 summer work-travel program, according to State Department data. In 2020, fewer than 5,000 college students came through the J-1 program. The State Department declined to provide data for this year. People working in the recreation industry say the number is on track to be even lower than in 2020.\n\nCitizens of banned countries can enter the U.S. if they first quarantine for two weeks in a third, nonbanned country, but the State Department won\u2019t issue their visas unless they qualify for a narrow set of exemptions, such as healthcare workers.\n\nMiriam Abrahams, a New York-based cinematographer who produces TV commercials, returned to the U.K. with one suitcase in March 2020 to renew her work visa.\n\nThat month, the U.S. issued its travel ban on the U.K., and Ms. Abrahams\u2019s visa appointment got canceled. Now she is eligible only if she finds a consulate in another country, like South Korea, with an open appointment.\n\n\u201cAll my video equipment, camera equipment, clients\u2014everything is in the U.S.,\u201d she said. \u201cI haven\u2019t been able to work.\u201d",

        "&gt;This is incorrect. Again I'll link the Wikipedia articles on tax incidence and land value tax which explain why a land value tax cannot be passed on to tenants.\n\nI've read those articles, and they don't say what you think they do.\n\nYou cannot have a situation where landlords suddenly have to pay a lot more for something (whether it's tax or anything else) and completely prevent that from passing on in the rent. Landlords simply do not make a lot of profit per unit. The rent has to pay for everything they spend on the unit, maintenance and taxes and landscaping and advertising empty properties and cleaning up and fixing things when tenants move out. It has to pay an income to everyone the landlord hires, and then it has to pay enough of an income to make all the work worth it to the landlord. If you increase the costs significantly, and the landlord cannot raise rents, then the landlord will simply abandon the property. I know people like to think of landlords as having endless money, but that is not the case.\n\n&gt;I would argue that someone like you should pay less in taxes because you aren't occupying valuable space.\n\nThat's nice, but really not. I'm doing fine, and if you remove the tax base from people like me, communities like mine will suffer.\n\n&gt;If the LVT were implemented before they bought that house, then in a sense they wouldn't pay it at all. They could simply invest what they saved by not paying for the capitalized ground rent up front into the stock market and make about the same return as they pay in LVT.\n\nWell, first of all, they still have to pay for the building, and they probably got a mortgage, so while their mortgage might be $30k less (property tax returns are public, that's what the tax people think our lands are worth), the average person wouldn't have $30k to put in the stock market just because their mortgage is less. However, what you're saying is that if someone was able to pay cash for their house, then under LVT they would have the $30k cash left over, and then they would effectively not have to pay taxes at all compared to the current system? How on earth would that be fair?\n\n&gt;I'm not familiar with Cedar Point but a quick google search shows that it's on waterfront property near a small city so I would guess that it's on somewhat valuable land that should not be left as an empty field.\n\nSo, Lake Erie, being one of the largest lakes in the world, except for the lakes right next to it, and being across multiple \"flyover states\" that have very poor areas - well, the short answer is that waterfront property, even next to small cities, is not that valuable here. You will find many empty fields near Lake Erie. The value of cedar point is 100% in the roller coasters that are built on the land. If they had built the roller coasters elsewhere in Ohio, they would have the exact same value. It's not the location, because most people going to cedar point travel hours to get there anyway. It's the roller coasters.\n\n&gt;A reasonable compromise between a property tax and a land value tax is a property tax with an exemption for each residence. So for example if the exemption was $200,000 per residence then a house worth $400,000 on $200,000 plot of land would only pay property tax on the land and half the house, or an apartment building worth $10,000,000 with 100 apartments would only pay the land tax. This would essentially be a land value tax + luxury tax on high value residences and would encourage construction of affordable homes. Under this scheme Cedar Point would pay a higher tax than a field.\n\nHmm. What if I told you that cedar point has actually apartments for hundreds of people because they employ more people than live in Sandusky? Also, if you want to tax landlords more, why did you just come up with a plan that would tax landlords less?\n\nAnyway, the point is that you can't just tax cedar point \"more\" than an empty field, because you're talking about a company with a $1.5  billion a year revenue, to an empty field. The tax rates shouldn't even be remotely comparable. And no, you couldn't use tax incentives to encourage more roller coasters, because gueaga lake and Euclid park and Chippewa lake were all amusement parks more than an hour drive from cedar pointand they all went out of business because cedar point had better roller coasters. There's not room in the market for another large amusement park in northern Ohio, so the tax rates for cedar point shouldn't match anything else here, which would be hard to do if you based the taxes only on land.\n\nI'm giving you specific weird examples that you wouldn't know about to prove one point: that if you try to propose a one-size-fits all tax solution for everywhere, you're going to come up against situations that you didn't think about that work completely different from how you were thinking this tax would work. There's no magic single tax solution that will work across the country and solve all the problems.",

It's all dying or dead already.\n\nThe Everglades are dying from lack of freshwater, and always at risk from development or gas/oil exploration. \n\nLake Okeechobee is completely polluted by Big Sugar and pollutes the waters it empties into. On the east coast, it's the St. Lucie River. On the west coast, it's the Caloosahatchee River. Those surrounding areas on the coasts see fish kills, death of ecosystems and poisonous algae blooms. \n\nRed tide shows up on the Gulf Coast every year from summer to fall, but warm temperatures can see red tide continue into the winter months too. And it stays and lingers in the Gulf because of the lack of circulation (currents) in the Gulf of Mexico in these areas. Like a giant bathtub.\n\nTampa Bay was a success story. It saw regrowth of sea grass after decades of despair. ([https://thew2o.medium.com/a-clean-water-success-story-seagrass-in-tampa-bay-florida-d1a2aec13159](https://thew2o.medium.com/a-clean-water-success-story-seagrass-in-tampa-bay-florida-d1a2aec13159)) But it's not doing all that well in the past couple years.\n\nOne positive story recently was the revitalization of Kings Bay/Crystal River: [https://kingsbayrestorationproject.com/](https://kingsbayrestorationproject.com/)\n\n\\------\n\nThe answers to these major problems are known. Florida's Republican leadership will never commit to solving these problems. This is why I've stopped voting for Republicans completely. The Republican party forced me to the left, back in the day I was a \"centrist\". They forced me to vote exclusively about water. I'm always looking for any politician willing to clean up our waters. \n\n(Also, I found religion after a decade away from the church, which pushed me away from Republicans, but that's another story.)\n\nMajor problems:\n\nUnregulated major development along every beach, every wetland, every lake, ever pond, every river, every puddle, ever retention pond, every stream, every creek, every spring\n\nDumping fertilizers into our waterways. Stop using fertilizer! Just flat out stop buying it or using it.\n\nSpraying herbicides or pesticides near water. Just stop spraying. If weeds are really taking over a waterway, find another method to remove them. Manually remove it. Have an entrepreneurial capitalist come in here and figure out a great manual method to remove weeds choking out a pond or lake. They could make a fortune.\n\nBig Sugar polluting Lake Okeechobee and estuaries on the coast with their agriculture runoff. If you're familiar with Lake Erie up north, they see something similar too ([https://greatlakes.org/campaigns/lake-erie-algae-blooms/](https://greatlakes.org/campaigns/lake-erie-algae-blooms/))\n\nBlocking the freshwater flow of the water from Lake Okeechobee to the Everglades. Everglades needs the freshwater to survive. Everglades was known as the River of Grass ... well, let that \"river\" exist again from Lake O to the Everglades!\n\nSeptic tanks near waterways leaching their actual poop into our waterways. This is a huge issue. ALL houses and businesses near any waterway need to be on city water, so their poop and pee goes to a water cleaning station, not into our waterways. This will take major infrastructure upgrades.\n\nOutdated infrastructure that handles poop and pee, breaking and leaking nastiness into our waterways. This will take major infrastructure upgrades.\n\nRemoving the layers of muck at the bottom of our waterways. When seagrass or plants die, they fall to the bottom and create muck. This muck prevents new growth of plants. Clear waterways turn off colored because the muck doubles as silt in our waters. Silted waters make it hard for seagrass and plants and oysters to grow.\n\nIn general, stop this hyper growth and development killing our waters and green areas. Cap growth. Force developers to help pay for infrastructure upgrades. Infrastructure needs to catch up, and at this point I don't care how it gets done.\n\nFor the rest of my life, I will vote water and vote green. And I'm seeing a growing movement among Floridians to finally recognize our dying environment needs major help. Florida's environment is what makes Florida unique.\n\nEven the most selfish ahole with a multi million dollar estate on the water has to recognize the importance of cleaning up our waterways. You can't enjoy that river you live on if it's toxic from algae blooms. You can't swim or boat in it if it's bad for your health. And you can't sell your house if the waterway it sits on is destroyed.",

        "The Haldimand Proclamation is such a frigging mess lol. Frederick Haldimand, absolute goofball, wrote one of the biggest and most important land grants in Ontario's history and hardly bothered to properly describe the thing. They definitely had much better survey methods back then, but his description (six miles either side of the Grand River) is the property equivalent of waving his hand and saying \"uh yeah that over there all yours.\" Seriously, the thing is like a thirty-second read. This is the whole thing (minus about as much again to say basically \"I'm haldimand, I sign this\")\n\n&gt;Whereas His Majesty having been pleased to direct that, in consideration of the early attachment to his cause manifested by the Mohawk Indians, and of the loss of their settlement which they thereby sustained, that a convenient tract of land, under his protection, should be chosen as a safe and comfortable retreat for them and others of the Six Nations, who have either lost their settlement, of wish to retire from them to the British. I have, at the earnest desire of many of these His Majesty\u2019s faithful allies, purchased a tract of land from the Indians, situated between the lakes Ontario, Erie and Huron, and **I do hereby, in His Majesty\u2019s name, authorize and permit the said Mohawk Nation, and such others of the Six Nations Indians as wish to settle in that quarter, to take possession of and settle upon the banks of the river commonly called Ouse or Grand River, running into Lake Erie, allotting to them, for that purpose, six miles deep from each side of the river, Beginning at Lake Erie and extending in that proportion to the head of said river, which them and their posterity are to enjoy forever.**\n\nLike the guy didn't stop for a minute and think that this vague-ass description, based ENTIRELY on a physical feature *which moves over time,* might be a bad way to grant land to an entire nation of people? They didn't even know where the whole river was! But I digress.\n\n------------------------------\n\nThe point is that it's an absolute mess, and there are about a million questions and arguments to be had about little bits and pieces (many more contentious than the area we live on, Block No. 2). Here are a few important ones:\n\n* Were there any Neutral peoples or descendants remaining at the time of the granting who may have had some claim to the land? (they had been scattered some 100-125 years earlier)\n\n* Did the nearby Mississaugas, from whom the government purchased the land, agree that this was a total transfer of all rights, or did some of them understand it was to be shared land?\n\n* The Government didn't actually own all the land Haldimand described (turns out the river goes further than they thought). So they said 6 Nations cannot have it. The government purchased it later though, and said \"yeah well we said you could have it back then, but we didn't own it back then, so doesn't count, even though we own it now.\" Is this rational? Is this just?\n\n* Exactly what is \"the headwaters\" of the Grand River? How is this defined? Does this point move throughout seasons and due to weather patterns?\n\n* Was the grant intended to be land for use by 6 Nations as an independent, sovereign nation (as was implied their right during the american revolution) or was this as a simple land grand within Britain's colony? (and subject to its rules?) Was Haldimand clear about this? Was he vague? Was this deliberate? Did Joseph Brant (6 nations representative) understand this? Did he clearly communicate this to the other elders?\n\n* Did Haldimand have the authority to make such grants without written permission from the monarch? (some historical law experts bring up points that suggest he did not have this authority)\n\n* Did Brant have the authority to accept these terms on behalf of his people?\n\n* Was the \"straightening\" of the tract's edges, done by Jones in the late 1700s, done with consent of all involved? (not Including Jones' Base Line, which certainly was not).\n\n* Does \"their and their prosperity to enjoy forever\" negate their right to sell the land to others? If not, do these sales negate 6 Nations' rights to enjoy forever land which they have sold ownership rights to? \n\n* Should the six nations have been given the right to sell the land? If they were to be sovereign: is it Just for one nation to sell its land (and residents) to another? If they are not sovereign: was selling in the best interests of their descendants? Would it be infantilizing to grant previous elders anything except total land rights, including to dispose of the land?\n\n* The solution the Government gave was that the 6N could give the government the land back \"in trust\" and that they would sell it to parties selected by 6N on their behalf. Is this legal? (research suggests: not really, but little of this was). Is this fair to the 6N trying to sell the land? If so, is it fair to their descendants?\n\n* Did the 6N sell under duress, understanding that lands were being retroactively removed from their possession, and squatted by white settlers which the government would not remove? Are these sales under duress valid?\n\n* Did Brant have the permission from 6N elders to make all of the agreements that he did with the government? (research suggests not, but its very complicated)\n\n* Are rights to \"enjoy\" the land forever separate from rights of ownership and development? Do indigenous have hunting, fishing rights, etc, on land forever, regardless of it's owner? What is \"Enjoy\"? What limits does this impose? What is \"Settle\"? What limits does this impose?\n\n* The Government did not deliver payment for many of the lands it sold \"in trust\" on behalf of the natives. How can this be resolved? Should the government pay them the 19th century dollar amount? Adjusted for inflation? Adjusted for typical investment, like they often claimed they would do? Adjusted to the current value? (the last one is nearly impossible)\n\nIn any case, the questions are so tangled and messy that it's near impossible to sort out at this point. The only thing we can do is listen to FN groups, and ideally sort out each of these land claims one at a time. Centuries of property abuse are not easily resolved",

I had my act together this morning even if I knew\u2014thanks to an odd, midnight onset episode of insomnia\u2014that something went FUBAR. I go ahead and shave with a damn hat, causing Mrs. Donut to question my sanity, so it\u2019s a damn hat story yer gonna get, you [lousy corksuckers](https://youtu.be/dv8tVxk6Nj4). \r\n\r\nThe Nefarious Z was my soap today and The Socialite gave me a surprise in the shower this morning. No, not that kind of surprise, get your dirty minds back on the sidewalk and I\u2019m *not* dropping in a link to a Boondocks Soap Drop. Don\u2019t go look it up, either. Just. Don\u2019t. \r\n\r\nIt does say lime, gin, *and* ice on the label, and it was like I stuck my head in the ice bucket while mixing my gin and tonic, all while shaving my head. Knowing that, I opted for a cold water shave as I [donned my Reds cap](https://i.imgur.com/NBboyCk.jpg ) and lathered up. As I drug the blade across my poor face, I don\u2019t know if it was feedback or the shrieks of agony as my whiskers met their god-awful fate. Me, personally, I would have rather been the squirrel we almost smashed with the car while driving to church this morning. If my whiskers could only run so fast. \r\n\r\nAlright Bumpuses, here\u2019s your hat story:\r\n\r\nMy late father-in-law, Max, was the quintessential, man\u2019s man. Born in the midst of The Great Depression, he had to work or go without most of his early life. In the process of becoming self-made, he discovered If he couldn\u2019t do things to 110% efficiency and perfection, things just weren\u2019t worth doing, including walleye and perch fishing on Lake Erie. Perfection for him was making sure he was well stocked on whatever color [Erie Dearie](https://www.eriedearie.com/) was hitting that particular day *and* wearing his fishing hat. It was a ratty looking old trucker hat with a fishing slogan on the front panel, but he\u2019d worn it every time he fished. I was fortunate to be able to fish with him on a few occasions and I was with him on that fateful day. \r\n\r\nWe headed out of Port Clinton early and the steady breeze meant we\u2019d be drifting\u2014the captain takes the boat upwind and then we drift downwind in a repeated process passing over located schools of fish. And the line from upwind to downwind is never the same. It\u2019s likely you will never pass the same exact spot twice over the course of six or seven hours of fishing, especially because we would often move between schools of fish or the currents would be different depending on positions relative to the islands. \r\n\r\nEarly on Max turned at the wrong moment into a gust of wind and it snatched his lucky hat right off his head and sent it spinning into the lake. It quickly gained separation and the distance between Max and his hat became greater until it was gone. I\u2019m sure he cussed a blue streak in the moment, but he\u2019d been on that lake enough times to know that some days it takes what it wants and never gives it back. But that hat was special. It had been a gift from his girls and they knew when he wore it, there would always be a fish fry and more than enough for the freezer.\r\n\r\nWe fished the whole day and I won\u2019t tell you any fish stories about limiting out so fast we could feed the 5,000 in earnest. Truth is, the lake was in a transition phase and though the walleye were plentiful, they weren\u2019t biting like they used to. We did had a good time catching what fish we did and I wish I would have had more days on the lake with him. Our Captain was a friend of Max\u2019s, so when he took us out, he always stayed out about a half-hour longer than most others. We decided that we were running the final drift of the day, but we\u2019re probably not going to do much better. As we were ready to reel in and head back to Port Clinton, a piece of flotsam caught my eye. As it came closer\u2026son-of-gun, if it wasn\u2019t Max\u2019s hat. The look of surprise on his face as it neared the boat turned into a mile-wide grin. The \u201cprodigal\u201d hat had returned and we snatched it back out of the hands of the lake. Over the ensuing years, that event was talked about more than any boatload of fish ever caught and that hat now has its rightful place in the annals of my mind.",

        "The article:\n\nWith a vast portion of the United States coping with exceptional drought this summer, conditions are ripe in many places for harmful algal blooms, bringing additional threats to already-stressed water systems and increased health risks for communities.\n\nThe blooms are in large part fueled by phosphorus and nitrogen runoff from industrial agricultural operations, which provide a feast of nutrients for cyanobacteria \u2014 a group of aquatic, photosynthetic bacteria that grow out of control and overwhelm their ecosystems in the presence of excess nutrients.\n\nTo protect humans and animals from potentially lethal effects of the blooms, officials have closed beaches in Wisconsin and temporarily shuttered shellfish harvesting in Florida. Annual blooms in Oregon have contributed to what has become a full-blown water war at the California border.\n\nTo the possible relief of residents living in parts of Ohio, Michigan and Ontario, many of whom have come to intimately know the telltale stench and economic impacts that wash up when a toxic soup of algae blankets the water, scientists with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) have predicted a lower-than-average algal bloom in Lake Erie this year.\n\nBut a growing body of environmental health research links harmful algal blooms across the world to chronic health conditions spurred by microcystin: a kind of cyanobacteria linked to liver failure and increasingly, cancer. Some residents in downstream communities who have lived through past algal bloom-spurred water crises are still bracing for the worst.\n\nAlicia Smith is executive director of The Junction Coalition, a neighborhood organization focused on social, environmental, economic and peace education that formed in response to the Toledo, Ohio, water crisis in 2014, which left 500,000 people without drinking water. \u201cSeven years later we still hold our breath wondering if in July, August and September we will get a notification that we can\u2019t drink, touch or bathe in the water,\u201d Smith told Truthout.\n\nSmith estimates that a majority of community members in her area in Toledo, known as the Junction neighborhood, were not aware of dangerous levels of microcystin in the water at the time. \u201cWe had to get football players and basketball players from our local schools to help canvas and drop off water,\u201d she said.\n\nSince then, in an attempt to avoid another algal bloom-fueled water crisis, a new regional commission has planned to invest in improvements to its water treatment facilities, including a $100 million new water intake system and $70 million water towers, as the Toledo Blade reported. But the cost is being passed off on city residents, whom the Blade estimated would pay double the cost of 2019 water prices by 2025.\n\nFor many Toledo residents, those prices are prompting an affordability crisis, Smith said, noting that residents still worry that water flowing through the tap may be making family members sick.\n\nA Burst in Blooms?\n\nAlgal blooms are nothing new. According to a June article in Nature, Japanese explorers reported \u201cred waters,\u201d known now as \u201cred tides,\u201d as early as the year 731. But agricultural runoff from industrial farms and lawns and a lapse in limits and enforcement around nutrient runoff may be leading to bigger blooms. Research by the United Nations Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission has suggested that the harm caused by blooms strongly correlates with the growth of the aquaculture industry.\n\nThe tame 2021 NOAA prediction for Lake Erie is based in part on lower-than-average March and April rains this year, which brought minimal phosphorus discharge. Hans W. Paerl, a professor at the University of North Carolina Institute of Marine Sciences, told Truthout that, at the end of the day, the NOAA algal bloom forecast is only a prediction. After a dry early spring, May and June ended up bringing higher-than-average rainfall and with it, nutrients, such that if a significant drought were to set in, conditions could change \u2014 though drought conditions in northwest Ohio remain more moderate than much of the rest of the U.S.\n\nThe kind of extremes that the climate crisis brings makes the NOAA\u2019s job a tough one, Paerl said, and means the bloom prediction could swiftly go awry. \u201cIf the water suddenly slows down, well then those nutrients are going to be sitting in the lake, you know, ready to support a bloom.\u201d\n\nThrough Water, Through Air\n\n\u201cOhio has a very chronic problem,\u201d Jiyoung Lee, an environmental health sciences professor at Ohio State University, told Truthout, as does much of the rest of the world.\n\nLee has been studying cancer data in the U.S. and in South Korea for the past 10 years. Together with a wide-ranging team of collaborators, Lee has found that microcystin strongly correlates with increased rates of liver cancer. In a 2020 article, the team compared cancer data from Ohio residents diagnosed with a malignant tumor between 2000 and 2014. They linked those cases to respective census tracts, allowing the team to connect a given person to their drinking water source.\n\nUsing satellite sensing to generate a list of surface water sources with visible cyanobacteria blooms from 2002 to 2011, Lee\u2019s research team found that people whose water came from lakes and rivers impacted by algal blooms had a 17 percent higher incidence of liver cancer in comparison with those estimated to receive groundwater \u2014 a source coming from cooler and darker underground sources where algal blooms are not prevalent. Census tracts estimated to be served by bloom-impacted waters were also linked with higher levels of poverty and more likely to be coded as non-white.\n\nLee says exposure is commonly understood as occurring by sipping contaminated water, eating fish living in impacted ecosystems, or coming in physical contact through recreational activities like swimming or angling.\n\nBut exposure happens in more subtle ways too. Now, Lee is studying how the use of bloom-impacted water to irrigate crops like carrots and lettuce might also be contributing to the incidence of liver disease. The research is particularly pertinent given that 70 percent of freshwater withdrawals around the world go to irrigating agricultural fields, according to the United States Geological Survey. \u201cWe need to look at [exposure] in a more holistic way,\u201d Lee said, noting potential links between other cyanotoxins and neurological conditions like Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nA 2020 review by Paerl found that people might face exposure to toxins in even more passive ways, by inhaling aerosol particles from bloom-impacted sources that drift off of water flowing through household faucets.\n\n\u201cZero Maggots\u201d\n\nWhile there is no one-size-fits-all fix for harmful algal blooms, Paerl said; there are plenty of what he calls \u201cnon-rocket science solutions,\u201d like leaving native vegetation to serve as a buffer between development and waterways rather than carpeting the ground with grass, and ensuring that that septic systems are not leaking into water systems.\n\nMost essential, Paerl said, is reducing the inputs that lead to algal blooms. \u201cThe knob we can tweak is the nutrient knob.\u201d\n\nKristy Meyer is associate director of Freshwater Futures, a nonprofit focused on building political power to promote water democracy and empower residents to protect the Great Lakes. She says the Biden administration should expand which waters qualify as \u201cWaters of the United States\u201d \u2014 those that are protected under the Clean Water Act. In 2020, the Trump administration stripped federal protections for wetlands and streams. \u201cI think of Lake Erie like a heart,\u201d Meyer said. \u201cIf you cut off part of the capillaries, or the arteries, the heart starts to die. That\u2019s basically what we\u2019re doing when we roll back the Waters of the U.S.\u201d\n\nA new, more expansive rule, would allow regulators to set a daily limit on nutrients for smaller water bodies like wetlands and streams, requiring industrial-scale operations like factory or monocrop operations to figure out how to decrease what they\u2019re releasing to a certain level or face consequences. Meyer also suggests that the next iteration of the farm bill, set to expire in 2023, should include provisions requiring agricultural operations receiving federal subsidies to be subject to a nutrient monitoring plan. Existing federal law sidesteps the nutrient runoff problem, as the Associated Press reported in 2017.\n\nIncreased protections are also needed from a public health standpoint, Toledo residents say. According to the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, drinking water is safe for adults so long as it contains less than 1.6 microgram per liter of microcystin. The World Health Organization\u2019s limit is 1 microgram per liter. No health guidelines yet exist in the U.S. spelling out safe levels of microcystin in food, a guideline that researchers like Lee would like to see established.\n\nSmith says health standards that allow for any level of a toxic substance to enter human bodies are not good enough from a justice point of view, given the legacy of health disparities that map onto race and class in the U.S.\n\n\u201cWe always have these wonderful numbers: Five [micrograms per deciliter] of lead is allowed. That\u2019s better than, you know, 15\u2026. But zero is the amount of lead that is safe for consumption,\u201d Smith says.\n\nIn the same sense, Smith contends that no level of microcystin is safe for consumption, and that local, state and federal governments should work toward fully eliminating it, and other toxins, from water and food systems.\n\n\u201cZero maggots is what I want to eat,\u201d Smith said.",

        "If you want to Chicago and Badlands the smart way, spend one night in the city (Club Quarters at Wacker &amp; Michigan is a great little business hotel that\u2019s deserted and cheap on weekends, especially Sunday, and close to everything Downtown) and then at the end of the day (like 8-9pm after the traffic calms down significantly) get a hotel along I-90 outside Janesville or Madison, Wisconsin...then get an early start to Badlands. You\u2019ll have time to stop at the Jolly Green Giant statue in Blue Earth, MN, and Corn Palace in Mitchell, SD to break up the trip and still get to Badlands at about 6-7pm if you get started at dawn. That gives you time to drive around and see stuff a bit before the sun goes down, and probably hike a trail or two.\n\nThe next day, explore Badlands at whatever pace you like. You can hike almost every trail but the big long loop in a day...and do the scenic drive with all the stops. If you get an early start, you will see bighorn sheep out! They\u2019re pretty cool. When you\u2019re done at Badlands, go to Wall Drug and look around at all the oddities, get coffee or dinner or lunch, and then move on to the Black Hills.\n\nThe Black Hills are even better than Badlands! If you want to spend extra time anywhere, this is the place! Mt. Rushmore tops every list of every person who\u2019s never been there, but I don\u2019t even think it\u2019ll crack the top 3-5 attractions there once you\u2019ve seen the Norbeck Hwy (this include The Needles Hwy &amp; Iron Mountain Road\u2014which has awesome views of Rushmore *without* having to pay or wait around for parking), Wildlife Loop Road in Custer State Park, the waterfalls of Spearfish Canyon, and Devils Tower. If you like hiking, try Black Elk Peak...it\u2019s the highest mountain between the Rockies and...well, Europe!\n\nYou could easily fill several days in the Black Hills.\n\nI will warn you that Moab will be insane amounts of hot in July. You may not want to spend as much time as you think here, because this dry heat + altitude will suck the moisture, salt, and *soul* out of your Eastern body (I\u2019m from Ohio, so this is from firsthand experience...*in September...*) and you will very likely not have an easy time even doing the short hike to Delicate Arch and back. Mesa Arch in Canyonlands is slightly higher in elevation and may be a bit cooler, and is definitely a lot shorter hike...and we\u2019ll worth the trip. The Moab area will still be worth seeing on your timeframe, but it might be best for you to spend just one full day seeing things that are not far from your car and then moving on.\n\nTherefore I would recommend that you consider the Rocky Mountains in Colorado. Rocky Mountain Natl Park is fantastic, but Black Canyon of the Gunnison is more off the beaten path and farther from Denver, so it is much less crowded. There are tons of places to see in the national forests throughout the Rockies...so you don\u2019t need to go to the national parks to find spectacular hiking or sights unless you\u2019re trying to cross them off your list. Either way, the elevations are higher and the temperatures are perfect in the Rockies.\n\nOn your way home, I highly recommend stopping for barbecue in Kansas City! The drive across Eastern Colorado and...well, all of Kansas is as dull as they get, but the barbecue is...it\u2019s out of this world! I recommend the original location of Joe\u2019s Kansas City BBQ at Mission &amp; 47th in KC, KS, but I\u2019m going through there this fall and have another barbecue joint picked out because there are literally dozens of them that are probably better than anything you can find outside Kansas City from what I\u2019ve read and been told.\n\nSTL has Gateway Arch if you want to stop at another national park...and you can stop in Casey, Illinois along I-70 to see the absurdly large things they\u2019ve built there. I honestly wouldn\u2019t devote a huge amount of time towards anything East of the Mississippi...it\u2019ll be very similar in a lot of ways to anywhere else in the East.\n\nWhen you visit Cuyahoga Valley, rent bikes in Peninsula and ride the Ohio &amp; Erie Towpath Trail for a few miles. If bicycling isn\u2019t your thing, at least visit Brandywine Falls...there\u2019s a great hike there that starts at the Stanford House. Instead of getting dinner or lunch or what have you in Peninsula though, take the short drive into Cleveland and try the beer, restaurants, and ice cream on W 25th Street. Lots of great breweries and restaurants here, and Mitchell\u2019s Ice Cream is a local favorite with non-dairy options even. The historic West Side Market is worth a look, or even may provide lunch/dinner for you. Before you hop on the road to Chicago, jump on the Shoreway and stop at Edgewater Park to take in a view of Lake Erie and the Cleveland skyline...you can take a picture in front of the Cleveland script sign there. Instead of taking the Ohio Turnpike all the way to Toledo, stay on Route 2 till you get to Port Clinton and enjoy the views of the Sandusky Bay...then head back to the Turnpike/I-90 through Oak Harbor on Route 163 to miss the Toledo traffic. This won\u2019t add much time to your trip, but you\u2019ll at least have a little bit more exciting trip across Northern Ohio than you\u2019d get on the Turnpike. It\u2019s a lot better if you take US-6 along the lakeshore across instead of the freeway, but you really want to spend most of your time past the 100th Meridian (roughly US-83) out West.\n\nAlso, if you come into Chicago at about 8-9pm or so, the traffic is considerably easier to deal with! Chicago is roughly 5 hours from Cleveland, and you gain an hour crossing into the Central Time Zone just before. If you leave CLE around 4-5pm, you should hit everything just right and still have time to grab a late dinner or snack before it gets really late. If you stay near Wacker &amp; Michigan, you can walk down to the bottom next to the Wrigley Bldg to the Billy Goat Tavern. Before the pandemic we\u2019d always stop in there for a cheap burger and a drink...there is a lot of history and interesting people in there...hopefully it\u2019s still there!\n\nHave fun! And know you\u2019re making a good call spending most of a week at Yellowstone &amp; Grand Teton. You should have a fantastic trip with plenty of time to enjoy your stops! We\u2019ve done this in 17 days from Cleveland, so I know for sure that 24 days is going to be a great timeframe for you. If you want more ideas for stops, check out my travel blog, [RealImaginaryLife](https://realimaginary.life), which has maps, itineraries, journals, and plenty of photos from most of our trips out West. It may help you find a few stops to break up long drives. We\u2019ve found a lot of great options for that over the last few years!",

        "I cant define being romantic... but seems to come naturally.   \n\n\nI have about 20 different dishes I can make on a single burner at the park or beach. I've also had various kits for that purpose. All lite dishes, since anything too heavy might be romantic but can the mood for sexy time. Soy sauce infused with garlic, ginger, and spring onions can turn simple into WOW, along with home made onion oil. Show off some knife skills, and general organization... I've cooked date meals at the end of broken peers on lake erie... and on a roof top down town I had access to. One of my step daughters, who is 25 now, employs this too. I used to cook for her mom, and her and her sister, for date night with the kids.  \n\n\nHearts drawn in the steam of windows and mirrors. Random origami creatures. Learn how to make 2 cranes kissing, along with horses. Cute Bento! The heart eggs, along with putting nori eyes on thing apples. I have cutters and punches.   \n\n\nI dont buy jewelry... but when I did as a teenager in the 80s  I put a $125 emerald ring in a cracker jack box. That ex gf is in my camping group, and we re-dated a lot in the 90s and early 00s. She thought it was super cute.  \n\n\nWashing dishes together is romantic.   \n\n\nForwarding things related to their interests is romantic.  \n\n\nBoating/Kayaking is romantic. BONUS if you have a hot meal on the boat at sunset.  \n\n\nCleveland has what are called metroparks, and they kinda connect in a horse shoe. There are a few small rivers. River walking is romantic as hell, and there are great spots to kiss under water falls. Want someone to talk about you forever? Make out under a water fall. There are 2 at Squaw Rock in the cleveland metro parks.   \n\n\nBuilding a camp fire to sit around. Bonus if beach. I taught my step daughters the art of the 1 match fire when they were 6-10.  \n\n\nArboretums and museums. 20 questions/interogation.   \n\n\nTrips to island. We have Peele and Kelly's... But also one take trips... or trips to forbidden areas. Locally we had a place known as helltown, a city that was abandoned. In the 80s and 90s it was a fun date trip.   \n\n\nWhen I was a welder in my early 20s I made crazy art... I made 2 Quetzalcoatl kissing; the base was their tails in the shape of a heart, with them standing arched and kissing again in the same of a heart, one with spiked wings and the other with wings made from a fan cover, with brass welding nozzles as heads, heated and polished in a way that brought out the rainbow effect. (they were not welded to the steal, but stuck as part of filling that area in with metal). It stood easily 2 feet tall. The woman still has it 26 years later... I made some less grand... some more functional. A metal demon kneeling with her hands up in offering with a small bowl. Why? The recipient wanted a new place to burn incense back in the day. It sits in her Piano room.  \n\n\nI've also been told that playing with a woman's kids is romantic. I played a lot of poly pockets, easy bake oven, pumpkin carving with electric carvers (they cant cut skin), and so on...  \n\n\nWrite stupid haikus about your experiences. Only certain people like this.\n\nStar gazing... I've been able to find marz since I was a kid... I remember someone wanted to call me on it using the skymap... and BAM... Mars! \n\nAnd these are the non-sexual romantic things that come to mind.  Honestly to me romance means having fun with your SO/love interest mixed with foreheads pressed together with long gazes into each others eyes here and there, and peppered with kisses, and hand holding. Sharing your thoughts, feelings, while having fun.   \n\n\nI'm not romantic is code for \"I'm fucking boring\" imo.",

        "In this scenario, General Isaac Brock and Tecumseh are still alive in 1813, so the formidable alliance they forged between natives and Britain remains. The US reforms in the Army never materialize or take too long due to petty infighting, so the army is still led by aged Revolutionary officers with little recent experience and the troops are still p/t militia. Harrison, not Tecumseh, is killed in the Battle of the Thames (or Battle of Moraviantown), sending US forces in the Old Northwest into disarray. Brock continues his aggressive tactics stateside with forays into Western New York, capturing Buffalo and has the foresight to build a naval station on Lake Erie. Britain builds a ship of the line on Lake Erie by 1813, which gives Britain naval superiority there. Perry still attempts a naval battle, but instead the British win decisively and dominate Lake Erie allowing for amphibious raids stateside. Lakeside US towns and ports are ablaze, mirroring what happened IRL on the Niagara frontier. Brock, concerned about longer supply lines, gives Tecumseh and the natives free rein to harass American settlements in Michigan territory and Ohio Valley.\n\n1813 is a pivotal year as in this timeline, Napoleon is killed at Leipzig. It is a rout. Coalition allies mop up what remains of the Grande Armee and converge on Paris by the spring. Britain, wanting to settle matters quickly in America, urges allies to keep a standing coalition army in France until 1814. This frees Britain to send reinforcements in 1814 to pursue a punitive campaign in America. Pressure mounts in Washington as frontier congressmen push for negotiations for a truce with Britain, as Detroit and now Buffalo are garrisoned with British troops.\n\nWellington (as IRL) resists efforts to send him to America to lead the invasion, but he relents after a personal appeal by the Prince Regent. On one condition: he is allowed to bring elements of his Army of Portugal with him. Wellington, not Prevost, leads the Plattsburgh campaign. The British navy wins on Lake Champlain and Wellington's army marches south. Events in Washington DC transpire as IRL, except maybe British forces capture President Madison on the run. This becomes a powerful propaganda tool. The White House doesn't burn because Wellington has made it his occupation HQ. Concerned about supply lines, he urges both sides to negotiate for peace, this time insisting on sending first-rate British diplomats to Ghent, who push for uti posseditis -- to keep any conquered territory. These terms remain in the final draft. Wellington leaves for Britain in late 1814, arriving as a war hero. He leaves a garrison in Washington and a naval squadron in Chesapeake Bay as added leverage in negotiations. \n\nAt the Battle of New Orleans, a lucky shot disables Andrew Jackson at a pivotal moment and the British prevail in a close run victory. News of the defeat disheartens the American public, who want the war to be over. Britain captures Maine. Detroit, Buffalo and Washington have British garrisons and in the negotiations, the US cedes Maine (now the \"Province\" of New Ireland, to be later incorporated into a larger New Brunswick in 1816) and the Niagara frontier east of Niagara River but insist on retaining Buffalo. Brock, now Governor-General of the Canadas, insists that Britain honour its promises to Tecumseh and Michigan territory becomes an Indian homeland with Detroit as its capital, but Britain reneges on granting native territory in the Ohio Valley. Britain,  in an act of good faith, returns New Orleans and withdraws from Washington DC and Lake Erie. As IRL, both sides agree to free movement of shipping on the Great Lakes for trade and limited naval presence. Both sides want trade to resume. It is peace at last.\n\nBrock is made a Viscount in 1815 for his defence of Canada and returns to Britain, beginning a long political career in Parliament. Tecumseh dies of natural causes in the 1820's, disrupting the grand alliance of natives as his heirs squabble over the succession and only resolving it via British mediation. American migration westward continues and frontier tensions in the Ohio Valley in the 1830's lead to a negotiated settlement that both Britain and US abide by to avoid conflict. Michigan becomes a \"nation within a nation\" of sorts, a fusion of native and Westminster parliamentary traditions.\n\nMichigan attends the Charlottetown Conference in 1864 as an observer but ultimately declines to join Canadian Confederation. Michigan becomes Canada's 11th province in a sovereignty association situation when Newfoundland (the 10th) joins in 1949.",

        "I'm on mobile so I will tell a somewhat abridged version of this. My NDA expired years ago, so why not? \ud83d\ude04\n\nFor reference, Cap has always been my favorite hero. My friend found the casting ad for extras for a movie called, \"Freezer Burn,\" that was shooting in Cleveland, OH on some forum. Probably reddit, realistically. We live in the dead center of Illinois and I had just lost my job, so we decided to go to the casting. We got pulled over by a nice lady state trooper in Indiana for speeding, but we flirted our way out of a ticket by telling her we we're gonna be movie stars. I believe it was January at the time, and we arrived at a community College campus in Cleveland after an 8 hour drive. The weather was bitter cold, with the wind howling. People were giving up and leaving, mostly due to said wind. I would yell at them, \"What would Captain America do?! What would Cap do?!\" obnoxiously as they left the line. Partially because the line took almost 5 hours to get inside the building and partially because they were being babies and were missing out on what I knew would be a great chance that I didn't want them to miss out on. Once in the building, we filled out a simple form for the third party casting agency, took a headshot with a number held up, and left. Really fast process considering the wait. We drove the 8 hours back home across the northern Ohio and Indiana borders in a blizzard. We arrived home grumpy and tired early in the morning.\n\nI heard nothing for months, started a new job. A week into the new job, I get an email from the casting agency at around 12pm my time saying they needed extras TOMORROW AT 7AM. I freaked out during my training, but instantly sat down, sullen, realizing I couldn't go. I'd just started, had no time off, etc. My trainer looks me dead in the eye and goes, \"Oh fuck that, you're going.\" He called the district manager who okays some wild schedule changes, and I arrange to go with another friend and pay him to drive so I could sleep. My now wife (then girlfriend) packed my bag and my friend picked me up and off we went to Cleveland. The whole trip there I maybe got 15 minutes of sleep from being so excited. \n\nI arrived on set next to Lake Erie across from the Browns stadium and went to the wrong area for parking. Instead of going where I should, I just casually drove past the trailers for all the stars, names on the doors and everything. I was like there is NO way I am on the right spot and I don't want to get shot by some Hollywood elite because I KNOW WHAT THEY DID TO YOU NATALIE WOOD, so I spun around and found the right place to go. I checked in with the extra wrangler and headed off to wardrobe. We had to bring our own costumes based on a loose description of, \"Something young business people or politicians in DC would wear.\" My wife had packed me 3 business suit style outfits and, somewhat jokingly, an ugly brown sweater I hated in case it got cold. The wardrobe person picked the brown sweater for me to wear. \n\nAfter this we gathered in a large white temporary tent like you see at outdoor weddings. I settled in next to some girls at one of the tables and struck up a conversation, and eventually more people joined us. We were very close to the table where the check ins happened, and we overheard everyone checking in. One dude who showed up brought a briefcase with a letter of recommendation from his drama teacher and was insisting he have a speaking line to the lady just trying to get everyone logged in. I didn't even hide how hard I was laughing at him and his foppish attitude. The girls and everyone else that joined started laughing after I repeated what he said. He snootily put his nose in the air and resigned himself to a different table full of us peasants.\n\nAfter a bit, we got in some vans and went up the road to a bridge overpass that we were to run away from as an explosion happened above (1:43 in the first trailer, I am the brown blurred blob on the right running the opposite direction from Scarlett Johansson). This shot took about 6 hours to get right. Scarlett would start running, we would pass her. Scarlett would run, we would run. On 15 hours of sleep, powered by only caffeine, nicotine, and the adrenaline of being on the set of a movie of my favorite hero, I ran. Again and again and again. I made a few more friends with people on set between takes. We would mix up the scene a bit every so often. One guy went from just running to dropping a coffee cup with comical style every time the \"explosion\" would happen. I think this is why they blurred us so hard. We started having too much fun!\n\nAfter breaking for a very late lunch, the shot flipped to the other side of the overpass where we all wore the same costumes. I brought this up to the extra director/on set director (The Russos were on set but they weren't actively in the chair at the time and spent most time I was there not on set. I saw them once for a quarter of a second later in the day). The director told me no one will notice. He was right. I've never seen someone pick apart those scenes online to this day. Haha.\n\nOn the flipped shot, the bus that goes over the overpass was down and the Winter Soldier shoots down from the top at Black Widow. Scarlett did this scene running, ducking behind cars (we would just run away), and then she subbed out with her stunt double for some of the shots of her lower portion. Funny enough, Scarlett shot all of this is bright pink running shoes. Her stunt double had to wear the heels. They also made up large swaths of the choreography as they went, directing both of them at the same time for when they would switch.\n\nWe had a small break (we extras weren't needed for close up shots) at a nearby courtyard across from the Cleveland County courthouse (where inmates being held all watched with amazement from the 2nd floor jail cells with windows), and I made some more friends that I still talk to to this day. I was simultaneously burning to death from the ugly sweater and running while somehow also freezing to death from the windy lakefront day. I just laid in the sun for a bit. I asked the director if I could help with anything else as I don't sit and wait well. He decided to regale us with a story of how when they were filming in DC he snuck his nephew, a Cap fan, on set without an audition and against rules about casting just so he could be in a shot going up an escalator at... I believe it was the Smithsonian or the mall scene. I'm not sure. It's been like 8 years haha. We ate it up, and apparently so did his nephew!\n\nAfter about 2 hours of sitting around, we got to film one more shot that was at the start of the hand to hand bit between Cap and Winter Soldier with a little Black Widow for good measure. We just ran away and none of us are visible, but I got to watch as the stunt doubles did some work and it was magical.\n\nThey called it after about a 17 hour on set day and I went to the hotel and was out like a light.\n\nThe next day we showed up to the tent and it was raining profusely. We did nothing but play card games until lunch. At lunch (courtesy of Marvel, naturally), the stunt doubles joined us at a table at the rear of the tent. The air got tense, as if the characters themselves were there. Eventually, I got up to get food. As I'm returning to my seat, I hear, \"Hey, dude, nice Mass Effect jacket! Where'd you get it?\" I turn around and it's the Falcon's stunt double. He is sitting down at his table and beckons me over. I reply, \"My ex got it for me. Thanks for bringing THAT up.\" He starts laughing at my joke, then pokes the stunt double for Black Widow and says, \"See that jacket? That's from that game I was telling you about.\" She was very disinterested but talked for a bit as well. Eventually the Winter Soldier double and Cap double join in the topic and we have a short conversation about the Mass Effect games. Not too long after I say it was nice to meet them and turn around to go sit back down. Everyone is staring at me. I mean everyone. My table of the cool friendly people... the table of foppish theater kids (there were like 6 surprisingly)... the casting employees... everyone. I slowly walk over to my table and one of the fops grabs me and low key panic whispers, \"WHAT DID THEY SAY TO YOU?!\" I reply that we were just talking about video games. He overdramatically sits in his seat fake gasping like theater kids do when the lunchlady is out of their pudding (or someone at a party doesn't know how to play Wonderwall. God I fucking hate theater kids. That's the real takeaway from this story.) and I go sit back down with the cool kids. They ask me in a less stressful manner what I was approached about and I tell them and they say it's cool and we go back to playing cards.\n\nEventually, the rain let's up and they have a spot for 5 people on set with Chris Evans shooting the same fight scene we left off at yesterday. Only 5 though. They ask whoever was in frame a lot yesterday to not lie and volunteer. I was in frame a lot so I did not go. Not lying here haunts me every day. Hahaha.\n\nAround 5pm, they call it for the rainy day and I didn't get to be a part of anything other than some great times at the tent. I pack it in and head home to Illinois, thrilled just to have been a part of the experience.\n\nWhen the trailer dropped at the Super Bowl the next year and I saw myself, I about cried. I love telling people I was in the Super Bowl. I don't give one fuck about football. \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude04\n\nI'm bad at abridged writing by the way.",

A show about exploring our consciousness, the weird, the eerie, and the beyond. For this episode, Craig, Will, and Adam are joined by Andy (@cainalikehyena), the Black Metal and Industrial maestro behind Ca\u0457na and Ritual Object, to discuss his 'inner experience' of UFOs and of communion with a liminal unknown. As conceptual tools to guide us on our way, we read Carl Jung\u2019s 1959 Text Flying Saucers: A Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Skies as well as Jacques Vall\u00e9e\u2019s work on the cybernetics of the UFO phenomenon as a behavioural \u2018control system\u2019 in his text Dimensions. We also discuss H.G. Wells, Leibniz, Aleister Crowley, Hegel, Whitley Strieber, and the intersection of the early US Labor Movement and alien contact.  \n\n Link's to: \n\nAndy's music: [https://cainaband.bandcamp.com/album/...](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbTVsQndfQVpCWE9RWE5CeW42MjFpRmJhVFhJZ3xBQ3Jtc0tscnQ3c3VSWUZzeXN6bTRhMUlaS1d1eHZDN2R0aFRFSlExOTVrRElIcmxmOTI3UEJYR2xoNzVrVkJLUUl4NW5XcW90ak5hU2c1V2FaUzVmWWJScTBlV0NydnBNeDB2b2wwRmFmR2h5ZWEwWDM4N3BGSQ&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fcainaband.bandcamp.com%2Falbum%2Ftake-me-away-from-all-this-death)\n\n\u200b [https://apocalypticwitchcraft.bandcam...](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbllCbU9ldHBFQXBZR2V6RTJPSVFhQzhWVTNyUXxBQ3Jtc0trMExhR2xsakdVTFFtLVc1QWJBZEtDaDhmSVlhWkZQcS1FVnc1c3l3OThCVGRLUzFRZzV6WHpRend1YjVjaDdKb25nNE9BM3Z2YkdYY3JjQXVoWUZ0LVozUGVxeHV0d1htU3VPZ0VKYXFUWnZJR1ZwOA&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fapocalypticwitchcraft.bandcamp.com%2F)\n\n\u200b [https://ritualobject.bandcamp.com/](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqa1ZUVTRCLVlHZFRTVEplRkFjNnBPT3lfek9DUXxBQ3Jtc0tuZVRUaEVDcmlIR3FJZHpqQmNHek9JWXpSUDhQNXdkNkpnTWREb3pOZExFY2lHZ0dlSzdwQkZxNWthNDlmTkY0UlI2ck5obWtaMmRvaW1PdENFVGE3aURnQllreXhacDJlcW9kMDJnTjRJTGh6Ukx3TQ&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fritualobject.bandcamp.com%2F)\n\n\u200b  Contribute to Acid Horizon: [https://www.patreon.com/acidhorizonpo...](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbHdDeVBqY0dKZzhUblRLUFFRSnZhcDlmeXFKQXxBQ3Jtc0tsWnhIZnR2NWQxMGR1dlZ2OWZoXzYyTFRGVFViM3lVdUdRQ3ZhNXpOWU5aVDh5Qmg1NkpkNkV2UGVtbHNoVldpa0pIUEdPZXJLOTNNQ1dqcjVweEl0RFNnb0FyUVgycE13UkltbEZhVlNDaC01QWJ1dw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.patreon.com%2Facidhorizonpodcast)\n\n\u200b  Subscribe to us on Apple Podcasts: [https://tinyurl.com/169wvvhi](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbktHM2tOZko0d0Z1dkw0eF9SQXYzS25qbFlOUXxBQ3Jtc0tuTEJTemRPY1A3WFcyMERSZGY0TlJORTBmbC04QXZtVzA5TVluLUc4UjVaM0ZOaTkyb3lqdWZ3N3Vvcy1iODhNcXJLdW5mMDN6b08yOXRMeWVOdlJSOXpIeGVnSnV6OHR1MjdCTnlFN1RMaVNTNkc5NA&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Ftinyurl.com%2F169wvvhi)\n\n\u200b   Happy Hour at Hippel's (Adam\u2019s blog): [https://happyhourathippels.wordpress.com](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqazZWUmpVQ0p2allpUWdnQ2ZGOXA5a1o0V0l6UXxBQ3Jtc0tsNG9OY2UtaUk0VEs2NGt6Q1IzM3RTck5PaUlXMVkyR2Jsc3QzbXVhWm1vUm9TWElEUzV0cUFEcTZ6RkVqMzVkN0k1RVgySjBBWnlVb2FYaDZQcXV6dV9ud0cwbmstN25IMHNuaGVOTWpXSFhlOG5DUQ&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fhappyhourathippels.wordpress.com)\n\n\u200b  New Revolts (Matt\u2019s Blog): [https://newrevolts.com/](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbHdqZzhFbmNKVzN5RWxVeDctb0lpR0lXcmIxUXxBQ3Jtc0tuTDVKZ1lqXzU1bDBhcnFxYmwtS0xKUVV1VzdvaUdXaXQ0aHNfcVhhVDRKb2F6X3FiaGQxaTNwbzFXM0ZSazRhV1VFNEZfTzBFcXFNb24tdE9EanVNYm1PdW56OWJPcWxUWU1ZdU1rZzQyeG82MlhvWQ&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fnewrevolts.com%2F)\n\n\u200b  \u200bRevolting Bodies (Will's Blog): [https://revoltingbodies.com](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbTBSU0FHeXl3dDg1ZkR0djE2X3plTWs2TWM5UXxBQ3Jtc0ttZGtfTFFoamZoc2lHQ3JMUFNkVXhHV2U2d1BKNWF0YmJJUkFLWlRWbnNvSXRxQTV0RzhrdnZQc3Zlb1BWcy1iM1pMZmR0cm5DU2JLUDYzOHFIdGZ1Zy1JLU1TU0IxRERpT3djX3QtN3VjOUpmLTlnOA&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Frevoltingbodies.com)\n\n\u200b  \u200bSplit Infinities (Craig\u2019s Substack): [https://splitinfinities.substack.com/](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbDEyak5waFFKYndBTDc5UlV0Sy1pN3hIbnJqd3xBQ3Jtc0tuMENvZUtWUXI2RDBGeE9EVkoydVNwWmFqWEZCX3JiSUpvc1dYQ1BlT3RkbU1LRGFUMFM5YXQ4OXl6ZWdfN29rWFNJYk1RdnBHRS1yTlBJdk5meGxPa2FKTlJrTzBGUVdIUmZzejZiZDIxSHBoRDFuZw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fsplitinfinities.substack.com%2F)\n\n\u200b  \u200bMusic: [https://sereptie.bandcamp.com/](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqa1lFSVpuTi1iN1Y0WFY1RlV1cFlGY2tFRUZiQXxBQ3Jtc0tteWRCUGEwbmoxRkNVUjNnczUwVm9aWVRzOVFLMDUwNjZxbnhQaXIzTmExRlJfdXhJMEFiRWx1YktacFFQVGljTl9mREhEUnJjVWt6alhOV0NFTEttdkdiM1VZQ2tzWXBPdkhzS2RRS3FpajVFZmdndw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fsereptie.bandcamp.com%2F)\n\n\u200b  \u200bMerch Store: [http://www.crit-drip.com](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqblI5cWlOS19YQUJOMWJ2OE9xUG1QTlBBalFnQXxBQ3Jtc0tueGYyR1RhQzN2Y1UtNEpIa3dRYXl2cEpHR2hJckg3a0VmMTl5eUVaS09OV0RtOFJCZXc2cEVDa2VrMDhtMDlXWFdCNVV6ZThrb3lrTFFWMlVLeWhvekpwRmlMNVkwX0pyYUg0eTNFbzEwQWhsUWhJaw&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.crit-drip.com)",

As conceptual tools to guide us on our way, we read Carl Jung\u2019s 1959 Text Flying Saucers: A Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Skies as well as Jacques Vall\u00e9e\u2019s work on the cybernetics of the UFO phenomenon as a behavioural \u2018control system\u2019 in his text Dimensions. We also discuss H.G.

        "Jesse elbowed his buddy *hard* in the ribs causing a deep bone bruise (for both his buddy's ribs and his own elbow).\n \n\"HEY!\" He yelled at full volume, spitting out chunks of his Wendy's Spicy Chicken Sandwich, no tomatoes, \"GET A LOAD OF THIS CHUMP!\" And then he started laughing like the one stupid hyena from The Lion King, but that laugh quickly transformed into a full-throated chortle with a dash, maybe even a big pinch, of cackle.\n \nJay, who's ribs were compressed in from that *hard* elbow drew an imaginary dotted line with his eyes following Jesse's greasy outstretched finger. He needed to cut his nails, badly, and Jay tried to bring this up early in the car on the way to the McDonald's on Fangboner Rd but Jesse just got so angry, so Nic Cage angry, that he ended up hate driving to Wendy's (which was another 6 minute drive in total silence because Jesse had absolutely obliterated his car radio earlier that month rocking out with his cock out too hard in the car (he slammed the radio with his wang and just fucking broke it to pieces (but hey, that's that rock 'n roll lifestyle ya hear about on the news))). Jay saw who Jesse was pointing at. A lonely, pathetic, sad, loser, chump, woeful, limp-weiner guy was just sitting there at the table ALONE dipping an extra flaccid frenchy fry in his vanilla Frosty. Jay shook his head. This guy must be the biggest and most depressing sack of shit in all of Ohio to be eating alone at a restaurant.\n \nJesse sloppily horfed down his Wendy's Spicy Chicken Sandwich, no tomatoes, with BBQ sauce caked onto the corners of his mouth. He shot up out of his chair like a fucking maniac, kicking the chair out behind them and shattering a small child. He pretended to roll up some sleeves he didn't have and marched over to the sad loser eating alone.\n \n\"LOOK AT ME FUCKFACE! I'M FUCKING KING OF THE WENDY'S!!\" He grabbed a fist full of Frosty out of the guy's cup and extruded it through his fingers. He was so hyped up on Spicy Chicken that he couldn't even feel the sliquid coolness of that vanilla Frosty. \"WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT, LOSER? YOU THINK YOU CAN JUST FUCKIN' EAT HERE IN MY FUCKIN' WENDY'S WITHOUT PAYING YOUR RESPECTS FIRST!\" Jesse rammed his hand into his mouth and tongue polished his high school class ring. The purple and white fake diamonds glistened with spicy saliva. Would Fremont Ross High School be proud of Jesse for his actions? Yes, absolutely they would. That's how the Little Giants fuckin' do shit. Fuck Sandusky High School. \"KISS MY RING YOU MISERABLE WRETCH!\"\n \nThat miserable wretch simply wiped his sorry face with one of those light brown napkins which he was so fond of. In fact, the only reason he went to Wendy's was to restack his stash of 'kins. He used them for everything from house cleaning to butt cleaning. A heaving, sweaty, and red-faced Jesse stood over the man. He looked Jesse in his bloodshot eyes and then over to Jay, who was now silently seething with anger in his seat.\n \n\"Doth this foul beast speaketh for thou, as well?\" the man said poetically, raising a single eyebrow, his dominant eyebrow. Jay responded by slowly raising his hand to his chest, clawing into his shirt, and ripping the fucking thing off in one clean jerk. Jay's face was unchanging in its rigid fury. That was a pretty clear \"Yes\"\n \nThe chump sighed. Was he never destined to just sit and enjoy a meal alone? Was it *that* taboo these days? \"So be it...\"\n \nThe worthless dud flopped out of his chair and plopped flat on his back. No matter how confident he ever was, eating alone in a restaurant was just never a good idea, and this time he pushed himself too far. Within moments, Jesse was on top of his tearing him apart with his too-long finger nails. He was like a wild mandrill the way he moved and screamed. And I'm talkin' this guy was really going fucking bonkers here and before you know it, Jay joined in. His savage arms were striking in new and brutal ways that had never before been recorded on camera, that is, until the Wendy's staff whipped out their last generation phones and started recording the onslaught. Well, yeah, it wasn't long before their fryers were revved up enough to join in. They started attacking the squishy body of the chump who surrendered his life to these animals.\n \nWads of hairy skin with globs of yellow fat flew through the air. Blood spurted and squirted every which way. Unidentifiable viscera and gut chunks were strewn about the floor, but the people of the restaurant, the people who would never sink so low as to actually eat alone, those people just would not stop. Gripping it and ripping it was the name of the game and that game was going into quadruple overtime. The patrons of Wendy's had formed a circle around the violence and were cheering on in unbridled joy. One of them even started giving another a hand job. Whoa!\n \nYeah, the chump was dead, and had been for at least twenty minutes now, but these unleashed freakazoids weren't letting up. They turned their sights to a chair. It was just sitting there alone. They went over and fucked the shit out of that chair (non-sexually). What was next? Oh, one Frosty machine? Making Frosty's alone?! NOT IN MY WENDY'S! They fucking tore into that poor machine without hesitation. It squished and sloshed a cry for help, but no one there could understand Frostinese. Anything in that restaurant that stood alone was totally obliterated and a few things were sexually assaulted (not that fist chair though (but a few after, yes)).\n \nThen they looked at each other and noticed that they only had one nose just sitting there all alone on their faces. Well, they took care of that. And then obviously they notice most of them had only one dick dangling all alone at the base of their well-muscled, adrenaline fueled torsos. Those were gone in a fraction of a second.\n \nThis irrational hate and brutal violence for anything not part of a pack continued well into Sandusky (fuck Sandusky High School). \"The Wendy's Loner Haters Mob\" as the newspapers called them later, was shot down and killed by the brave cops at Cedar Point. The resident priest of Cedar Point condemned all their souls to hell. We\u2019d all like to imagine that the damnation took, but I got a feeling those angry folk are still lurking around out there somewhere. It ain\u2019t called Lake Erie for nothing.",

        "First off, 44121 is Cleveland Heights, which is a good suburb. Just be careful more around the border with East Cleveland, which is by far the worst suburb and has the worst neighborhoods in the region. And if you\u2019re familiar at all with Los Angeles, you\u2019ll know that some parts are great, and some parts are extremely dangerous. I would say the worst neighborhoods in Cleveland are *nowhere* near as scary as the places you can find in LA. Cleveland gets a bad rep, but take out the rich parts of Los Angeles and that town is way more dangerous than anything in CLE.\n\nAlso, if you already know or want to learn a building trade, then Cleveland should have plenty of work for you, and with experience you\u2019ll be well over minimum wage. The cost of living here is exceptionally affordable, so you\u2019ll find that while pay is less than SoCal, the cost of living is drastically lower, and you\u2019ll end up with way more disposable income. If you\u2019re looking for cheaper housing to buy, you can find it in some very nice areas like Cleveland\u2019s Kamm\u2019s Corners neighborhood or Berea. North Ridgeville is a little further out, but it also very safe and has very low housing prices. Property crime is an issue in a lot of places, even out in the sticks, all across the country thanks to the opioid epidemic. Some areas of the city and parts of certain lower income suburbs are more likely to get you a smashed window or your car broken into. There is more violent crime (like carjacking and robbery) in some parts, but this is the sort of problem you find in parts of any major US city. In short, yes there are some sketchy areas, but Cleveland gets a way worse rap than it deserves in this regard. It\u2019s way way safer here than a lot of cities across the Southwest, and the law enforcement presence abounds (which you\u2019ll learn very quickly as you rack up a couple of speeding tickets in your first weeks here lol).\n\nAs for diversity, the West Suburbs are predominantly white, but there are more POC in the city and in the East Suburbs. The suburbs south of I -480 and between the Cuyahoga River and I-71 tend to be unwelcoming diversity wise, but the East Suburbs tend to be very diverse, and are polar opposites. One of my best friends just moved to Cuyahoga Falls (a suburb of Akron), which used to have a terrible rep, but he says he\u2019s been more comfortable there than he was up around parts of Cleveland. Ohio really seems to be a mixed bag, depending on what neighborhood or area you\u2019re in if you\u2019re a POC. I don\u2019t know how that compares with SoCal...and I can only go off what my friends say since I\u2019m a white boy who grew up in Southern Lorain County, which is not the most diverse...but also wasn\u2019t the most racist. I mean, the police chief there when I was a kid was black, and highly respected, and the town was on the Underground Railroad. Many of my longtime close friends are also black now, or mixed...and we talk about this stuff sometimes. The city of Cleveland is majority black and a lot of the East Suburbs are very very diverse. But I\u2019ve heard Cleveland is also one of the most segregated...and than even Akron is much less so. So again...it\u2019s a mixed bag.\n\nThe winter weather is something people here just deal with. They clear the roads well after storms, and they salt the roads to deal with ice. They fall behind during heavy storms like we had a day or two ago, but it gets caught up within a few hours after a bad storm, and you hardly notice the little storms. Lake effect snow is a huge thing here though, and while we get a bit of it in the West, the eastern and southern parts of the county get a TON more because of higher elevations and the direction of the winds off Lake Erie. So if you like a little more sunshine and a lot less snow, the West Side or the West Suburbs are the way to go. Some suburbs definitely do a much better job clearing their roads than others, and it\u2019s not always about which has more money. The city of Cleveland is more strapped for cash though, so the plows get to the side streets way later than they do in the burbs. I live in North Olmsted, which is mostly middle income, and they clear and salt the roads here better than much pricier Westlake does, and way way better than Olmsted Falls or North Ridgeville. We do get ice here, but they will salt the roads like crazy before and during the storm, which makes it just scary instead of morbidly terrifying. You\u2019ll find the weather here around the Great Lakes during any time of year to be completely unhinged and unpredictable compared to what you\u2019re used to in SoCal. Having 20 degrees and snow and 70 degrees and sunshine within a single 24 hour period is not all that rare an occurrence, especially in spring. I can remember wearing shorts to school in January a couple of times when I was a kid too...but that\u2019s not typical. \n\nAnd I **completely** dispute any claims that AWD or 4WD is a necessity here. Maybe if you live someplace out in the country it would be nice, but if you\u2019re not going off pavement, the roads are *fine* for a front wheel drive vehicle. The worst part of driving in winter weather is *not* moving, it\u2019s stopping! And all the extra weight does not help with stopping. I got home ok in my little Toyota hatchback and there was an inch of snow on a few roads. Maybe 4WD would have made it a bit less harrowing, but that\u2019s maybe one or two days of the year for me at most that it snows that hard...and I was still fine. I\u2019ve lived here for all my 43 years, half of that in the sticks, and we always got along great with just front wheel drive.\n\nBut you\u2019ll do well here if you\u2019re in the building trades. There are good union shops here that pay very well if you can get in. But I have a lot of friends who make very good livings as remodelers and in non-union shops. Work has been pretty steady for them, even during some of the downturns we\u2019ve had in the past 20 years.",

        "**Full disclosure: I'm white, so I can't speak to much beyond what my PoC friends have said.**\n\nErie's... definitely Erie, for what it's worth. Other people have already said this, but it's a rust belt town, which means it's still struggling to find itself after the major manufacturing places closed down.\n\nI moved to Erie for school in 2013 and I've been here ever since. I live on the northwest side/Bayview in a very residential area, and it's totally chill. Everyone here is really nice and  there are tons of kids who seem to be free-roaming (which is typically a sign of a family-heavy area). I like it better than central Erie, but YMMV. I'm only a mile and a half walk from downtown through some very pretty areas (west sixth), and if you have a car, you can live literally anywhere -- the traffic in Erie is easy to navigate.\n\nA lot of people here will clutch their pearls about crime, but I lived at 13th &amp; French for five years and 10th and East for a year and never had any problems.  My girlfriend and I could walk around downtown and hold hands and no one ever got too weird about it (to be clear, I'm gay) and tbh that area seems to have a fairly high percentage of gay folks. Erie does have an opiate problem (but really, doesn't everywhere?) but I've never seen anyone skagged out on the sidewalk or anything. \n\nErie did have an issue with weekend \"shootings,\" but it was not a shooting *people* problem as it was a *shooting a gun at all* issue. There used to be a club on the east side called \"Energy\" that had a lot of problems with a few attendees who would just like... shoot into the air/into trash cans for some reason. It was a pretty big problem. The owner attempted to control it, but after they got a bunch of complaints, he decided to close down the club because he doesn't want the people who live in that neighborhood stressed out. \n\nBTW: Ghettomart is not nearly as bad as people make it out to be. For years that was my only grocery store, and while it was kinda sketch in 2013, it's basically a bog standard walmart now.\n\nI dunno where you're coming from, but I will alert you that Erie has a pretty notable homeless/transient population, especially in the summer. I do not mind homeless people and often hang out and talk to them, but I know some people can be spooked by this sort of thing. Again, it's not something that is crazy for anyone coming from an actual city. Just don't be surprised to find people sleeping in parks or in bus shelters overnight.\n\nActivities are plentiful when it's not a pandemic outside, but you need to do some real research to find them. I dunno what your interests are, but here's some noteworthy stuff that I've seen and/or attended. This is NOT an exhaustive list and there are probably hundreds of other things you can do\n\n* Several cultural festivals, including Greek, German, Italian, Russian, Polish, Scottish (if you drive to Edinboro), Irish. These are a really great way to score some good food. They also have a pretty young Hispanic festival that I haven't gotten to check out yet, but I hope to see it return in 2021 if Covid is contained! (I also hope that Amerimasala - a multi-cultural festival continues to be a thing, I think they didn't get to do theirs last year because of COVID)\n* Like sports? Erie's got a minor-league baseball team and minor-league hockey team! (There's probably some other stuff, but I don't like sports rofl)\n* Art programs run by the Erie Art Museum\\* (eg: public art lectures, music, drag queen bingo, paint-along nighs), Erie Clay Space (pottery and hand-building classes), Pint &amp; Paint nights at Calamari's and other local bars, public woodworking classes, art festivals, and a budding artsy community starting up around Peach and 26th. \n* A surprising amount of 5/10k/Marathon races, including the Annual Warrior Run (5k), Crossing the Frontier (5k/10k), Presque Isle Half Marathon, ERC's Mother's Day 5k, Race for Recovery, Erie Marathon, Jax Stone 5k/10k walk/run, and waaay more.\n* Celebrate Erie (Erie's big yearly festival)\n* Food festivals, including Rib Fest, Food Truck Fest (which sometimes happens twice a year), and neighborhood block parties (food/drink/music nights\n* Concerts/shows put on by 8 Great Tuesdays, Calmari's (on the deck on Sunday evenings during the summer, iirc), and more\n* Breweries and vineyard sponsored events, including Brew Fest, Microbrew Fest, Wine Fest, Beer on the Bay, Wine on the Lake\n* Season/holiday-based festivals and events including Maple Festival (spring), Maple Taste &amp; Tour (spring), Cherry Fest (Summer), Zoo Boo (fall), \\*\\*Eeriebyss Factory of Terror haunted house (fall), Fall Fest (fall, duh,), Scary Creature Feature (fall), WQLN's craft show (winter), Wurst Party at Peek &amp; Peak (winter), Festival of Trees (winter), Downtown D' Lights (winter), Winter Wonderland (Winter, duh)\n* Presque isle has trails for nature walks, a bike/pedestrian trail for walking/running/riding, beaches for swimming/sunning, bike and bike-cart rentals, playgrounds, TREC (a pretty cool science center I used to teach at,) etc\n* Farmers markets at Perry Square, LEAF (Lake Erie Arboretum at Frontier Park, Little Italy Farmer's Market, and tons of little pop-up produce tents.\n\nAs I said, that's just what I could recall off the top of my head in terms of events/things to do. We also are getting a fair amount of cool shops down in central Erie (Like Ember &amp; Forge (coffee house), Andora's Bubble (boba shop), Oasis Market (produce + locally made goods.)\n\nAs far as your experience in Erie as a minority, I think it's going to be hit or miss and depends on where you go and who you are dealing with. I have a lot of black friends who like Erie, but do gripe that there can be a lot of insensitive people (especially from Millcreek, which is an entirely different problem) who can be kind of shitty and talk down to them. YMMV.\n\nI will say that depending on what you're going to do (eg: go to school) you may want to really research places to live that are nearby if you don't have a car. I'm carless, but I work from home. If you're attending Behrend or Mercyhurst, you need to live somewhere on the 26 bus line (unless you live on campus, which is nearly impossible to do if you go to Behrend, they have barely any student housing). Be careful if you do want to live on the 25 bus route if you go to Behrend because the city keeps trying to nix the Behrend bus there. If you go to Gannon, you'll be able to live downtown and walk, though it can be a little iffy in the winter.\n\nDon't be like me and assume you can deal with bus transfers. My first year I had to wake up at 5:30 am to get to campus by 7:15 am because I had to take the 11 and then the 26 with a 30-minute holdover at the Elm Street Walmart. It ate up all my time and I was extremely sleep deprived. \n\nLastly, have a plan for getting groceries. I pay for Walmart+ and I can get my groceries hand-picked and delivered to me for less than I would be paying to maintain a car or take an uber every time, which makes living in Erie doable. If you have a car, you'll be fine, but without a car, you need to seriously plan for it. Erie is one of the worst food deserts for a city of its size. Seriously, it's really hard to get food in these parts.\n\nSo that's basically all the info I have for you wrt Erie and what it's like.\n\n  \n\\*The Erie Art Museum is legit rad, get a membership even if you're not a terribly \"arty\" person because they do a lot of fun stuff. Seriously. I took my 65-year-old construction worker dad to a topiary/park/landscaping exhibit they have and (unexpectedly) he loved the amount of folk art they have there.\n\n\\*\\* I cannot recommend Eeriebyss enough, its SO GOOD. I took my gf last year and we had a blast.",

        "As the season went along, Watson started to lose faith in the direction of the organization. There were several warning signs in the first few weeks alone: an opening-night loss to the Chiefs that only proved that Houston\u2019s roster overhaul had done nothing to shrink the gap between the two teams. A blowout loss to the Ravens in Week 2. A mid-practice argument between O\u2019Brien and Watt in Week 3. O\u2019Brien taking back play-calling duties from offensive coordinator Tim Kelly in Week 4. And a loss to the Vikings that dropped the team to 0-4 \u2014 all with the only true franchise quarterback in team history.\n\nBy that point in the season, the mismanagement of the Texans\u2019 roster was obvious. After trading a second-round pick for Brandin Cooks, whom Easterby identified as a good culture fit, Houston was the only team with four receivers counting for at least $6 million apiece against the cap. One of them, Kenny Stills, was such a nonfactor that the team cut him after he caught 11 passes in 10 games. The team\u2019s duo of receiving backs, David and Duke Johnson, was hardly a factor in the passing game \u2014 and collectively accounted for nearly as much cap space as all of the team\u2019s corners.\n\nAs for that \u201cvery valuable\u201d second-round pick the Texans acquired in the Hopkins trade: The team didn\u2019t use it to dip into a deep pool of receivers. With Notre Dame receiver Chase Claypool still on the board, as well as defensive rookie of the year candidate Antoine Winfield Jr., the Texans picked Ross Blacklock, a defensive lineman from TCU who played just 23 percent of the defense\u2019s snaps.\n\nHouston\u2019s maneuvering left some offensive skill positions overstocked at the expense of a defense that ranked 30th in efficiency. A source close to Watson likened the Texans\u2019 team-building approach to \u201ca kid in a video game,\u201d changing strategy on the fly.\n\nIf that was the case, then firing O\u2019Brien four games into the season \u2014 after empowering him with the general manager title and allowing him to trade away a star receiver \u2014 was McNair rage-quitting on the season from the owner\u2019s box. \u201cYou have an owner that is seen as inexperienced, and it\u2019s reinforced by the hiring of Easterby and giving him the status that he did,\u201d a longtime executive from another team said of McNair, who took control of the team from his late father in 2018 after six years as the team\u2019s COO. \u201cIf that had been a 15-year owner, you might say, \u2018OK, this guy has made good decisions here and here, so we will give him the benefit of the doubt.\u2019 Cal doesn\u2019t get that.\u201d\n\nNot even from his quarterback. Sources said after O\u2019Brien lost his job so soon following the roster overhaul, Watson questioned the Texans\u2019 plan \u2014 if they had one at all.\n\nWhen the team was 1-6, McNair said in a radio interview with a team employee that he hadn\u2019t given up hope on the playoffs, and that pandemic-related crowd reductions made a wild-card team\u2019s path to the Super Bowl easier than ever. The trade deadline was the day after McNair gave that interview, and though the Texans flirted with the Packers about a potential deal in which they would give up receiver Will Fuller, Houston ultimately stood pat. While Easterby acted as interim general manager, team sources said the Texans were hypersensitive to the perception of \u201closing\u201d any trade.\n\nA couple of weeks after the deadline, the Texans scored just seven points in a road loss to the Browns. As the wind whipped off Lake Erie, making it hard to throw, Houston came up empty on a fourth-and-goal play that could have swung the outcome. On the flight home from Cleveland, Watson watched another game: Bills at Cardinals. Eleven seconds remained, and Arizona had the ball at Buffalo\u2019s 48-yard line, down four points. The Cardinals\u2019 play call sent only one receiver to the end zone, and after quarterback Kyler Murray juked a defender and sprinted left toward the sideline, his pass landed above three defenders and into Hopkins\u2019 huge hands.\n\nThe NFL named this its Clutch Moment of the Year. Watson called it just another Hopkins play.\n\n\u201cNo surprise,\u201d he said.\n\n\nThe losing, especially the close defeats, wore on Watson, who won state championships in high school, a national championship at Clemson and never missed the playoffs in an NFL season he finished. After a goal-line fumble blew the Texans\u2019 upset bid against the Colts in Week 13, Watson sat on a bench while other players mingled and headed to their locker rooms. A towel covered the quarterback\u2019s head. \u201cThis shit hurts,\u201d he said that day. \u201cI\u2019m tired of losing.\u201d\n\nIn his season-ending news conference in January, Watson said the Texans needed \u201ca whole culture shift,\u201d adding the team had \u201ctoo many different minds, too many different ideas and too many people who think they have this power, and it\u2019s not like that.\u201d One source characterized it as \u201ca direct message to Cal McNair\u201d telling the owner to move on from Easterby, who is responsible for directing the team\u2019s culture and has amassed increasing influence, as detailed by Sports Illustrated in December.\n\nWatson also said the team needed patience as it began a journey toward a Super Bowl with a new general manager and coach. The day before, he\u2019d spoken to McNair by phone and endorsed keeping offensive coordinator Tim Kelly on staff. Based on previous conversations and public statements by McNair, Watson had the impression he\u2019d be involved in the Texans\u2019 search process.\n\nThat didn\u2019t happen.\n\nThe Texans\u2019 search committee \u2014 McNair, team president Jamey Rootes and Jed Hughes of the search firm Korn Ferry \u2014 interviewed four general manager candidates and three head-coaching candidates. But Chiefs offensive coordinator Eric Bienemy, of whom Watson had spoken highly, was not included in that group. Neither was the general manager the team ultimately hired, longtime Patriots director of player personnel Nick Caserio, although the Texans had already vetted him.\n\nHouston tried to hire Caserio after firing GM Brian Gaine in 2019, but after New England threatened tampering charges amid rumors that Easterby recruited Caserio at a Patriots Super Bowl ring party, the Texans dropped the pursuit. That created a power vacuum filled by O\u2019Brien and Easterby. When starting his GM search, McNair said that person would determine Easterby\u2019s role. Soon after the season, Easterby alerted McNair that Caserio, a friend with whom he shares an agent, could end up taking the Panthers\u2019 open GM job. Instead, the Texans embarked on a \u201cnew search,\u201d as McNair put it \u2014 and hired Caserio themselves. Just as with Hopkins, Watson found out about the big move on social media. He posted a cryptic, since-deleted tweet that evening: \u201cSome things never change \u2026\u201d\n\nIn an effort to minimize drama, McNair said during Caserio\u2019s introductory news conference that he understood Watson\u2019s point of view before embarking on the search process. But that didn\u2019t stop Watson from ignoring the Texans\u2019 calls and eventually requesting a trade \u2014 one that, if completed, would rank among the most high-profile transactions in NFL history. The Jets and Dolphins are two rumored preferred landing spots for Watson, whose no-trade clause gives him leverage. But a source said the quarterback is open to other teams and is aware that any trade with New York would limit the Jets\u2019 ability to build a quality roster around him. For now, the Texans are not engaging in Watson trade discussions with other teams, even while the possibility of Watson sitting out games looms over them. McNair said as recently as Feb. 12 that the team\u2019s stance won\u2019t change.\n\nThere\u2019s debate over how much influence a player should have on a team\u2019s hiring process, especially when it comes to vetting general manager candidates, but most team executives fault McNair for letting this mistake \u2014 a miscommunication at best and an unkept promise at worst \u2014 poison his team\u2019s future. In the end, Houston landed arguably the most qualified GM candidate while becoming the only team to hire a Black head coach this offseason, a point of emphasis in the league \u2014 yet the organization still managed to further alienate its franchise quarterback.\n\n\nAfter the final game of the season, Watson and Watt walked off the field, side by side. The Texans had just lost to the Titans, their fifth consecutive defeat, to wrap up a miserable 4-12 season. Watson had thrown for 365 yards and put up 38 points. Watt had two more tackles for loss and played in all 16 games for just the second time in the past five years. As had been the case too frequently, it wasn\u2019t enough.\n\nOver the years, Watt and Watson had become Houston icons. The Texans never made the playoffs until Watt showed up; they couldn\u2019t aspire for more until Watson arrived. The previous season was one of potential and promise, with Watson putting the Texans on the doorstep of their first AFC Championship Game. But the 2020 season was a disaster from any angle. As they headed for the locker room, Watson tapped Watt twice on the backside. Watt turned, and for a moment the pair stopped on the field.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Watt told him. \u201cWe wasted one of your years.\u201d\n\nIn the coming weeks, one of them would ask to be released and the other one would ask to be traded. Their time together in Houston was soon to be over, and as they neared the exit, Watt turned to Watson to repeat himself.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d",

        "There are exceptions. From wikipedia. \n\nPlaces where legal\nThere are public places in the United States where open containers are explicitly permitted:\n\nErie, Pennsylvania. Port city on Lake Erie has no open container laws. Numerous festivals and block parties in the city throughout the summer feature significant alcohol consumption on city streets and in city parks.\nHood River, Oregon. This port city that rests along the Columbia River has no open container laws, and allows drinking in public.\nThe city of Butte, Montana, prohibits open containers only between 2am and 8am. Drinking openly in the street is allowed throughout the city (and elsewhere in Montana where no local laws exist) during the other 18 hours of the day. A recent attempt to pass a comprehensive open container prohibition in Butte met with widespread opposition and was dropped. However, Montana state law does prohibit open containers in vehicles on a highway.\nIn the Power &amp; Light District of Kansas City, Missouri, a special Missouri state law preempts Kansas City's ordinary local law against open containers and allows the possession and consumption of alcoholic beverages on the street in open plastic containers. Although Missouri has no statewide open container law, the Power &amp; Light District remains the only part of Kansas City where open containers are allowed actually on the street, and throughout the rest of Kansas City, open containers remain expressly prohibited.\nIn unincorporated Clark County, Nevada (including the Las Vegas Strip) the laws allow the possession and consumption on the street of alcoholic beverages except within parking lots or, if the alcohol was purchased in a closed container, on the premises of or within 1000 feet of the store from which it was purchased. It is also illegal to possess a glass or aluminum beverage container on specially designated streets during special events, such as the Strip on New Year's Eve.\nThe city of New Orleans, Louisiana allows the possession and consumption on the street of any alcoholic beverage in an open plastic container (not in glass bottles or containers). In some parts of Louisiana, however, open containers are still prohibited, despite the fact that drive-thru frozen daiquiri stands are legal.\nIn the Savannah Historic District of downtown Savannah, Georgia, city law allows possession and consumption on the street of one alcoholic beverage in an open plastic container of not more than 16 ounces. Because Georgia has no state public open container law, the city law governs. Throughout the rest of Savannah, however, open containers remain prohibited.\nWithin an approximately 80-acre area of downtown Dalton, Georgia, city law allows possession and consumption on the street of one alcoholic beverage in an open paper or plastic cup of no more than 16 ounces between 12:30 p.m. and midnight. The boundaries of the permitted area are Hawthorne Street, the western right-of-way of the L&amp;N Railway, Morris Street, and Thornton Avenue. The beverage must be dispensed by a licensed establishment in the designated area in a cup that meets specifications issued by the Downtown Dalton Development Authority. Throughout the rest of Dalton, however, open containers remain prohibited.\nThe town of Fredericksburg, Texas allows open containers of beer or wine (no liquor) in its Main street shopping district.\nThe state of Ohio, since 2015, allows cities to create a limited number of designated \"outdoor refreshment areas\" where alcoholic beverages are permitted (Sub. H.B. No. 47). Cities that have created these districts include Canton, Delaware, Hamilton, Lancaster, Lorain, Middletown and Toledo.\nThe city of Mobile, Alabama allows open plastic containers with a commercially printed name and/or logo of a designated licensee.\nThe city of Tampa, Florida allows up to two drinks in plastic containers per person on the Tampa Riverwalk, purchased from one of the licensed facilities along it, between 11am and 1am.\nAs of August 28th, 2020, Governor Phil Murphy has signed a bill making public drinking allowed in tourist spots such as the beach and boardwalk of Atlantic City, New Jersey\nIndiana actually has no restrictions on the open carrying of alcohol in public spaces. Patrons are allowed to carry an alcoholic beverage in its original container out of a premise and consume it on the sidewalks.",

        "**The worst thing is how fcking wrong this meme is.**   \n\\[ First we had GamerGate &amp; Memes turning people to the Alt-Right, now we have retarded Memes used by the Left \\]\n\n8 Million Clean Water : ( Morons and priviliged white kids who don't know shit, shouldn\\`t talk about Hydropolitics, it makes me mad tbh... ) \n\n1. More than 1.8 Billion people don't have access to Clean Water. This is actually massively improving, since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1990, 2.2 Billion people GAINED access to clean water.  \nStill the number is astronomically high and that clearly can't be fixed easily. \n2. Climate, Drought, War, Corruption, Agricultural Modernization, Labour shortages in critical areas, Overpopulation Et Cetera.... so many factors come into play --&gt; Economic Mismanagement, which would be the Capitalist vs. Socialist argument, plays a very small and mostly passive role.   \n3% of Earth's water is clean, 2/3 of which are in the Ice Caps.   \nWater has to be intentionally cleaned and you need resources and economic capital to do so.    \nCapitalist countries seem to be doing a better job at it to a) Water Treatment, b) Water redistribution and c) Water-quality standards which are enforced.   \nIn ( former ) socialist countries you literally have the 4th largest sea ( Aral Sea ) disappearing due to their centralized Economy ( for Cotton production ) and the most toxic lake ( Karachay ) on Earth, again due to their centralized Economy ( for Chemical production/waste ). \n3. Pollution plays a big role, but most water-pollution isn't actually caused by Human activity. Yes, Toxic, Plastic or whatever waste that gets thrown into water ( not Ocean, since not relevant to topic ) is a problem.   \nBut the Water Ecosystems are naturally toxic and polluted.   \nSo many rivers and lakes are polluted by having too many Nutrients ( especially Nitrate and Phosphorus ), caused by Animal and Plant Waste ---&gt; Especially dead biomatter turn the water toxic....   \n\"Dead Zone\" is a mostly naturally occuring thing, where Seas and Lakes turn too toxic which kill almost all aquatic lifeforms.   \nMost of these go through Circles ---  Lake Erie ( one of the 5 Great Lakes ) turns toxic every summer due to it's Cyanobacteria ( as a funfact, Cyanobacteria killed 99% of all lifeforms in the Great Oxidation Crisis 2.35 billion years ago ).   \nThe best pollution controls, especially those caused by Humans, also happen primarily in Capitalist countries.... \n4. Capitalism isn't the problem here at all...   \nThere are only 2 major sources of Freshwater that isn't dependent on rainfall a) Desalination of water and b) Recycled Wastewater... Both of these require a lot of energy, especially the Arabic oil-countries managed to fix their clean-water \"crisis\" due to Desalination.   \nInnovation could make this more cost-efficient which could become a solution for African and Asian countries....   \nBut again, in order to even think of those solution, they need to fix a lot and pretending it can be fixed by switching to Socialism is ultra-moronic.   \nThe country most affected by a lack of Clean Water is Sierra Leone ---&gt; Massive government corruption is the primary reason for it, water is nationalized in most countries anyway in case you didn't know.... The civil War that ended in 2002, the economy being focused on mineral extraction, and 80% being employed in Agriculture are also important factors. I can't really see how \"capitalism\" should be responsible for that.\n\n\\----\n\nThe claim that 3 million die of curable diseases and 500.000 of Malaria is the fault of Capitalism how exactly ?   \nThe only countries with Free Universal Healthcare are Capitalist by the way, this is exclusive to Capitalism.   \nChina doesn't have Free Universal Healthcare ( yet ). It doesn't cover everyone and mostly basic-services, you always have to pay the full cost upfront and the insurance later refunds some of it ( in the end, if the insurance covers, you pay 70-80% in urban areas and 20-40% in Rural ones ) --- Though since 2008 they plan to reform the system, one of their goals is that you no longer pay for medicine.   \nThe only Socialist countries that did have that, were Cuba ( which has healthcare problems since the end of Soviet subsidies ) and the USSR ( though later, the government massively underfunded the Health-system, since it prioritized other sectors, the USSR spend more on it's Military and the Nuclear Arms Race than the USA ), nevertheless the Soviet healthcare system did it's job and did make the same achievements as capitalist ones, such as mass immunizations and the eradication of nasty diseases.   \nHowever by the 1980s the Soviet healthcare system was massively lacking behind it's capitalist counterparts, as they lacked everything, except beds and doctors --&gt; equipment, medicine, doctors, and so much more, while the technical standard was NOT updated to the modern standard. \n\nI derailed a bit, all in all  the people who die by preventable diseases are usually not in Capitalist countries and you can still die by a preventable disease, even if treatment and cost are free, you know ? So this whole point of the meme is stupidity of the highest order. \n\n\\-----\n\nHunger, just like Water, is mostly caused by other factors... not the economic system, but I ran out of character limit :P \n\n\\---\n\nThe meme is all in all really stupid, without a source none of these claims are valid.\n\n1. What classifies as a capitalist country ?  \nUsing the Economic Freedom Index, almost no African and Asian country qualifies as Capitalist, yet those causes of death are almost exclusive to those 2 continents.....\n2. How does it compare, per-capita, to socialist countries.  \n3. How would Socialism fix it ? \n4. Why can't Capitalism fix this ? I.e. why need Socialism in particular ?\n5. How would Socialism prevent large-scale disasters and famines which happen almost exclusively in socialist countries. ( or are we pretending the famines didn't happen again ).   \nI mean the \"Four Pest Campaign\", to eradicate Sparrows, rats, flies and Mosquitoes only happened in a Socialist Country and it brought about the Great Chinese famine which killed 15-55 million people....   \nOr Lysenkoism, absolute madness......   \n\"Traditional genetics and Darwinist theory is wrong, Plants only grow if they want to.\"  \n\"Plants have to compete with other Plants to grow strong, let's make all agricultural fields into a Trial by Combat by plating 5 seeds in one plough, the winning Plant will evolve and spread it's superior, acquired, genes\"  \n\"If you cut a tree, you change it's genetics, trust me\".   \n\"Everyone who disagrees that my \"Potions\" and theories will fix agriculture is a capitalist pig and spreading Bourgeoise misinformation\".",

        "AGENT LEAKS Debunk\n\n\n**Oct 2016** \n\n&gt;Prelude never existed. Motion Capture timelines are off.\n\n&gt;Incorrect, reshoots were done for content throughout the campaign, primarily the end. Also Prelude never existed.\n\n&gt;This is rather vague but can't exactly be proven either for or against\n\n&gt;Old shoots were done on similar set ups, cameras, and equipment. \n\n&gt;See above\n\n&gt;This is both correct and incorrect. A lot of inbetweens were or are being redone as need be but most general mocap is the same as recorded initially. Inbetweens and some mid-mission animations being more notable but it's primarily done off the older data. To say \"almost all scenes\" is hyperbolic as hell.\n\n&gt;Prelude never existed. Fights didn't happen for something that didn't exist.\n\n&gt;This is S42, you think things are being held back for a reduced vision? lol.\n\n&gt;There's no singular \"Mess Hall Scene\" but to be fair there's no way to really verify this one\n\n&gt;The Morrow Tour was never the beginning of Squadron 42. \n\n&gt;Nope\n\n&gt;Nope but the Faceware bit was obvious.\n\n&gt;CIG didn't handle the camera from any sort of standpoint, it was handled almost entirely. No employee would know the status of how it was being developed, but it was not in any sort of \"killed off\" phase until a few years after this was stated. \n\n&gt;No, also see above.\n\n&gt;No again, also see above.\n\n&gt;This never was planned or set up to happen.\n\n&gt;Nope. This never happened. An offline experience PU wise wasn't even sketched out at this phase. Literally all of the \"offline PU\" stuff never was even conceptually an idea at CIG at the time.\n\n**Jan 8th, 2017**\n\n&gt;S42 Prelude never existed. \n\n&gt;See above\n\n&gt;See above\n\n&gt;See above\n\n&gt;duh.\n\n&gt;This is kind of truer now than it was at the time, but at the time there was plans for completely offline play but more so planning for the future.\n\n&gt;This one is a bit obvious.\n\n&gt;haha no.\n\n**Oct 11, 2019 pt. 1**\n\n&gt;points 1 through 7 are either not relevant, not at all knowledge anyone who's a dev would know, and also not true if you look into even the modern numbers.\n\n&gt;The rest of the points can be gathered by going onto CIG's glassdoor and just hearing a slight bit of the rumors surrounding the project. While some of it is true, especially the favoritism, a large chunk of it is hyperbolic or just straight up untrue (Jared comment lol)\n\n**Oct 11th, 2019 pt. 2**\n\n&gt;A lot of this post was built off the landclaims being for sale and are based off the rumors of expansion into more monetization through them. All of it in terms of planning is fake, and Earth was never developed.\n\n**Jan 8th, 2020**\n\n&gt;this one feels googleable\n\n&gt;CIG does get them juicy tax incentives but it's not the driving force of expansion. That's called ***whales***\n\n&gt;ha no\n\n&gt;points 4-8 feel like a standard game dev thing and it's shitty but it's just how it be and isn't exactly insider info. CIG is worse than other companies at this though which is important to note especially when it comes to communications.\n\n&gt;There's no large third party help. You *may* count Turbulent for this but that was more a collaboration and can be quantified as a first party effort due to how much CIG has thrown on the table.\n\n&gt;See above\n\n&gt;see above\n\n&gt;See above\n\n&gt;see above\n\n&gt;See above\n\n&gt;Incorrect. None of the current mission givers make an appearance through S42.\n\n&gt;Didn't happen\n\n&gt;See above\n\n**July 8th, 2020**\n\n&gt;Points 1-9: Woah who would've ever guessed that one of the world's worse events in recent history was a hurdle. The bits that are vague happened obviously especially with communication but the specifics are wrong.\n\n&gt;Turbulent did not help with these two specific games, nor did they do anything regarding the events at the time or the cinematics.\n\n&gt;Didn't happen\n\n&gt;See above\n\n&gt;HAHAHAHAHAH no. This was never planned.\n\n&gt;Who would've ever guessed ships are individually tuned when being created.\n\n&gt;Why would you move away from above. There's no automation coming to just press button and make ship.\n\n&gt;No. As of today this isn't planned or will be planned.\n\n&gt;Updates have been pretty on point especially during these times.\n\n&gt;See below\n\n&gt;S42 PRELUDE NEVER EXISTED. Like seriously you don't even a dev to figure that one out. \n\n&gt;See above.\n\n&gt;See above.\n\n**Sep 24th, 2020**\n\n&gt;S42 prelude doesn't exist.\n\n&gt;S42 prelude doesn't exist.\n\n&gt;S42 prelude doesn't exist.\n\n&gt;s42 prelude doesn't exist.\n\n&gt;That's uh, not how it works.

        "Okay, I'm just going to try and give you as much info as I can. Some things may overlap with or just be repeats of what others have said.\n\n* Lighthouse Point: There is a total of 64 lakefront cottages which are oriented for lake views with their fronts facing the lake. The only park views from inside a cottage will usually be from the bedroom window, unfortunately. You can click the 'view map' button [here](https://www.cedarpoint.com/resorts/lighthouse-point) to see a full, detailed map of the Lighthouse Point area. You can also see the resort's proximity to certain coasters on Google Maps satellite/3D view. There isn't a ton to see and do at Lighthouse Point, but there is a nice pier, a pool with a hot tub, shuffleboard court and convenience store. There is a free shuttle for resort guests and there are multiple shuttle stops throughout the resort area. Shuttles can take you anywhere on the peninsula, including right up to the resort entrance, commonly referred to as the Magnum entrance. All resort guests have access to this entrance during early entry, which begins at 9 a.m.. I believe the parking toll booth opens around 7:00 and you can pick up your early entry passes at the front desk beginning at 8:00 on your arrival day. I suggest you try to arrive around 8:00 on your arrival day and head to the front desk ASAP to get your early entry passes.\n* Rope Drop Strategy: Almost everyone will head to SV first, and if you haven't ridden it yet, I highly recommend you follow suit. This is obviously subjective, but the general consensus is that SV is one of, if not THE best roller coaster in the world. Demand for it is very high and wait times can be absolutely insane. 2+ hours is typical on a busy day. You can make seat requests on almost every coaster except MF (I think). Dragster will likely not be open during early entry and may not even open for a few hours, but the general rule is that as soon as you see it testing, head for it. I believe Wicked Twister being removed is just speculation, but if anyone has definitive proof of this, please correct me.\n* Best food inside the park: \n\nYou can see a full list of all of CP's food locations, along with many reviews [here](https://cpfoodblog.com/park-food-guides/cedar-point-food/). Some listings are not updated, but it will give you a good idea of what's good and what you can skip. You can find elephant ears at Stockade Refreshments in Frontier Town and French Quarter Confections at the front of the park. Stockade offers a cinnamon and sugar elephant ear for about $7, while French Quarter has a customizable version for about $13, which includes 3 toppings.\n\n1. **BackBeatQue**, located just inside the resort gate. Very good BBQ with a variety of meats and side options. Each meal includes 1 meat, 1 side and a piece of cornbread. No air-conditioned seating, but the outdoor seating area is very nice and there are often live bands playing on the small outdoor stage the restaurant. \n2. **Melt**, located near the front of the park, adjacent to Planet Snoopy. This is a Cleveland-based local chain with gourmet grilled cheese, mac and cheese, sandwiches and salads, along with a large variety of craft beers. Air-conditioned seating. Very cool atmosphere decorated with tons of old park signs and CP memorabilia. \n3. **Hugo's**, located near Sky Ride and Raptor. This is probably your best option for Italian food in the park, serving personal pizzas, pasta, stromboli and salads. Air-conditioned seating with some overflow picnic tables. \n4. **Miss Keat's**, located in Frontier Town across from Cedar Creek Mine Ride. Another good BBQ place with similar offerings to BackBeatQue, except (as far as I know) it has air-conditioned seating.\n5. **Mac Shack, Chickie's &amp; Pete's, Lakeside Express**, all located near the front of the park.  Mac Shack serves custom mac and cheese bowls, Chickie's &amp; Pete's is famous for their crabfries and cheesesteaks, and Lakeside Express serves fresh-caught Lake Erie perch sandwiches. I've read a lot of mixed reviews on these, but most people agree that they're some of the better in-park options.\n\n* Best food outside the park:\n\n1. Hotel Breakers has several decent restaurants, including a Perkins, TGI Fridays and TOMO, a hibachi-style restaurant.\n2. Famous Dave's is located on the marina across the street from Valravn and is another BBQ restaurant. Great views of the lake and a good place to go if you need shelter from a pop-up storm and don't want to be bumping shoulders with strangers as everyone crams themselves into the nearest gift shop.\n3. The Thirsty Pony is located at the corner of Cleverland Rd. and Cedar Point Dr. Typical (though very good) bar food (burgers, wings, pizza) with eccentric decor. This is a very popular choice (read: tourist trap) for CP guests and is often crowded and loud, but can be a good choice for a break from the park without straying too far from the action.\n4. Quaker Steak and Lube is basically across the street from The Thirsty Pony, just a little further east on Cleveland Rd. This is a regional chain that has a large menu with wings as their claim to fame. The menu is mostly bar food, but it's generally very good.\n5. Dairy Queen and McDonald's are located across from each other on Cedar Point Drive near the Express Hotel. Definitely not the best food, but you know what you're getting. These can be convenient and cheaper than the park's offerings, but prices are higher than these chains' other locations. \n\nI wasn't expecting this reply to be so long, but here we are. I hope this helps you plan your trip. My only other tips are to try to go in with low or no expectations. That way you can (theoretically) only have your expectations exceeded. Also, don't expect early entry to be a perfect empty park experience. There are quite a few people who are eligible for it, with all Platinum Passholders, Gold Passholders and all CP resort guests having access to at least 30 minutes of early entry time. Large crowds, weather and mechanical delays could mean that you only get one ride in during early entry. Aside from that, I don't have much to add. This reply is long enough. \ud83d\ude01",

        "Full text. If the formatting isn't good, deal with it...\n\nCLEVELAND, Ohio \u2013 The city of Cleveland and the Browns propose building a broad elevated park that would soar over railroad lines and the Shoreway and expand public access between downtown and the lakefront.  \nThe project envisions a long, gradually sloping green ribbon \u2013 about 350 feet wide -- that would connect Mall C downtown to North Coast Harbor and land adjacent to FirstEnergy Stadium.  \nIt would solve a problem Cleveland has wrestled with for more than a century \u2013 how to span the gap between the city\u2019s downtown and the waterfront so that residents have access to Cleveland\u2019s biggest asset.  \n\u00a0  \nThe project arose out of interest by the Cleveland Browns owners Jimmy and Dee Haslam, who approached Mayor Frank Jackson and suggested a planning group explore ways to develop a signature lakefront for Cleveland, said Edward Rybka, Jackson\u2019s chief of regional development  \n\u00a0  \nJackson has long favored such a project and considers the lakefront Cleveland\u2019s front door, Rybka said. The planning group offered a way to explore that goal.  \nDesigns by a landscape architect hired by the Browns envision the open land that surrounds the stadium be developed as greenspace, providing maximum public access to the area, while allowing for some housing and commercial development.  \nThat vision will be put to the test over the next several months.  \nCleveland has applied to the Ohio Department of Transportation for $5.6 million for initial design work and conceptual engineering on the project. The city would put up $2.5 million toward that design, according to the Transportation Review Advisory Council application.  \nThat work would be done over 18 months and would lead to 30% complete design documents according to Osborn Engineering.  \nHere are some things to know about the project.  \nWhat is the vision?  \nThe Browns hired Nelson Byrd Woltz Landscape Architects, a nationally prominent firm, to create renderings showing the possibilities of the project. Osborn Engineering helped with traffic flow issues.  \n\u201cAt the forefront for us is what\u2019s best for the community,\u201d said David Jenkins, chief operating officer for the Haslam Sports Group.  \n\u00a0  \nThe architect plans envision an area that provides green space on nearly 30 acres that wrap around the stadium. The property is large enough, though, that the designs also include residential buildings with hundreds of units and thousands of square feet of office, retail, and hotel space.  \n\u00a0  \n\u201cIt\u2019s really about making a very public space for the entire city,\u201d said Thomas Woltz, a principal for Nelson Bird Woltz.  \nHow would that work?  \nThe goal would be to create a campus that uses greenspace to tie together the Great Lakes Science Center, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, the stadium and the new housing, retail, and hotels, Woltz said.  \nThe land bridge, known as a plinth, would end east of the stadium and north of the Great Lakes Science Center, near where the NFL Draft\u2019s main stage was set up. That north end is envisioned as a balcony view of Lake Erie, with room for public space to be built underneath.  \n\u00a0  \nThe designs include a cut into the property where kayakers could descend stairs to access the water. Designers envisioned a terrace at the northwest corner of the property from which visitors could watch the sunset.  \n\u00a0  \nEast Ninth Street and West Third Streets would be grade-level intersections with the Shoreway, which is envisioned as a boulevard. The roadway would pass under the plinth just west of East Ninth.  \nThe ramp to the Main Avenue bridge would be removed, opening more property for redevelopment. That part of the Shoreway would be routed into West Third.  \nAt the southern portion of the land bridge there would be access to the Amtrak and RTA stations. Another viewpoint would allow people in the park to look down and watch passing trains.  \n\u00a0  \nHow much would it cost?  \nHundreds of millions of dollars.  \nThe project could carry a cost of $229 million, according to the city\u2019s TRAC application.  \nOnce the design is complete, Cleveland would seek $200 million in construction money from the state, the application said.  \nOther money could be available through federal sources, such as through infrastructure funding now being considered in Congress.  \nWhat would happen to the stadium?  \nJenkins said the Haslams began discussions with the city about the waterfront a few years ago.  \nAt that point, the team was entering the last 10 years of their lease, which expires in 2028, and needed to start looking at what its next step would be.  \nThe designs by Nelson Byrd Woltz affect property around the stadium, but do not contemplate replacing FirstEnergy Stadium. They include plans for a parking garage under part of the plinth north of the reworked Shoreway.  \nJenkins said that at this point the Browns are only contemplating renovations.  \nIs this design locked in?  \n\u00a0  \nNo.  \nWoltz described the designs primarily as a landscape project. Those designs could be used to show the state what is possible as it considers funding for engineering.  \nBut public input would be sought, Rybka said, if the project moves forward.  \n\u201cThis is a vision, not a conclusion. It has to be further studied,\u201d Rybka said. \u201cIt is a bold statement in a signature project.\u201d  \nWhat about other lakefront development?  \nWhile the Nelson Byrd Woltz drawings focused on the nearly 30 acres around FirstEnergy Stadium, they also identified more than 70 acres total that could be open to development.  \nThat property includes Cleveland\u2019s municipal lots, property adjacent to the Shoreway that would be available with the reworking of the road and land now covered by the ramp to the Main Avenue bridge.  \nWhat happens next?  \nCleveland\u2019s TRAC application will be presented to ODOT for its first review on June 2, said Bonnie Teeuwen, director of municipal and transportation engineering at Osborn Engineering.  \nA final review will be made on June 23. Finalists for TRAC funding are expected to be announced in mid-July, with the recipients announced in late August.",

        "That's a good question, I've skimmed a few cases so far and no mention of such behavior yet.  I think I've heard that one, or a similar one before, strange behavior.  I'll certainly make a note to pull any that take on any water.  \n\nI've started looking at an intriguing one with coast guard, police, an astronomer with a telescope and civilians witnessed a black triangle break through the ice and fuck around in the skies for a bit before taking off.  Apparently there are photo's, haven't finished going through it yet completely.  \n\nI dunno it seems like one with a lot of \"meat\" which can be dug into to find out what's what.  Gonna try to find other sources, etc.  1988, it occurs to me in the social media age it may even be possible to track down some of these people and ask them direct questions.  \n\n&gt;Coast Guard personnel responding to citizen reports of unusual aerial activity over Lake Erie on March 4, 1988, witnessed classic UFOs near Eastlake, OH. Sheila and Henry Baker were driving home with their three children about 8:35 P.M., after taking them out to dinner, and were almost home. As they neared the waterfront, Sheila noticed something hovering over the lake; they drove down to the beach to investigate and got out of the car. The moon was bright, and there was ice on the lake; Sheila could hear it cracking like claps of thunder.  \nPlainly visible was a huge, gunmetal gray,football-shaped, silent object rocking back and forth, blinding white light emanating from both ends.  \nThen the object began moving, swinging one end toward the shore and descending. The Bakers became frightened, ran back to their car, and fled.  \nWhen they got home, the object was still visible from a window facing the lake. Sheila hid the children in a closet, fearing that the thing might come and get them.  \nThe object moved out over the ice and continued to descend, with red and blue lights now flashing in sequence along its lower edge.  \nSheila called the Eastlake police to report a UFO, and after several referrals, with no one expressing much interest, was told that unusual activity over the lake would be the responsibility of the Coast Guard.  Suddenly five or six bright yellow triangular objects shot out of the center of the large object and began darting around independently (satellite objects). Once they stopped and hovered point up around the parent object, then sped away to the north, turned east, then inland toward the Perry nuclear power plant.  \nAt this point Sheila called the Coast Guard, which sent a team to their house to investigate. Seaman james Power and Petty Officer john Knaub arrived towing a Boston Whaler (a seaworthy boat) just in case. They told the Bakers that they had seen some lights over the lake from Fairport Harbor and thought they were flares, maybe fishermen trapped out on the ice. However, when Sheila pointed to the main craft and some of the triangular objects still zipping around it, the men drove closer to the lake to investigate, accompanied by the Bakers. At the lakefront they could hear the ice rumbling and roaring.  \nIn their incident report sent later by teletype to Coast Guard headquarters in Detroit, Ml, the men were quoted as saying that \"the ice was cracking and moving abnormal amounts as the object came closer to it.\"  \nPower and Knaub gave a running report on what they were seeing to their base via the two-way radio in their Chevy Suburban.  The window was down, and the Bakers overheard them saying words to the\neffect: \"Be advised the object appears to be landing on the lake ....  \nThere are other objects moving around it. Be advised these smaller objects are going at high rates of speed. There are no engine noises and they are very, very low.\"  \nAbruptly one of the triangles zoomed straight toward the Coast Guard vehicle, a blur of light, then veered east, straight up, and came down beside the parent object. Two witnesses in separate locations also reported seeing the triangles. Cindy Hale was walking her dog when she noticed a triangular object hovering overhead, and her dog began to whine and cower (animal reactions). She took the dog indoors and came back out to watch.  The triangle flashed a series of multicolored lights, then accelerated and was gone without making a sound (hover-acceleration).  \nTim Keck was using his astronomical telescope when one of the triangles caught his eye. He had a cheap throwaway camera with him and snapped a picture of the object before it flew away over the horizon. The photograph was analyzed by optical physicist Bruce Maccabee, who considered it to be a legitimate image of an unexplained object (see section VII, Photographs).  \nBack at the lake the Coast Guard team and Henry Baker continued to watch for over an hour.  Sheila went home and continued to observe from the window.  \nHenry overheard the men saying such things to their base as, \"You should be advised that the object is now shining lights all over the lake and it's turning different colors.\" The noise of the rumbling ice was thunderous, and the men had to yell to be heard on the radio.  \nSuddenly the triangles returned and one by one entered the side of the parent object as it seemed to land on the ice.  The object flashed a series of red, blue, and yellow lights, the light emanating from the end of the object turned from white to red, and the triangles reemerged and hovered above it.  The noise from the ice abruptly ceased, and the lights and triangles disappeared. When it was over the Coast Guard men drove away, \"white-faced,\" according to Henry Baker.  \nNext morning nothing was visible other than scattered chunks of broken ice.  But that evening the triangles reappeared.  \nSheila again called the Coast Guard, which this time sent a three-man team, but by the time they arrived, the objects were no longer visible.",

        "For a scale I start with home and go from there. So here goes my(poor) explanation of my home area as a DnD setting with minimal(and very poetically licensed) details. I live in southeast Michigan, a county is about 30 miles square. That's 900 square miles. A village could comfortably fit in a quarter mile square, and you would be away from it's fields and into the next set of trees by the time you have gone a mile. You can look at this on the Google maps if you need, or any state map set. To bound this map, I will focus on Monroe, Wayne, and Washtenaw counties. There are similarly dense counties just north of Wayne and Washtenaw, and more rural counties to the west of Washtenaw and Monroe. But each of the rural counties still has a significant city and several towns and villages.\n\nThere are two large and very different cities, each with a river named for them, separated by philosophy and distance.\n\nDetroit(the far east side of Wayne county and mightiest city because of its command of the Detroit river, an important trade route that gives the only water access to the great lakes of Huron, Superior and Michigan, in contention with Windsor which is on the other side of the river and in a different country)\n\n\n Toledo(south of Monroe county and commanding both sides of a river which empties into lake Erie about 50 miles south of Detroit)\n\nIn other locations necessary to flesh out the setting we can follow other waterways.\n\nThe Huron is a lesser river, but still significant. Quickly described for the counties described here it runs from some inland lakes northwest of Washtenaw county to the Detroit river at a point somewhat south(downriver) of Detroit and about 30 miles above the Toledo river, meandering in a generally southeast direction. It has a few cities and towns.\n\nAnn Arbor, a lesser river city noted for a hospital and university. \n\n Ypsilanti is downstream four to ten miles from Ann Arbor, and was once a thriving industrial town also with a university (but a lesser one with a different focus). Now the industry has mostly left, and the city works to rebuild itself.\n\nBelleville, downstream from Ypsilanti, is mostly built around the lake that came from a dam built to harness the Huron for power. \n\nWhere once there were several industrial centers, focusing the manufacturing power and expertise of the area in a few square miles near the river, now these places are mostly abandoned, or are cared for but idle.\n\nAs you continue downstream, the river flows without a specific city, but various Hamlet's are nearby, until you are south of the main airport and come upon New Boston, which is a town sitting on what was once an important trade route. A few miles further you reach Flat Rock, which has a similar tale, except that it lies on the ancient overland trade route from Detroit to Toledo known as the telegraph road. Next you encounter Rockwood, which is mostly built up because the newer faster overland route between Detroit and Toledo runs very near, with a dedicated access point.\n\n\nAnother river of note is the Raisin. It connects Adrian, the main city of the county west of Monroe, with Lake Erie, at a point between the Huron River and the Toledo river. Its two major forks collect water from the North and South of the Irish Hills area and connects many of the towns, villages and cities that exist between the Huron and Toledo rivers. \n\nHeading East from Adrian on the river you encounter many small towns, Palmyra, Blissfield, Deerfield and Petersburg, before you come to Dundee.\n\nDundee, located in the best places that could be built on at the intersection of the Ann Arbor/Toledo land trade route with the Monroe/Brooklyn/Jackson trade route and the place where the river raisin gets significantly wider as it heads toward Monroe and lake Erie.\n\nMonroe is built around the river Raisin and the overland trade route between Detroit and Toledo. It is also noted for having produced a man famous for participating in genocide and being sent to divine justice for it before he had a chance to get old.\n\nWithout expanding at all on Detroit or Toledo, I have a setting like this. And I haven't even touched half the map. Probably not even a third. Sure, I could scale up for more distance if I really want to, but there is no need. In a ninety mile circle you can have agriculture, trade routes, multiple city states, more hamlets, villages, and towns than you can name, world famous institutions, and anything else you might want.  Ninety mile circle, with most of it hazy. Two hundred yards by two hundred yards is less than 1/64 of a square mile. Most stories you are going to tell don't need more than that amount of space. You can fit a lot of stories into a few square miles.",

        "Northern Ohio native here:\n\nI agree that the bulk of your time is best spent in Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula...especially along Lake Superior. Pictured Rocks, Tahquamenon Falls, and honestly I haven\u2019t made it further west yet because there\u2019s so much cool stuff in the eastern part\u2014but I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s all fantastic. It isn\u2019t *quite* as mind-blowing as the Western US, but it is among the best of the East with the Appalachian Mountains and the beaches.\n\nNiagara Falls is a must-see. In fact, I\u2019d rank it as the only real \u201cmust-see\u201d natural landmark East of the Mississippi. The best place to see the Falls is on the Canadian side though, and sadly, I don\u2019t think the border is welcoming tourists yet. Check into this before planning anything on the Canadian side.\n\nSince everyone has pretty well covered Michigan, I\u2019ll share the best stops in Ohio:\n\n* **Best natural beach on Lake Erie\u2014Headlands Beach State Park** near Grand River/Mentor/Painesville. You get to see what Lake Erie looked like before the breakwalls and all the civilization caused a ton of erosion. There\u2019s a nature reserve here where you can see dunes that look exactly like what you\u2019d find on the Atlantic Coast.\n\n* **Cedar Point** is a perennial top-tier amusement park, and has the best and biggest collection of roller coasters on the planet\u2014but if you\u2019re not into roller coasters, then this may not be a big deal to you.\n\n* **Cleveland** has several world class museums, including the Museum of Art (free), Botanical Garden, and Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame. CMA has a fantastic medieval armor collection, and even a couple of Van Goghs. Most of these museums are in the University Circle Cultural District, which has some great parks and architecture around. Downtown is loaded with architecture too...including the Arcade across from E 4th St, and the Cleveland Trust Rotunda which is now a Heinen\u2019s Grocery Store. Ohio City is another great neighborhood with the historic West Side Market and the city\u2019s brewery district. Great Lakes and Market Garden are great picks here, and you want to try Mitchell\u2019s Ice Cream. Lakewood is another great part of town, with lots of walkable neighborhoods along Detroit and Madison Avenues, and a great promenade for watching the sunset at Lakewood Park. Edgewater Park on Cleveland\u2019s West Side offers the best view of Lake Erie and the skyline.\n\n* **Cuyahoga Valley Natl Park** has great hikes, like Stanford House to Brandywine Falls and Blue Hen &amp; Buttermilk Falls. Hale Farm &amp; Village is great for seeing what life was like in the early days of Westward Expansion, and renting a bicycle in Peninsula to ride the Ohio &amp; Erie Towpath Trail is another great activity, especially if they\u2019re running the Bike Aboard program again, where you can ride the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad back to where you started.\n\n* **Put-in-Bay on the Lake Erie Islands** by Sandusky/Port Clinton is a fun place to take the Miller Ferry or the JetExpress across and spend the day. You can rent a bicycle or a golf cart to get around, or you can just walk if you take the JetExpress.\n\n* **Amish Country** abounds to the south of Cleveland in Holmes and Tuscarawas Counties, and to the east in Geauga County. Lots of interesting shopping and restaurants are here, along with the gorgeous rolling hills of the Allegheny Plateau (Appalachian Foothills).\n\n* **Lake Erie Wine Country** east of Cleveland in Lake and Ashtabula Counties has plenty of wineries, and a few distilleries in rural areas and in small towns. You can check out some of Ashtabula\u2019s covered bridges while you\u2019re there.\n\n* **Pro Football Hall of Fame** is in Canton, if you\u2019re into the NFL.\n\n* **Hocking Hills State Park** is way out on the other end of the state, but well worth the detour if you pass nearby. It has the best hiking in the state, hands down, with trails leading through narrow gorges with waterfalls and huge caves.",

        "Hmm, no paywall for me.  Maybe you need to go incognito or something...\n\n----------------------------\n\nSANDUSKY, Ohio\u2014When the CDC said it was safe for fully vaccinated people to stop wearing face masks, Angela Warren quietly changed the sign at the gym she co-owns, from \u201cmasks are mandated\u201d to \u201cmasks are recommended.\u201d\n\nThe clients at her gym look a lot like Sandusky. Some can\u2019t be bothered with masks or Covid-19 at all. Many are vaccinated. Others say they never will be.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t judge,\u201d she tells people.\n\nIn communities across America, masks have become a symbol of the personal anxieties that have divided friends and neighbors throughout the pandemic. People have been forced to make difficult decisions, weighing their physical and mental health against their economic livelihoods and those of others.\n\nBusiness owners in cities like Sandusky can\u2019t blame their decisions on a faraway corporate parent. Their decisions on masks have meant confronting friends, neighbors and co-workers on a daily basis. In the 60% of America that lives in cities with fewer than 50,000 people, that can be a deeply personal task.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not big enough that people can segregate from each other,\u201d said Eric Wobser, the city manager. \u201cWe only have one downtown. If you\u2019re going to go downtown, you\u2019re going there whether you\u2019re Republican, Democrat, Black or white.\u201d\nNexxt Level Fit Academy co-owner Angela Warren changed signs to say \u2018masks are recommended\u2019 after the CDC said fully vaccinated people can stop wearing masks for most activities.\n\nThe county went to Barack Obama twice, but pivoted its support in the 2016 presidential election to Donald Trump and voted to re-elect him in 2020. The Covid-19 pandemic has also been a split.\n\nWhen the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention changed its guidance this month, businesses in Sandusky grappled with whether to follow suit.\n\nAt the family diner on Washington Street, several large signs told customers to wear masks unless they were seated. When a masked couple stood around too long talking to another table that was unmasked, Jackie Repp, the diner\u2019s 53-year-old manager, gave them a gentle scolding.\n\nMs. Repp said she heard about Ohio\u2019s decision to lift the mask mandate on the local news. Now she and the owner are struggling to decide whether to take the signs down or keep them up.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still out there. The Covid-19 is still out there,\u201d she said, adding that she is unvaccinated.\nThe Better Half Family Diner has struggled with whether to remove signs asking customers to wear masks when they aren\u2019t seated.\nJackie Repp, manager at the Better Half diner, says she is mindful that Covid-19 is still a risk.\n\nWhen Mr. Wobser, 42, came back to his hometown in 2014 to become city manager, it was a shadow of the bustling manufacturing city where he grew up. The real-estate crisis had left Sandusky\u2019s historic housing stock empty and worn. Its biggest business was the Cedar Point amusement park on Lake Erie, built in 1870, but the city didn\u2019t have the revenue to build up a tourist economy around it.\n\nThe city underwent a massive tax overhaul aimed at pulling more revenue from Cedar Point admissions, redid Shoreline Drive and turned a parking lot into a city pier. Bars and small businesses started filling in downtown storefronts.\n\n\u201cWe had a lot of great success,\u201d Mr. Wobser said. \u201cBut there\u2019s still this tension. It\u2019s a city reinventing itself but still clearly in transition. This is the backdrop against which Covid-19 happened.\u201d\n\nBy March 2020, Covid-19 had shut down the whole city. Sandusky lost 30% of its general fund overnight. Then Cedar Point delayed its opening and temporarily shut down many of its rides.\n\nPeople started sniping at each other about masks.\n\n\u201cIt was very much a head scratcher when people would selfishly do this whole civil liberties thing,\u201d said Trent Beard, who owns a coffee house downtown. \u201cYou\u2019re already wearing pants and shoes and a shirt, right? No one told you you had to wear them.\u201d\nNewsletter Sign-up\nPolitics Alert\n\nMajor political news, from campaigns to the Capitol.\nSUBSCRIBE\n\nLast year in May, Tim Dorsey, owner of another gym downtown, testified before Ohio\u2019s House Economic Recovery Task Force. A cancer survivor, he questioned the validity of shutting down and restricting businesses, saying he thought people should be able to choose for themselves which restrictions were necessary to keep themselves safe.\n\nPeople emailed and posted angry comments about the testimony. One person told him he should die. He would come to the gym every day during the lockdown but couldn\u2019t bring himself to exercise. He resorted to letting members rent equipment, to keep revenue coming in.\n\n\u201cMy gym was getting picked apart piece by piece,\u201d he said.\n\nThe masks, he said, represent a lot more to him than a piece of fabric. They are a wedge between people. He doesn\u2019t wear one. Around Sandusky, some people see it and express relief, removing theirs, too. Others give him dirty looks.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s just the masks. The narrative across the board seems to align with separation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need connectivity.\u201d\n\nLittle by little, business owners say, people started to gravitate toward the businesses where they felt most comfortable. Soon, Sandusky had a strange split in its economy, with those who supported mask-wearing frequenting businesses with strict rules, and those who didn\u2019t support masks taking their business elsewhere.\nJeff Smith, owner of Sandusky Hardware, says his customers are relieved that they don\u2019t have to wear a mask in his store.\n\nBy the time the CDC came out with its new guidance, mask wearing in Sandusky was already completely different in different establishments\u2014sometimes on the same block.\n\nAt Sandusky Hardware, a few doors down from the diner, owner Jeff Smith, 48, said customers know they don\u2019t need to wear a mask in his store and are relieved that they can let down their guard. Several customers came through unmasked and started talking about the news. As they were talking, two more friends and customers came in without masks, and Mr. Smith called after them, \u201cMasks, please!\u201d eliciting a chuckle from the group.\n\nRyan Whaley, 43, owns interests in several small businesses in the city, including a speakeasy-style bar where the front page of its menu says, \u201cNo politics. No religion. No name dropping.\u201d After Covid-19, some people suggested he add that to the list.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to wear [a mask], you\u2019re welcome to step outside and we can help you there,\u201d Mr. Whaley said. \u201cSome people made a decision to go somewhere else. It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s your perspective.\u201d",

        "Ok it\u2019s a little long so bear with me. While it was an extremely traumatic event, I still consider us lucky because it could\u2019ve been so much worse. We\u2019ll get to that later. I\u2019m on mobile too. \n\nSo it was Memorial Day weekend and I was off the weekend but had to work Monday night. We went up to my parents place at Marblehead, Lake Erie. We came back Monday afternoon, in time for me to get to work. I worked evenings at McDonalds as a manager while going to school for nursing. My husband had been laid off a month prior but was doing Uber and Shipt to make money while he looked for a job. So despite that we were in a good place and things were going well. \n\nAt work that night there was going to be another manager and I knew we were going to be slow so I tried calling off but my boss convinced me to go in because the other manager was still kind of new, even though she was pretty capable of doing her job. I don\u2019t remember the exact time but it was probably around 10pm I started getting notifications on my phone about severe weather and a tornado in the area. Didn\u2019t think much of it. The storms that hit the Dayton area usually produced tiny tornados, something that might shake the leaves off of a tree but nothing major. If anything, the storm might drop a tornado east of the are in the country, like the Xenia tornado of \u201874. I logged into Facebook because we were indeed dead at work and bored. I saw some friends reposting a video of one of the chief meteorologists at a news station basically yelling at the viewers for wanting to get back to the Bachelorette when it was an extremely dangerous situation. I try posting a link to that video later. \n\nI began texting my husband as well as got in contact with my boss. She said there\u2019s a tornado on the ground heading east but she wasn\u2019t sure how big it was. Around 10:45pm we kicked out the 2 customers we had (they were regulars who always came at night for coffee), and closed the restaurant down early. I went outside around 11pm to see what was going on. We knew the tornado was headed forwards the Beavercreek area but tornados will do what they want and could end up wherever. I remember it was windy and there was lots and lots of lightening. I went back inside shortly after and we took shelter in the bathroom. \n\nDuring this time, I was also in contact with my husband. We knew he needed to take cover with the children. The problem was, we didn\u2019t have a basement in our tiny townhouse. He joked about cutting a hole in the wall under the stairs and honestly, that is something I had considered in the past when serious storms came though but never produced anything. \n\nAll of a sudden, he texts me to take shelter. He tells me he loves me and that they\u2019re getting hit. I of course freak out a little bit, hoping that he means just rain. But I can\u2019t get a hold of him. For 45 minutes I wait for word. I try to stay calm, hoping that the worst didn\u2019t happen and maybe there\u2019s just no power or something. Finally we are able to get in contact but the reception is spotty. He says we got hit. I ask how bad it was and he says you need to come home. We can\u2019t live here anymore. Of course I\u2019m like, oh shit, sorry coworkers, I gotta go, we\u2019ve been hit. \n\nI call my boss and tell her my house got hit and I left for the night cuz I gotta get home to my family. I worked less than 2 miles from where I lived. It usually took me 10 minutes at the most to get home. This might it took me over 30 minutes. There were so many large trees, branches, and power lines down, plus it was dark as crap so it was extremely difficult to find my way around. My neighborhood was like 2/3 neighborhoods all connected with multiple ways in and out. All but 1 were blocked. I finally made it to that entrance (I didn\u2019t know it was open, just luck) I parked about a block away from my house just in case my road was bad. The scene was straight out of a movie. It was pitch black but there was still tons and tons of debris everywhere. My first thought was finding my family. I knew they had taken shelter with some neighbors around the corner from us, but I couldn\u2019t remember which house number it was. \n\nFuriously I headed to the area I thought they might be, passing my house/unit. I could barely make out the damage in the dark, but it wouldn\u2019t register till the next day. With the power out the cell service wasn\u2019t great but I managed to find him and my children. Some neighbors let us sit with them while the fire department made sure the gas was off and not a threat. They just had their windows blown out so their house was in much better shape. \n\nI have to get to bed but I\u2019ll post the rest of my story tomorrow and my husbands as well since he actually went though the tornado",

        "Honestly, Nebraska is a great state to drive through if you\u2019re not on I-80. I seriously recommend Hwy 2 or Hwy 12 along with US-20. If you do take I-80, I recommend stopping at the Stuhr Museum of the Prairie Pioneer in Grand Island. They have a section of the Oregon Trail on their property, and the museum has some fantastic art and historical exhibits about life on the Great Plains. The admission is crazy cheap for what you get too.\n\nIf you have time to not take I-80, I definitely recommend taking I-380 or I-35 north (Des Moines has some good restaurants\u2014at least before covid\u2014so it\u2019s a better lunch spot than most Great Plains cities) up to US-20 because it\u2019s much more scenic than I-80 west of Des Moines. Then you follow N-12 from Sioux City to Valentine along the Missouri &amp; Niobrara Rivers across half the state. Ponca, Niobrara, and Smith Falls State Parks are all great stops to take in some of the best scenery on the Great Plains. You will see a part of the Plains that most people wouldn\u2019t even believe is in Nebraska or South Dakota, it\u2019s so gorgeous with the cliffs and rolling hills! I-80 by comparison is incredibly flat. In Valentine you can rent a canoe or tubes to go down the Niobrara River. After Valentine you want to follow US-20 across the Western half of the state where you\u2019ll see a number of random rock outcroppings they call buttes. (Pronounced \u201cbyewt\u201d, the same way you say \u201cshe\u2019s a beaut!\u201d) Chadron &amp; Fort Robinson State Parks are good places to stop and explore a few of these. Fort Robinson has some great historical buildings and a museum with a giant mammoth if you\u2019re into ancient pachyderms.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in even better buttes, go down to the Wildcat Hills around Scottsbluff to see Chimney Rock, Scotts Bluff, and Courthouse &amp; Jail Rocks. You can get to I-25 in Wyoming after stopping at Register Cliff &amp; the Oregon Trail ruts in Guernsey. So Nebraska doesn\u2019t have to be long and boring! It\u2019s honestly one of my favorite Plains States!\n\nWhen you pass through Northern Ohio, I recommend getting off the Ohio Turnpike and checking out Cuyahoga Valley National Park. Brandywine Falls is an easy and scenic stop with a 90 foot waterfall. If you want a longer stop you can hike the trail to Brandywine Falls from the Stanford House or go into Peninsula and rent bicycles to ride the Ohio &amp; Erie Towpath Trail along the old canal and the Cuyahoga River.\n\nIf you want food or beer, go into Cleveland to W 25th Street and try Great Lakes or Market Garden breweries, and visit the historic West Side Market. The Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland is a must see if you\u2019re a huge fan of the music. You can get a scenic view of Lake Erie and the city skyline from Edgewater Park.\n\nCedar Point in Sandusky is a must-stop if you love rollercoasters and can spend a day or at least an evening there. There are all sorts of little state parks to see near here too, like the Marblehead Lighthouse east of Port Clinton.\n\nSW Pennsylvania has a few worthy stops in the Laurel Highlands area\u2014Ohiopyle State Park has a bunch of really nice waterfalls right near town. Frank Lloyd Wright\u2019s Fallingwater is also just north of here outside of town.\n\nSouthern Wyoming does not have a ton of spectacular stops, but you will enjoy a quick stop at the rest area just before Vedauwoo, where there\u2019s a tree growing in a split rock...and then just an exit or two down the road is a giant sculpture of Abraham Lincoln commemorating the old Lincoln Highway that passes through here, as well as a great vista where you can see the traffic meandering its way up the Sherman Summit, which I believe is the highest point on I-80 as well as the First Transcontinental Railroad.\n\nNorthern Indiana and Southern Michigan isn\u2019t the most exciting region to pas through. Indiana Dunes Natl Park is worth a stop though...I think West Beach is the one with the hiking trail that goes over a big dune to the beach.\n\nAlso...if you want to see Chicago, it\u2019s fine if you\u2019re somewhere Downtown. I\u2019m in Greater Cleveland and I\u2019ve made several weekend trips there and I never once felt unsafe there in the tourist areas in Near North or The Loop. The southern edge of the South Loop seemed a little sketchy, but if you\u2019re up near Michigan &amp; Wacker, you\u2019re going to be fine to check out the city. I just don\u2019t know how much of it will be open with the pandemic...so I\u2019d probably recommend it for another trip. It\u2019s easiest to get across town in the evening after 7:30-8pm...traffic is bad through here from 6-7am all the way through the end of the afternoon rush. Cleveland has rush hours too, but you\u2019ll never notice them if you\u2019re used to East Coast city traffic. Chicagoland has the worst traffic of the entire trip though.",

        "This question shows up on here somewhat frequently, but it's an apples to oranges comparison. It really depends on the lifestyle you're interested.  They're just not similar and there are goods and bads to both.  Either way, $800 will not get you much in terms of rent in either City.  FWIW Kingston is probably better if you don't have a car.  \n\nHere is my response to a previous poster:  \n\n\\---\n\nLondon and Kingston are both great cities, and which city is right for you is really a subjective decision. I grew up in London and have lived in Kingston for about 9 years. I love them both for different reasons.\r  \n\r  \nSize:\r  \n\r  \nLondon is a big city, and you will enjoy big city amenities. The one thing I miss the most about London is the access to shopping, entertainment, and culture. Kingston is smaller, so you will enjoy less hustle and bustle, less traffic, and a generally slower pace. First question you can ask yourself is are you looking to move to a bigger, or smaller city? If you're in Kingston and you really need your fix of city life, Ottawa is 2 hours up the road.\r  \n\r  \nClimate\r  \n\r  \nLondon is surrounded by the great lakes, and consequently, it is very humid. The summers are hot, hazy and humid, and the winter's chill seems to reach your bones, owing to the dampness. London is also in the middle of a snow belt. Do you like snow? Kingston, on the other hand is a bit milder year round. Less snow in the winter, and fewer days in the summer where the temperature exceeds 30 degrees.\r  \n\r  \nConsider what your favourite activities are. London has a small ski-hill and is surrounded by several world-class sandy freshwater beaches on Lake Erie and Lake Huron. The Thames river traverses the entire city, with a network of bike paths along its banks. You can bike clear across the city without having to ride on city streets. Kingston is situated directly on Lake Ontario. You see people enjoying the water all summer and in the winter you'll find people ice fishing. Just north of the city are beautiful hiking trails and hundreds of pristine freshwater lakes. Do you prefer shopping or lazing around on a beach on a hot summer day? Go to London. If you prefer hiking and taking in the sights of the peaceful crystal clear freshwater lakes? Go to Kingston.\r  \n\r  \nKingston is a beautiful city, much more picturesque than London. It seems safer, with less violent crime, and commutes are virtually non-existent. No matter where you live in Kingston, you can get to work in 20 minutes or less.\r  \n\r  \nTransit\r  \n\r  \nKingston has a decent public transit system. If you end up going to london and think you are going to use transit.. don't. just don't. The city was offered funding from the provincial and federal governments to bring in light rail transit, but several prominent business owners were able to influence city council to vote it down because the construction would be too disruptive...\r  \n\r  \nHere's why London wins in my books:\r  \n\r  \nLondon is more alive--it has more of a \"pulse\" to it. It has a better night life, and an abundance of park space. Several big concerts come to London and there are more options for recreation. Kingston is comparatively boring.\r  \n\r  \nThere are so many cool, charming neighbourhoods in London. Towns that have been annexed into the city have retained their identities, and feel like small towns on their own. Look into Wortly Villiage, Byron, Lambeth, Arva. They are little pockets in the city with their own little \"main strips.\" Even if you aren't into the the big-city life, but would still like to have access, there are several smaller cities on the outskirts, such as St. Thomas, Strathroy, and Woodstock\r  \n\r  \nLondon has a diversified economy, meaning whatever industry you work in, it'll be easier for you to find work, especially in the tech, finance, and manufacturing sectors. Several large companies are headquartered there.",

        "Having naval dominance of the seas was not enough for the British to send it's ships elsewhere.   They were still needed off the European shores to block merchant vessels bringing supplies to Napoleon and his allies.   They were also required to maintain naval supremacy by preventing their opponents from rebuilding their own navies.  It was only after the Continental war was over that the might of the British Navy could be released and sent to the American shores. \n\n\nOnce the British ships had been released they were free to sail to America and gain control of the North American Coasts.  Thus, The USS Enterprise had been  trapped in  Boston by a British squadron blockading the harbour.  It would have sat there for the rest of the war, rendered impotent, but a chance storm forced the British squadron to move off shore for safety .  With the British blockade moved to safer waters offshore the Enterprise was able to escape her prison. \n\nWhen she did see action the Enterprise had superior firepower to her quarry.   The Enterprise had thirty 24 pounder long guns in its armament.   The HMS Cyane and Levant had one each. Instead the British ships had smaller cannons designed for short range fighting.    The range and size differences in armament could be roughly compared to the Americans using a trebuchet while the British threw rocks back at them.   If they could not escape the Brit's only had two choices - be battered to bits or surrender. \n\n\nOn Lake Erie the Lawrence and Niagara were built in Prequel Bay.   The bay had a shallow sand bar across the entrance which slowed their passage into the lake.   The British had blockaded the bay with a fleet of ships hovering around the entrance to the harbour.   But the Captain of the squadron made a tragic error.   Believing that the large American warships were too deep to clear the harbour,  Barclay sailed back to Canada to attend a banquet held in his honour. \n\nWith the British ships away the Americans attached sealed scows called mules to their warships.   These mules were filled with water and attached to the ships.   Once attached they were pumped out and provided the extra buoyancy needed to float the warships over  the sandbar. \n\nThe two sides on Lake Erie had fleets of roughly  equal size and numbers.   The major differences between them was in armament and the sailors experience.   In 1813 the British needed all of its able seamen in the Atlantic aiding it's war on Continental Europe.   On the Canadian Great Lakes only one in four British sailors had any experience as a sailor and a smaller percentage had naval experience or training while seventy-five percent of  American sailors were experienced sailors. \n\nThe American ships had short range cannonade for armament.   These guns had a short range but could be fired at a devastatingly rapid rate of fire.   The British ships had long guns which were extremely effective at long range but slow to fire.   Their other guns were a mismatched hodgepodge of outdated cannons deemed unnecessary to Britain's Navy in the Atlantic.   They were of different sizes,  design and many had corroded firing tubes which reduced their rate of fire.   Where the American ships all used the same sized shot and powder charges the British needed to sort their shot and charges before loading.   The British were at a further disadvantage as all of their supplies had to be imported from Britain and shipped across the Atlantic and up the St Lawrence River to the Great Lakes.   Many supplies and sailors destined for Barclay on Lake Erie never arrived,  instead they were commandeered by General Provost who felt that his defense of Lake Ontario was more import. \n\n\n\nWhen the two fleets did meet in battle the Americans almost lost.   Pounded by the British long range guns Commander Perry raised a white flag to surrender his flagship Lawrence and moved his command over to the Niagara.  The Niagara then became the focus of all of the British guns.  It too might very well have been defeated except for the intervention of fate. \n\nThe two main British ships were the Queen Charlotte and the Detroit.   All of the senior officers on board the Queen Charlotte died during the battle.  The surviving officer had no experience with large sailing ships or battle tactics.   He moved in close behind the Detroit and took the wind out of her sails.   When the Detroit turned to get back into the wind Robert Irving on the Queen Charlotte followed suit and the Two ships collided.   With their masts tangled and both ships unable to maneuver they became sitting ducks for Perry and his lethal short range cannonade.   They had no option but to surrender.  Once the British Capital ships had surrendered the rest of the smaller British ships had no choice but to follow suit.",

        "SPC AC 091251\n\n   Day 1 Convective Outlook  \n   NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK\n   0751 AM CDT Fri Apr 09 2021\n\n   Valid 091300Z - 101200Z\n\n   ...THERE IS A MODERATE RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PORTIONS OF\n   SOUTHERN ARKANSAS...NORTHERN LOUISIANA...CENTRAL MISSISSIPPI...AND\n   WESTERN ALABAMA...\n\n   ...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS SEPARATELY OVER\n   PARTS OF SOUTHERN VIRGINIA AND NORTHERN NORTH CAROLINA...\n\n   ...SUMMARY...\n   Multiple episodes of severe thunderstorms are expected today from\n   parts of eastern Oklahoma and north-central/northeast Texas, across\n   the Mid-South and Mississippi Delta regions, to parts of Alabama and\n   Georgia.  This includes a threat for a swath of severe wind from \n   Arkansas across the lower Mississippi Valley.  Large, damaging hail\n   and tornadoes also are possible.\n\n   ...Synopsis...\n   In mid/upper levels, a split-flow pattern will be maintained over\n   the central CONUS, as one cyclone ejects out of a broader-scale\n   trough causing the split, and another takes its place.  The leading\n   cyclone -- initially centered near LSE -- is forecast to weaken\n   gradually to an open-wave trough and head northeastward over Upper\n   MI and Lake Superior overnight.  Upstream, a strong shortwave trough\n   was apparent in moisture-channel imagery from eastern MT southward\n   to central CO.  This feature will dig southeastward across the\n   central Plains today and this evening, before pivoting eastward\n   tonight as a closed cyclone, across parts of the lower Missouri\n   Valley.  By 12Z, the associated 500-mb low should be located near\n   the KS/MO line south of MKC.\n\n   Farther south, a broad area of strong cyclonic flow aloft will\n   spread eastward across the outlook area, with embedded, closely\n   spaced perturbations now evident over southwestern/central NM and\n   the TX Panhandle.  These perturbations will move across OK and south\n   TX today.  Tonight, they should reach parts of TN/MS/LA, likely\n   blending into convectively generated vorticity fields.  The broad\n   left-exit region of a cyclonically curved, 250-mb subtropical jet,\n   also exhibiting pronounced difluence, also will shift eastward over\n   much of central/north TX and LA today and tonight toward the Delta\n   region.\n\n   At the surface, 11Z analysis showed an occluded, elongated area of\n   low pressure across northwestern WI to northern IA.  An occluded\n   front was drawn from the northern part across Lake Superior and\n   Lower MI, with weakening/quasistationary front across western OH,\n   eastern portions of TN/KY, and northern AL.  A warm front extended\n   across Lake Erie, eastern WV, and southwestern/southern VA near the\n   NC line.  This boundary will move slowly northward over southern/\n   central VA today.  A cold front extended across southern IA,\n   northwestern MO, central/western KS, and southeastern CO.  A\n   marine/warm front extended from a low over northwest TX across\n   north-central TX, central LA, and southern portions of MS/AL. This\n   boundary will move northward across southern /eastern OK, AR, and\n   central MS/AL through the day.\n\n   The northern low should consolidate in form but continue to fill,\n   and move northeastward over ON.  Meanwhile, a second low is expected\n   to develop along the front today near the dryline intersection,\n   perhaps evolving out of the initial/prefrontal low over northwest\n   TX.  The resulting low should deepen as the next mid/upper cyclone\n   approaches, and move northeastward to near STL by 12Z tomorrow.  By\n   that time, the cold front should extend from the low southward down\n   the Mississippi Valley to near BTR, then southwestward across\n   mid/upper TX coastal waters to deep south TX.\n\n   ...Southern Plains to Arklatex/Mid-South/Delta regions...\n   Episodes of severe thunderstorms are expected today into this\n   evening between eastern OK, north TX and Mississippi, resulting in\n   large (locally very large) hail, severe gusts and several tornadoes.\n\n   This is a complex scenario with an assortment of mesoscale\n   possibilities more diverse than the number of models and ensemble\n   members available.  Progs somewhat inconsistently depict early\n   initiation and evolution of the convection across this region,\n   whether near the front in OK (a very plausible consensus theme), on\n   the dryline (more isolated/conditional due to strong capping), and\n   in the warm sector (highly variable).  Multiple episodes of\n   strong-severe thunderstorms may move over any given spot through\n   tonight.  This outlook represents both:\n   1.  The potential for overlapping areas of severe at different times\n   through the day and evening as different areas of convection evolve,\n   but also:\n   2.  A scenario that most progs reasonably do converge upon despite\n   early differences:  a dominant QLCS/MCS evolving out of convection\n   initiating in OK and/or northeast TX, then moving east-southeastward\n   to southeastward over the Arklatex to Delta regions, organizing a\n   well-developed cold pool, and producing a swath of severe wind.\n\n   **Whether or not this event will qualify as a derecho is a semantic\n   exercise, and likely regulated by mesoscale convective/boundary\n   processes yet to become apparent.** Regardless, hurricane-force\n   convective gusts are a threat with any such complex, in the Enhanced\n   and Moderate areas.  Also, because both the probable QLCS and any\n   preceding supercell(s) will encounter an environment of moderate-\n   strong buoyancy, steep midlevel lapse rates around the eastern rim\n   of an EML, enlarged low-level hodographs, and favorable vertical\n   shear, tornadoes also are expected.  Peak preconvective MLCAPE\n   across the warm sector commonly should be in the 2000-3000 J/kg\n   range, amidst 40-55-kt effective-shear magnitudes.  As one or more\n   MCSs plow cold pools into this environment, they should be\n   maintained southeastward toward southern MS/AL tonight, continuing a\n   wind-damage and sporadic tornado threat.\n\n   ...Central Gulf Coast to AL/GA this morning/afternoon...\n   Widely scattered to scattered thunderstorms should develop from\n   mid/late morning through this afternoon, with a threat for sporadic\n   large hail and damaging gusts.  A conditional, localized tornado\n   threat also may develop.  For near-term coverage, please see SPC\n   mesoscale discussion 338.\n\n   Midlevel lapse rates will be less than in the more EML-influenced\n   air mass of the Plains/Delta area.  Still, rich low-level moisture\n   spreading inland, combined with areas of diurnal heating (tempered\n   in pace by mid/upper cloud cover from upstream convection), will\n   weaken MLCINH and yield favorable surface-based buoyancy. \n   Meanwhile, low-level shear will be maximized near the marine frontal\n   zone, though weak absolute speeds will limit hodograph size\n   somewhat.  Modified 12Z RAOBs and forecast soundings from midday\n   through afternoon indicate around 1500-2000 J/kg MLCAPE is possible,\n   with 35-45 kt effective-shear magnitudes. Effective SRH will range\n   from around 200-250 J/kg on the front to around 100-1-50 J/kg\n   coastward in the warm sector.  With upper support meager in this\n   area, but also modest MLCINH, convective coverage along and south of\n   the front is uncertain.\n\n   ...VA/NC...\n   Widely scattered to scattered thunderstorms should form this\n   afternoon over higher terrain near the eastern WV Panhandle and VA\n   Blue Ridge, with additional convection developing later in the\n   afternoon and evening southward across portions of western NC.  This\n   activity is expected to move eastward across much of NC and VA,\n   offering isolated large hail and the potential for damaging to\n   marginally severe gusts.  A tornado cannot be ruled out, especially\n   with any convection that can interact with the front, where weak but\n   also backed surface winds will enhanced low-level hodograph size and\n   boundary-layer bulk shear.  Modest low/middle-level winds will limit\n   deep shear, with effective-shear magnitudes generally 20-35 kt in\n   most areas, perhaps around 40 kt along the front.  As such, mostly\n   multicell modes are expected, with isolated, transient supercell\n   character possible near the front.\n\n   Convection in the northern parts of the outlook area will be tied\n   more strictly to orographic processes, and will have a much narrower\n   zone of favorable instability to access, north of the warm front. \n   That convection should weaken within a short distance eastward of\n   their initial flare-up.  However, activity across central/southern\n   VA into central NC should persist well into the evening, perhaps as\n   far eastward as the Tidewater areas from Hampton roads toward the\n   northern sounds of NC, before weakening in the ongoing nocturnal/\n   boundary-layer stabilization process.  Surface dew points mid 50s to\n   low 60s F, beneath steep low/middle-level lapse rates, will support\n   pockets of 1000-1500 J/kg MLCAPE along and south of the front, atop\n   a well-mixed afternoon boundary layer supporting potential for\n   strong/isolated severe gusts and hail to reach the surface.\n\n   ..Edwards/Broyles.. 04/09/2021",

        "My attempt at a translation:\n\n&gt; Detroit, Michigan, sunday 10/19/1924, in the morning\n&gt; \n&gt; My dear, sweet comrad Ellen!\n&gt; \n&gt; I am sitting at the window of our room on the 7th floor of the YMCA building. Opposite me, Paul S\u00fc\u00df is working on a sample drawing for Ford, that is going to be delivered tomorrow.\n&gt; In these last days, I have very often looked at this beautiful square that is framed by skyscrapers so harmonically. Its cleanlyness, the green areas, the massive beauty of the scenery even when traffic is at its peak and the magic brightness of the streets and advertisments, without being as screaming [loud, obnoxious?] as New York - this beauty and pleasantness is not only part of this square, but of the entire city of Detroit. It is a pleasure to stay in this city.\n&gt; And we have had a lot of pleasure and success here until now, and we will be able to return knowing that the trip was well worth it. And it's not monday night yet!\n&gt; Ellen, often since I departed I wished: If only Ellen was here now! On the mountain train ride along Lahigh River, where we went through tunnels and along steep slopes, and finally we were at the very top of the ridge between Lehigh and Susuehanna Valley, 900 meters high, from where the train creeped down in endless serpentines, along the slope until we finally crossed the main road of Wilkes Barre - a town that we had previously seen like toys to our feet. It was dark when we arrived in Buffalo. The ride on the tram to Niagara Falls took one hour. From there, we strolled into Canada, and opposite us, lit by the moon and spotlights, like liquid silver, we saw the water pushing toward us and suddenly falling and diving into the snow white mist of its own dust. [oh boy...]\n&gt; \n&gt; And then the beautiful night on Lake Erie - moon, seagulls and the gurgling of the water - and finally the nice little cabin - you scaredy-cat! What? - and in general, your humor! your lack of logic, and Griseldchens babbling starting starting at 6 am! Last night after the show Paul S\u00fc\u00df and I where sitting together and we agreed that the next trip would be done with wifes and kids - but preferably to Bermuda if it's in the winter! Are you looking forward to that, darling? You know, when I set my mind to something, and you remind me so I don't forget, then it will happen!\n&gt; \n&gt; Now for your \"have to letter\" [no idea]. From end to end it is so wittily YOU, that I immensely enjoyed it just for that fact alone. Thank you, scaredy-cat! Write to Sears Roebuck Co., that you didn't order the chair (and me neither) and that there must be a mistake, and if we are owed any money, they can kindly send us a check. To Jacobs Juc., I will send a letter and a check from here. Have the baby buggy wheels done! We will not get a new buggy for $2.60, even if your name is Ellen Jung and you now have a daughter called Griseldis!\n&gt; \n&gt; Then there is an unfinished sentence in your letter because Paul is doing something. But what? I cannot read whether he bites you in the cheek or in the jacket. How would that work with the jacket? Or the cheeks? I will have to have a private conversation with Paul once I am home.\n&gt; \n&gt; You cannot call Uncle Ferdinand's letter \"bitterly mean\", at least not when you try to understand his point of view, which obviously noone can ever fully understand. But at least I will now talk to him in person under your supervision to tell him my point of view. Which is, in tall letters: YOU WERE RIGHT! The lesson for the future, if you and Paul disagree again, will be that I shall view your point of view as the better one. And anyway, whenever it's about exploring a matter with one's feelings, you are - as many of your fellow women - definitely superior to us!\n&gt; \n&gt; Did you finish the letter to my mother? Thanks my dear girl! I wrote home, too. Will you also think of Otto Sp.? - Don't let your Folks boss you around; they all have to be kind to you! You will tell me about everyone's behavior.\n&gt; \n&gt; Has ??? found work? Hopefully, because Willi wants to make money. And what about Oda? Did she come closer to marriage? Paul needs to [don't know the German word], every beginning is hard! Send everyone my regards, dear! And our K\u00fcppi-Putzchen [some term of endearment]? Well, what am I supposed to ask there? I'll have to wait until I'm home!\n&gt; \n&gt; See you! On thursday, probably! Write only to Cleveland + YMCA Niagara Falls.\n&gt; Regards and many kisses.\n&gt; Yours, Walther",

        "Hi! I'm a freelance illustrator (paying the bills!) and I had the worst case of undiagnosed ADHD my doc had ever seen when I finally gained access to care. Aside from meds, there are a lot of strategies I employ to keep myself um... employed!\n\n - Probably the biggest one is making sure I have enough projects to keep me interested (so I can bounce between things) while having not so many projects going so that I don't get burnt out. I've found that I definitely have \"stages\" throughout the day/with my medication especially where it's easier to get admin work done, or rough work, or \"sit down and just do the thing for a couple hours\" work, and I try to have at least one project in every \"stage\" so I can bounce back to it when it's time for rough ideas or final touches or whatever. \n - My focus and concentration is SHIT. It's taken a couple years to nail down exactly how my brain works and then how I can make work work for my brain. It's a lot of trial and error, but I've found breaking things into TINY chunks (idk how smithing works and what kind of time constraints the medium has, but I bet there's ways to \"chunk\" it up!) is super duper helpful.\n - Getting materials out? is the HARDEST thing! If you can afford the space, I've found it super helpful to just have everything out and ready to go.\n - OUTSOURCE as much as you can! All the little administrative tasks add up fast. Deadlines, client emails, freaking social media, whatever. If you've got cash, you can pay for an assistant, but if you don't you can outsource a lot of that executive function to calendars, pre-set alarms, call in favors from friends (thank you friend for helping me with my website because WOW that's hard!), scheduling social media posts ahead of time (I use Later)... The admin bullshit will ALWAYS add up and be there and will eat all your time if you let it (even for neurotypical people, ESPECIALLY for ADHD brains!), so make everything that's not actually smithing as easy and routine as possible so you can put it on autopilot.\n - It gets shared everywhere in creative circles, but if you haven't seen this chart: https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/9d1074fe-77ca-48b8-acc2-09e5215cedae/d5g8bt8-f176245c-c1bc-4cab-8e0d-0c20194f661f.png?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOiIsImlzcyI6InVybjphcHA6Iiwib2JqIjpbW3sicGF0aCI6IlwvZlwvOWQxMDc0ZmUtNzdjYS00OGI4LWFjYzItMDllNTIxNWNlZGFlXC9kNWc4YnQ4LWYxNzYyNDVjLWMxYmMtNGNhYi04ZTBkLTBjMjAxOTRmNjYxZi5wbmcifV1dLCJhdWQiOlsidXJuOnNlcnZpY2U6ZmlsZS5kb3dubG9hZCJdfQ.cmitcg7i_tjtEMirMr8caCPECautOi_Mu264jYSJC6w it could be the cause of a lot of your frustration with \"can't concentrate long enough to get good\". A lot of that frustration, both in myself and in people I taught, is really just being frustrated that you're 'seeing' at a higher level than your skills are at right now. It's frustrating as all heck because nothing you make seems to, in your eyes, look good right now. But honestly it's a good thing!! (I know, I know, it's hard as heck being there (and I could stand to take my own advice at the moment, honestly)) It means you have the ability to see your mistakes and make them better and your skills are most likely about to skyrocket!\n\nBeing an artist with an ADHD brain is undoubtedly hard as fuck. I won't deny that! But honestly? almost every job with ADHD is hard as fuck. It 100% sucks, and you have every right to feel frustrated. But it IS doable! I know this was a giant info dump, and may not have been asked for (if you just need to vent, please disregard!), but my inbox is always open if you'd like to chat about making it as an artist with an ADHD brain!",

        "**Today, April 17th is the launch day for the pink-haired secretary extraordinaire of the Eagle Union, USS Memphis (CL-13).**\n___\n\nOne of the first duties Memphis performed in her service to the USN was the dedication of the American memorial gateway recognizing Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry, an American admiral noted for his success against the British and Canadian forces at the Lake Erie campaign of the war of 1812.\n ___\n[Imgur Biography on Memphis.](https://imgur.com/a/9NhGXiM)\n___\n Throughout Memphis's life, she embarked many famed people. This would include US President Calvin Coolidge, Alfonso XIII (the last Spanish king), and aviation pioneer Charles A. Lindbergh. She even carried the very plane Lindbergh used in his famous nonstop Transatlantic flight, \"The Spirit of St. Louis,\" from Paris to Washington DC. She also flew Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u2019s flag at the Casablanca conference of 1943 and was present for his final conference at Yalta. President Amezaga of Uruguay and President Get\u00falio Vargas of Brazil also toured the ship. Both were critical figures in allowing the Allied powers to keep control of the South Atlantic from German U-boats. The highest-ranking officers in the USN and US Army, Fleet Admiral Ernest J. King and General of the Army George C. Marshall, visited Memphis at the same time. Vice Admiral James L. Kaufman, Navy Cross recipient, was her commanding officer in 1936.\n\nIt seems Brooklyn has company in terms of diplomatic expertise.\n\n___\n\n[Fanart of Memphis sightseeing in traveling wear by syr25mc888](https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/84089669)\n___\n\nOutside of being a diplomatic vessel, Memphis, in comparison to other warships at the time, had a very peaceful career in WW2. She escorted convoys in the South Atlantic for much of the war. She made her home base at Recife, Brazil, which allowed her to do patrols there. Notably, she escorted two Army transports to Ascension Island. The US Army 38th Engineer General Service Regiment disembarked, constructing an airport as a staging point for planes flying from the US to Africa.\n\nUSS Memphis was present for the first anniversary of the Allied landings at St. Raphael and St. Tropez in southern France on August 15th, and the Navy Day festivities in Naples, Italy, on October 27th. In November 1945, Memphis departed Tangier for Philadelphia, where she was decommissioned on December 17th. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on January 8th, 1946, and was sold to Patapsco Scrap Co. in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania on December 18th, for scrapping following delivery on January 10th, 1947.\n\n___\n\n**USS Memphis (CL-13) turns ninety-seven years old today.**\n\n___\n\n**If AL\u2019s Memphis was more like her IRL counterpart.**\n\n___\n\n- Memphis's hull number in the ship description on global and Japanese servers should be corrected to CL-13.\n\n- Memphis should have lines added to her Casual Vacation skin describing how she liked to enjoy walks on the beaches of AL\u2019s Brazil during her tour of duty there.\n\n- In turn, she should ask Brooklyn to help her get a tan.\n\n- Memphis should mention how she's met many famous people in her career, which are too numerous for her to list right away. She should also mention that she ferried the \"Spirit of St. Louis\" back to the Eagle Union after its successful flight to Paris.\n\n___\n\nWith a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 like hers, Memphis is legitimately one of the most qualified ship girls to be your secretary. You can bet Manjuu did Memphis justice as she keeps tabs on your fleet and you to ensure that things proceed well.\n\nShe will ensure that you're able to do your job well and will be quick to remind you to work hard should you slip up, as she does not like things to be slowed down.\n\nAs you get closer to her, after earning her trust, you'll find Memphis a playful if a bit prideful girl that likes to toot her own horn at her success and has an excellent ability to keep things in good order. When she especially wants to have fun around Halloween, she'll don a witch's costume and help hunt for candy to fill up her stores.\n\nBut while that day is yet to come this year, today give your perfect secretary a nice cake and party to appreciate all the flawless work she has done for the fleet and you, because everyone needs a good assistant to keep them on their toes. Don't worry; she'll ensure you're able to guarantee the party's success, as she already cleared today's schedule.\n\n___\n\n**Please share and discuss any details and stories you have for Memphis today.**",

Sea Spice Lime - A Seaworthy Scent](http://imgur.com/a/rWsnT4W)\n\n\nSpearhead Shaving is a relative newcomer to the wetshaving world.\u00a0 Founded in 2019 in glorius Dayton Ohio Spearhead is a family run business operated by Dennis (u/Ironbeard_SYS) and his wife with the occasional help from their daughters. Spearhead began out of a passion for wetshaving and blogging and its roots still show in Spearhead's product writeups which are some of the best in the business. Spearhead forst hit the market with a modernized\u00a0 Gillette Khaki reproduction case. And then revived the historic Seaforth!\u00a0shaving brand. In collaboration with Shawn Maher (u/hawns) of Chatillon Lux Speahead!\u00a0 has revived and modernized two Seaforth! scents with one more on the way.\n\nThe latest development in the Seaforth! line is *Sea* *Spice* *Lime* another out of production classic brought back to life. The orginal S.S.L which launced in 1966 was light and vibrant and, Spearhead's take on the scent keeps that fresh spirit. After finding out I was located just down the road from Spearhead HQ Dennis kindly offered to send a sample tub of *Sea* *Spice* *Lime* to me for my thoughts on the fragrance.\n\nThe scent of S.S.L.\u00a0 contains notes of lime, salty ocean, cedarwood, pink pepper, coriander, and West Indies bay.\n\n*Sea*\u00a0 *Spice*\u00a0 *Lime* is light and pleasant off the puck but does not reveal its true nature until well whipped up. Once lathered this is an adventurous scent as vast as the sea. The bright duo of fresh lime and sharp pink pepper open the scent while up above an expansive note of salty sea air sets the backdrop for the rest of the fragrance. The lime and pepper meld into a strong and warm heart of cedarwood which is punctuated by a gritty combination of coriander and West Indies bay both which are tempered to the exact perfect proportion to accentuate the fragrance as a whole without becoming overly spiced like so many\u00a0 bay scents. As the coriander and bay roll away like the tide out to sea, all that remains is the fresh and simple note of ocean air.\u00a0 \n\nSimply put: *Sea* *Spice* *Lime* is an absolute winner.\n\nI followed my shave up with B&amp;M's Reserve Waves which plays quite well with S.S.L.'s overall structure but I am partial to dickholing and would like to try the aftershave splash as those tend to express the fragrance\u00a0 more openly than soaps and balms.\n\nI do not have an ingredients list for S.S.L., but I was told it is in the same 20.1 base as *Heather* and *Spiced* and so I assume it has the same ingredients which are listed as: Stearic Acid, Water, Beef Tallow, Glycerin, Potassium Hydroxide, Castor Oil, Fragrance, Sodium Hydroxide, Murumuru Butter, Xylitol, Lanolin, Jojoba Oil, Shea Butter, Agave Tequilana Leaf Extract\n\n*Sea* *Spice* *Lime* doesn't let down in the performance department.\u00a0\u00a0 20.1 is not the quickest lathering soap I have used, but once frothed it provides fantastic slickness and cushion, with more than enough post pass slickness for touchups. The lather visually reminds me of what I get from Wholly Kaws Tallow base but does not provide the quite the same luxurious post shave feel. \n\n\nEvery time I lather up *Sea* *Spice* *Lime* I find I have forgotten what an amazing scent it is. I have never traditionally enjoyed aquatic scents but S.S.L. has earned its way into one of my favorite scents for the warmer months. It manages a clever balance of fresh and warm with the perfect aquatic and bay notes for summer up at Lake Erie here in Ohio. I am excited to try the splash and hopefully edt when *Sea* *Spice* *Lime* drops in May.",

        "The year is 2023. The KD-is-back Warriors have broken the single season win record with 74-8 after picking up Blake Griffin for 32$/mo at the trade deadline. Steph and KD are both scoring exactly 31.2 ppg each, due to Kerr's new forced sharing policy of not letting the team's highest scorer shoot until someone else catches up. The nets subreddit is shut down in protest of their ownership trading KD for a package reigning DPOY Andrew Wiggins and James Wiseman. \n\nAfter a hard fought WCF loss the year before LeBron James has decided to buy the Cleveland Cavaliers franchise. His first decision as LeGM was to trade Sexton, Garland, and 20 future draft picks for Himself, Chris Paul, and Carmelo Anthony. They trio meets up with Dwyane Wade in Toronto where the local LeBron fan club has custom built a giant wooden banana boat. Just as the four begin to depart Alex Caruso, who had been hiding in LeBron James' suitcase the entire time, jumps into the final seat. The team paddles across Lake Erie down to Ohio where they proceed to win 32 games, good for 8th seed in the east. \n\nOubre is now on a two way contract with the Warriors, averaging 28 seconds per game. He has demanded that the ownership \"only play him in the hype minutes\" where the score is close in the final 5 minutes. This has only happened in two games, both against the newly rebuilding lakers.  \n\nThe two teams meet in the finals after historic dual 12-0 runs. LeBron, now 7'2\" after a late growth spurt, is averaging 48/12/22. As the first game is about to begin, LeBron announces his retirement under the condition that Jordan fans all admit he's the goat if he wins. As the first game starts the warriors reveal Kerr's latest revolutionary offensive scheme, dubbed the friendship circle. Every player on the Warriors roster scored 12 points while playing energized defense, leading to a 120-72 victory.  With all the saved energy from reducing his scoring load Blake Griffin is now averaging 6 blocks and 18 rebounds per game. The Cavaliers suffer two more harsh losses, 110-65 and 140-83. Lebron has shattered Jordan's scoring record with 70, but Skip Bayless says he is beginning to question whether LeBron really has that killer instinct. Game 4 starts 70-24, LeBron heads to the locker room feeling slightly less sad than the Celtics in 2016-17. His teammates, having already given up, start to pour each other shots of Hennessey. \n\nAfter a 15 minute delay, officials check the locker room only to see black smoke and pentagrams on the lockers. Just as the officials are about to call the game a forfeit, LeBron James, now 11 feet tall with wings, crashes through the roof of the stadium. Two of the officials begin to question whether LeBron might be taking human growth hormone, but are both quickly fired by Adam Silver. LeBron proceeds to score 85 points over the next 19 minutes to cut the lead to 120-109. 5 minutes left.\n\nKelly Oubre takes off his hoodie and calls on Kerr to sub him in. Kerr, desperate, agrees. \n\nThe fans, who have all but given up hope, see their former FMVP Kelly Oubre walk on stage. His energy breathes life into the Arena. With their newly energized defense the warriors manage to hold LeBron to 74 FG%, and the additional stops have raised the team's true shooting percentage by 14.8% - just enough to keep them in the game. LeBron, clearly out of breath, demands his health team bring him lamb blood and wolfsbane. As LeBron beings to sprout a second set of arms the teams continue to battle it out to the last possession. 150-149 warriors, 2 seconds on the clock, the warriors starting center Alen Smailagic fouls LeBron on the drive. LeBron steps up to the line. Oubre begins to wiggle his legs, but LeBron knows his tricks. LeBron laughs as he drains the first free throw. \n\nHowever, LeBron looks back. Oubre hasn't flinched. No reaction, he continues to look straight ahead, wiggling his knees all the same. The pure matador energy radiating from this man captures the entire audience. The stadium is dead silent. LeBron shoots his second shot free throw and it rims out. The stadium goes berserk, ESPN's analysts are crowning Oubre the new goat while actual analysts mention that missing 1 free throw out of 2 is fairly common for a 70% free throw shooter. Kerr, questioning everything he knows about basketball, decides to let Curry play an extra 30 seconds over his alotted rotation schedule in overtime. Oubre goes 1-4 but Curry scores 20 in the final 3 minutes and the warriors win anyways. Twitter is seeing a suspicious trend of newly created accounts near SF tweeting #KDsweptLeBronTWICE. Michael Jordan releases a documentary about how he would've won if it were him. Draymond gets FMVP for holding LeBron to 83/22/40",

        "I live in Indiana in a college town (pop. ~70k or so) about a 4hr drive southeast of Chicago, and about 2hrs drive west of Dayton, OH (if that helps give you an idea of where I live without me saying exactly where haha.)\n\nI\u2019ve actually been to most states except Alaska and Hawaii I think. I might be missing at least one or two in the 48 contiguous but without wracking (racking??) my brain I can\u2019t be totally sure.\n\nWhen I was a kid I lived in Texas, which is already bigger than France so if you\u2019ve lived in Texas and traversed it at all, you\u2019ve already seen a good portion of the country haha. In fact there\u2019s a saying: \u201cOnce you\u2019re out of Texas, you\u2019re halfway to anywhere.\u201d I spent half my childhood in Houston and then the other half in south texas which is like a totally different climate, basically tropical. It\u2019s also a COMPLETELY different culture and you will hear Spanish literally every day there. So already that\u2019s different cultures and landscape!!\n\nMy dad\u2019s side of the family lived in Miami, Florida, so it was almost a yearly thing that we\u2019d take an road trip there, so I\u2019ve been to all the states en route that direction. \n\nIn my early 20s I was in a band that toured basically everywhere in the Midwest, southeast,  and eastward from that. (FYI, the \u201cMidwest\u201d is oddly not at all west, and I really don\u2019t know why it\u2019s called that haha. It basically starts in the center of the country and goes east.) So, almost every state east of I wanna say Kansas.\n\nAgain, really cool scenery changes there, really pretty, but still not the PRETTIEST of the US I\u2019ve seen. \n\nBeen to a few different places as a kid: I think that\u2019s when I\u2019ve been in Colorado and the Pacific Northwest (Oregon and Washington.) Damn gorgeous. \n\nAs for my FAVORITE sites I\u2019ve seen: So my husband used to live in San Francisco, CA before moving back home to Indiana when we got married. We\u2019ve made the 4-day drive from Indiana to CA at least three times together and each time chose a different route, so we\u2019ve gone a northern route through the dakotas and the badlands (holy shit the badlands are unforgettable) and the southeast (likewise beautiful, went to the Grand Canyon on that trip) and straight through the middle through the plains, which he HATES and says are so boring but I disagree. I\u2019ve seen the salt flats on these trips too. They\u2019re seriously amazing and I love how people stop and leave messages in them. \n\nLastly I finally got to drive to New England in 2019. I had already been to New Hampshire and a little of Maine since my uncle lives in NH, but never really just explored it. So my husband and I drove to Pennsylvania to see Lake Erie (that...wasn\u2019t fun hahah like...really not fun...the black flies like WTF Pennsylvania!!!! Yikes!!) and then through to New England making sure to catch a border of every New England state except I think Vermont haha. (I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve actually been there yet...or maybe I have I honestly can\u2019t remember which states we made it through haha.) Ended our trip in Maine at the Atlantic Ocean. Whole idea was that we had spent so much of our relationship in the west coast on the pacific, we wanted to go all the other way to Atlantic, coast to coast together. :) \n\nHonestly, I would say I\u2019ve definitely seen more of the country than the average American. Thing is, if that\u2019s something you wanna do here and you don\u2019t have a reason like business or something to travel around everywhere, the country is just so big you actually have to put in effort if you want to see most of it. Even still, I haven\u2019t actually stopped and properly visited all the states. I\u2019d say at least 50% of them (save for AK and HI) I\u2019ve just driven through. So maybe you don\u2019t count that haha.\n\nEDIT: Another amazing location I\u2019ve been to: Muir Woods/the redwood forest in northern CA. Goddamn amazing. Definitely recommend but bring your hiking boots!",

        "SPC AC 281246 \n\nDay 1 Convective Outlook NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK 0746 AM CDT Wed Apr 28 2021\n\n Valid 281300Z - 291200Z\n\n ...THERE IS AN ENHANCED RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OVER PARTS OF SOUTHWEST TO NORTH-CENTRAL TEXAS...\n\n ...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS SURROUNDING THE ENHANCED RISK...AND ALSO OVER PARTS OF THE LOWER GREAT LAKES REGION...\n\n ...SUMMARY... Severe thunderstorms are possible across parts of the southern Plains to southwest Texas this afternoon and evening. Other severe storms may develop in parts of the lower Great Lakes region. In both areas, the most intense thunderstorms may produce large hail and wind damage. A tornado threat also may develop in the southern Plains and southwest Texas.\n\n ...Synopsis... A synoptic-scale split-flow pattern will dominate mid/upper levels over most of the CONUS, with a through-cutting northern stream from the Canadian Rockies across the northern Plains, Great Lakes and Northeast. A strong, positively tilted trough is evident from the central High Plains through a cyclone over AZ and across central Baja. The cyclone should shift eastward to eastern NM and far west TX through the period, with the trough extending from KS across northwestern MX. Downstream, a shortwave trough -- apparent in moisture-channel imagery over the upper Mississippi Valley region -- will cross the upper Great Lakes region through midday, penetrating the mean ridge, then crossing the lower Great Lakes and northern/inland Mid-Atlantic midday through afternoon, with some deamplification. \n\nAt the surface, 11Z analysis showed weak lows near BGM, MKG and RFD, along a wavy/quasistationary frontal zone. A cold front extended from the northern IL low across northern MO, south-central KS, the TX Panhandle, and central NM. A dryline extended from the front over the Panhandle southward across the Permian Basin to eastern Big Bend region. That segment of the front from MO across the southern Plains is forecast to make a net southeastward shift through the period, while moving more slowly/erratically east of the Mississippi River. By 00Z, the front should be located across western NY, the Lake Erie area, northern portions of IN/IL, western MO, southwestern OK, and the Permian Basin region. From north-south, the front will slowly overtake both the dryline and a prefrontal convective boundary discussed below.\n\n ...Southern Plains to Southwest TX... A broken and episodic belt of thunderstorms is expected through much of the period from the Ozarks region across OK to southwest TX. See tornado watch 116 and latest mesoscale discussion (446 at outlook time) for near-term guidance.\n\n The greatest overall severe threat and most-favorable parameter space should develop this afternoon and evening from north TX to the Rio Grande Valley near DRT. In that corridor, a few tornadoes are possible, along with large hail and damaging winds. Some of the hail be significant (2 inches or larger diameter), especially in the Rio Grande to southern Hill Country area, where very deep, well- organized supercells are possible with hailstones to near 4 inches in diameter.\n\n An outflow/convergence boundary, much of which still had reinforcing convection to its west, was analyzed from northwestern AR across east-central/south-central OK and north-central TX (west of the Metroplex), north of SJT and near OZA and 6R6. Some westward/ northwestward retreat of the activity/outflow boundary is probable today, especially during mesoscale spatiotemporal lulls in convection to its west. Increasing large-scale ascent and mass response to the approaching mid/upper cyclone indicate an enhanced severe threat today across this region -- both near the boundary and with more unconditional potential for late-afternoon/evening supercell development moving out of the Serranias del Burro region and across the Rio Grande. \n\nLow-level lift and vorticity should be maximized near the boundary, locally enlarging hodographs within an already favorable broader- scale CAPE/shear regime for supercells. Diurnal heating along and east of the boundary, rich low-level moisture (surface dew points commonly upper 60s to low 70s F and 1.5- to 2-inch PW), and steep midlevel lapse rates, will support MLCAPE from 1500-2500 J/kg over north TX to 22000-3000 J/kg over the Hill Country and Rio Grande -- all amidst 50-60-kt effective-shear magnitudes. Though with weaker moisture and deep shear, steep midlevel lapse rates and at least marginal CAPE will support severe hail and perhaps gusts or a tornado possible this afternoon and evening with convection developing on either side of the cold front (west of the warm-sector boundary activity) over OK and northwest TX. \n\n...Lower Great Lakes region... Widely scattered to scattered thunderstorms should develop this afternoon and this evening along and south of the front, offering sporadic large hail and damaging gusts. The deep-layer environment should destabilize and become buoyant fairly rapidly during midday and into the afternoon as these processes occur essentially simultaneously:\n\n1. Moisture/theta-e advection from the southwest and west-southwest, contributing to surface dew points increasing into the 50s to locally near 60 F;\n \n2. Increasing large-scale ascent and lapse rates aloft ahead of the approaching Great Lakes mid/upper perturbation; \n\n3. Diurnal heating and related steepening of boundary-layer lapse rates. Some mixing associated with this process may offset moist advection enough to slow the dew-point increase; still, MLCINH still should be reduced to near zero in much of the area such that only weak lift from the front, lake boundaries or orographic forcing will be needed to initiate convection. \n\nAccordingly modified model soundings indicate a deeply buoyant layer with 500-1200 J/kg peak/preconvective MLCAPE. A dominant westerly surface component will limit low-level shear and keep hodographs small, though mid/upper-level winds will be strong enough to support effective-shear magnitudes commonly in the 35-45-kt range. This will support mixed modes, with multicells, a few supercells and small bows possible. The threat should wane during mid/late evening as nocturnal cooling/low-level stabilization offset advective processes in reducing buoyancy. \n\n...Mid Mississippi Valley/lower Ohio Valley... Scattered thunderstorms are expected to develop predominantly south of the front through the evening hours, offering at least a marginal damaging-gust and large-hail threat. A tornado cannot be ruled out as well, with storm- to mesobeta-scale processes being the main determinant. This activity will be supported by a broad plume of low-level warm and moist advection, and diurnally weakened MLCINH in preconvective areas, away from the northeastern rim of the southern Plains EML. Surface dewpoints in the 60s F already are common across this corridor and should remain so, supporting areas of 1000-1500 J/kg MLCAPE -- locally/briefly higher this afternoon. 40-50-kt effective-shear magnitudes should become common as the buoyant layer deepens into stronger flow aloft.\n\n Parts of this region my realize a greater severe threat than the \"marginal\" probabilities currently depicted, conditional on sufficient organization and upscale/cold-pool growth of any thunderstorm clusters that can develop. If so, unconditional wind probabilities in particular may need a boost in a succeeding update, as mesoscale convective/environmental trends warrant.",

        "Trash on the beaches is almost as complicated as homelessness. I work for the Water Board, so here's a brief overview of what's going on. \\[Edit: yes, this is brief compared to what I \\*could\\* say\\]\n\nThe State Water Board issued [statewide trash provisions in 2015](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/trash_control/documentation.html), which will be incorporated into the (Los Angeles and Ventura counties regionwide Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) permit. This is the system that gathers stormwater runoff and discharges it untreated into streams and rivers, and in our case, beaches.  I think the permit should be finalized this year, and the stricter requirements for discharge of trash will apply to all the MS4 permittees, including all the cities in the two counties. Things move very slowly in the government, and the final  deadline for dischargers to comply with the new permit terms is in 2030. That may seem like a long time, but that's a compromise, and we usually have permittees asking for extensions because they haven't yet been able to implement all the programs or physical alterations to comply. Those changes may include public outreach, citywide bans on straws or styrofoam, increased street sweeping, or full trash capture devices. Here is the [timeline](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/stormwater/trash_implementation.html).\n\nNothing is enforceable until it is in a permit, and the provisions are usually only included in permits when a water body is impaired by a pollutant, or there are state or federal guidelines in place already that must be enforced on a local level. It all starts with gathering data. The regional water boards work with the state to assess water quality on a rolling basis. It takes about 4 years, and this year the LA region is starting. Once there is an impairment, we develop a TMDL, which assigns allowances of certain amounts of pollutants in discharge to different types of dischargers (eg MS4, agriculture, waterwater treatment plants) based on water quality targets. The TMDL also contains a timeline and requirements for dischargers to submit plans detailing how they will comply with the terms. In the case of trash, the major source is the MS4 program. You can skim through the [Lower San Gabriel River management plan](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/losangeles/water_issues/programs/stormwater/municipal/watershed_management/san_gabriel/lower_sangabriel/LSGRWMP2017update.pdf) for mentions of trash if you feel like some reading, to see what is currently being done.\n\nRight now, we do not have numeric data showing a trash impairment in the main stem of the San Gabriel River, the beaches in Belmont Shore and Long Beach, or the bay offshore. That sounds weird, because anyone who has walked along the beach in Belmont Shore after a rain has seen things just like your photos, or worse. The river is 58 miles long, mostly urban, and a tremendous amount of water comes through the stormwater system during a rain, along with whatever it carried away as it ran into the drains. Trash is different than most other water pollutants, which are analyzed at a lab from water samples collected in the field. Someone has to physically count pieces of trash and report them to us if we want to numerically assess trash. We can also use non-numeric methods like photos, for a different kind of assessment. I will see what I can do about that because I'm the person doing the assessing. And yes, it is an enormous job for one person. My predecessor got both carpal tunnel syndrome in his mouse hand, and a stomach ulcer.\n\nSomething else we are doing this year that we have not done before is to use the data the MS4 permittees submit in fulfillment of their permit requirements. This is also a huge job, and it wasn't done before because it's not in the right format and must be converted. But the MS4 permittees are required to monitor for trash, so it will be a very good source of new data.\n\nAll that being said, I don't think people should be so quick to blame \"lazy\" politicians or the government. We all generate trash. That mask that fell out of your pocket and you didn't notice until you got home? That paper coffee cup you placed on top of an overflowing trash can? The cigarette you flicked into the street? These can all end up in the ocean. I do beach cleanups and I know the empty cases of beer and discarded Styrofoam containers of take-out food didn't wash down through the river.\n\nSo what else can you do other than avoid generating trash, and keeping pollutants out of storm drains? You can do beach cleanups or pick up trash around your home or on hikes. You can do this by yourself, with friends, or join a local non-profit. There are usually monthly beach clean ups. You can even adopt a beach. You can get involved in politics by attending city council meetings, contacting the mayor or council members your city, or state assembly members. There is a citizens group I work with that has been very successful in getting the attention of politicians, such that we have had meetings with them, their mayor, their city manager, and their local assembly person. You can provide public comment on upcoming Water Board actions, or attend workshops. The public comment period has expired, but keep watching the [Regional MS4 permit page](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/losangeles/water_issues/programs/stormwater/municipal/#1) to see if anything pops up. Our email lists are divided by subject and you can [sign up](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/resources/email_subscriptions/reg4_subscribe.html) to be notified when there is an action on a subject of interest. You can also attend Board meetings, which are held virtually right now due to covid-19, and speak during the open public comment period. If you do that, there's a good chance a board member will turn to us and ask us to look into it.",

Grabbed some other various nodes and trimmed some not-worth-it DPS for more health and for WHISPERS OF DOOM, which gives us room for defensive curses.\n\nReplaced the CWDT in the wand for a TRIGGER, which will be a while to unveil, but will be worth it and will mean more reliable spellcasting.

        "It really depends on your blog. Some blogs are more creative than others but lets say your blog is about fishing (in the below example change \"fishing\" to your website topic/niche). To get people to visit your blog you need to know what they are interested in within the niche of fishing. So the first thing i would do is:\n\n1.**Google search** \"fishing\". At the bottom of the first result page Google displays \"Searches Related to\". Choose a few of those topics to write about as long as they are relevant to your website.\n\n*Example keywords that showed up: fishing rods, fishing gear*\n\n2. **Google Search + space**. Another way to find relevant topics related to your niche is typing your keyword in Google and then hit the space button after it. Google will show you even more relevant searches to your keyword that did not show up in the \"Searches related to\" section.\n\n*Example keywords that showed up: fishing net, fishing pole, fishing license, fishing spots*\n\n3. **Google search +space + alphabet**. This method is similar to the above method but after you hit the space button try typing one random letter . For example:\n\n*Fishing + space button + L  results get: fishing lines, fishing lakes, fishing line knots*\n\n*Fishing + space button + B  results get: fishing bait, fishing backpack, fishing basket*\n\n*Fishing + space button + E  results get: fishing equipment, fishing essentials, fishing expo*\n\nTurn these keywords into attractive topics like \" *Fishing Expos You Wont Want to Miss in 2021*\", \"*Here is a list of Fishing Essentials that every Fisherman needs!*\", or \" *Look at What I Caught Fishing in Lake Erie!*\". Of course these have to be true to your own experience, don't make stuff up.\n\n4. **Answer The Public** \\- Type your keyword into [Answer The Public](https://answerthepublic.com/). The result will show you questions people commonly have about your niche/topic. Be sure to answer them.\n\n5. **Semrush or Ubersuggest**. I also type my keyword into [Semrush](https://www.semrush.com/) or [Ubbersuggest](https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/). You can search 4 - 5 keywords on these platform per day before they require you to pay for a plan. If you can afford it I would eventually pay for the plan at least for a month, do your research and cancel it.\n\n6. **Socratic Method** (My Favorite Method) - As a bonus the \"Socratic method\" is also a college word referencing to philosopher Socrates  who constantly asked questions, but I don't want to bore you with school. This method is basically keep asking questions like \"why and how\" while simultaneously answering your questions, just so you can come up with even more questions. You will definitely come up with a question people had in mind but may not have searched. For example:\n\n*Why do people fish? (because it's relaxing),*\n\n*Why is fishing relaxing? (because no one else is around, its just them and nature)*\n\n*Do people like being alone? (sometimes, yes) Why?*\n\n*Is fishing popular? (yes)  Why is fishing popular ( i dont know???)*\n\n*Do people eat the fish they catch? Is fishing morally wrong? is it possible to fish with just your hands? Why or why not? Who was the first fisherman? Why did he originally fish? Any controversies around fishing? Can I shoot a fish? Can I use a harpoon? Is it illegal? What type of punishment am i looking at? Whats the biggest, largest, ugliest fish? How do fish mate? etc.*\n\nThe questions are sometimes endless. This method gets your critical thinking process going and helps you really dig deep into your niche. I did this with a personal finance page I own and if you don't know that niche is a brutal space to compete in. I currently rank on the 1st page with low DA competing with TD bank, Capitol One, Creditcards.com, The Balance, Nerdwallet and giant multimillion dollar companies using this method. You also want to over-deliver, give your audience more than what they might have expected.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo...I hope this has been helpful.",

And if I do, as you say, I'll definitely go with someone who's done it before.\n\nThere is a cut at lake erie ive fished that's nearly 30 feet deep. In the summer I've got bass, sheepshead, and pike. I've really been curious and maybe you would know, if I drop shot there this time of the year do you think anything would be there? Maybe walleye or something? Or would I be better off going for shallower waters as you said? I've tried to google this stuff but I figured asking people who may also know the area would be better.",

        "So, fun story. I went through the ice once while ice biking. Bike and all. It was suprisingly deep. I know because I touched bottom with my bike. About six feet. I did not fully submerse, just my shoulders and head stayed above water. I was suprised by how slowly I sank in. Probably due air trapped in my biking clothing. I was also suprised by how while it was cold it was not shockingly cold. I merely reached down with one arm on top of the ice and pulled the bike up and swung it onto the ice. I then used it as a balast and kicking with my legs with two hands on the bike for support was able to wriggle up onto solid ice back the way I came. After retracing my steps about 30 feet I got back on my bike and started biking to generate heat. In 30 minutes or so I was so warm and comfortable I decided to keep biking. Indeed I reentered the ice later and proceeded up stream and had another small breakthru which is not uncommon on these small streams but since I was further upstream it was very minor and only a couple feet deep. In essence... the fact that it was such a non-event scares the sh*t out of me now. Like it was some get out of jail free card.\n\nI guess the lasting impact is that I realized I was lucky as f*ck that there was no current even though it was a smaller stream. The very fact that it was a warmer day after a long deep freeze had caused ice in the main channel of an otherwise large marshy tidal area to melt from underneath as where it was invisible to the naked eye. Had the flow been even a little greater it could have swept me under the ice since it was so deep.\n\nI do not know what to attribute the lack of cold shock to besides being already warm to the point of sweating from biking and also due trapped air in my cloathing. Truth is I dress cold while biking because I generate so much heat. This is to say I don't wear much. That day I happen to be wearing a bulkier shell wind breaker jacket that was semi waterproof this delayed the water rushing in some.  I also was wearing merino base layers top to bottom and water proof boots delaying cold to the feet.  The most impressive thing to me is my finger never even got cold. Under normal circumstances while biking they are the first thing to get cold and the last thing to warm up. I was able to start generating heat so quickly they did not have time.\n\nPerhaps even the fact that I was already sweating and hot meant there was already moisture in the base layers that delayed or eased the saturation of cold water into those layers.\n\n\nP.S. Before I stared ice biking I used to travel these same small streams and creeks for miles as a kid. Mostly they are narrow and very shallow. Only a couple feet. It was because I was closer to where the stream enter the great lakes where it widens and turns marshy that it was deeper, but still having also paddled it since and seen it near empty due tide and wind I still was suprised it was so deep. It never has much flow but things due change rapidly under the ice during thaws.\n\nI have shared this experience in thehopes that others will offer incite and also share their experiences. Indeed, the other lasting impact is I want to learn more and gsin more experience, i.e. submersing in controlled environments with other people on hand and basic saftey gear so I can better learn what works/doesn't. Am very experienced cyclist, semi experienced open water kayaker though not w cold water kayaker and huge lover of winter camping and outdoor sports like xcskiing, snow shoeing, hiking, winter hammocking qnd just love love love camping in snow. Water, even now has always been my week spot, thiugh I am learning more and more about long distance paddling on the great lakes and open water self rescue thru experiencing self rescue in as many controlled but testing situations like choppy water and surf. You can never be to experienced. Dealing with a swamped kayak in rough open waters alone is my biggest fear. Quite frankly I do not understand how some people paddle the open ocean. Here on lake erie the wind can stir up waves unexpectedly in the space of an hour on an otherwise calm day. There is no way to forecast it.",

        "Just mash the \"stop loading\" button when loading the page and you can often stop the paywall script before it can load.  Which is how I got this:\n\n\nTom Henry\nThe Blade\nthenry@theblade.com\nJan 7, 2021\n12:10 PM\n\nLest there be any confusion, agricultural runoff is western Lake Erie\u2019s biggest source of algae-forming nutrients.\n\nA third Ohio Environmental Protection Agency study since 2016 has confirmed that through science, firming up past conclusions.  \n\nThe agency has been doing that through so-called \u201cnutrient mass balance\u201d studies which look at data that tracks algae-forming phosphorus across the state.\n\nIn 2015, the Ohio General Assembly passed a law requiring them to be done once every two years.\n\nThat decision came in response to Toledo\u2019s 2014 algae-driven water crisis, when the city\u2019s tap water was deemed unsafe to drink or touch over the first weekend of August that year because an algal poison from the lake had breached the city\u2019s treatment system.\n\nFor those studies, the Ohio EPA uses the best available data to determine the percentages of algae-growing phosphorus and nitrogen coming from non-point sources - primarily farm runoff - or point sources, typically sewage treatment plants and their system overflows.\n\nNorthwest Ohio\u2019s Maumee and Sandusky rivers were among 11 watersheds examined across the state.\n\nThe most recent report, issued on Christmas Eve, didn\u2019t deviate much from the 2018 study - not that anyone expected a large shift within such a relatively short amount of time.\n\nThe latest report shows 89 percent of the Maumee River\u2019s phosphorus comes from non-point sources such as agricultural runoff, compared to 88 percent in 2018.\n\nIt also shows non-point sources - again, primarily agriculture - account for 92 percent of the Sandusky River\u2019s phosphorus now, compared to 93 percent in 2018.\n\nPercentages vary from stream to stream, but - for much of the state - consistently show agriculture as a primary driver. One exception is the Cuyahoga River watershed near Cleveland, because it is much more urbanized than streams in northwest Ohio and elsewhere.\n\n\u201cSignificant changes generally are not expected over a short time period,\u201d Heidi Griesmer, Ohio EPA spokesman, said. \u201cHowever, in addition to being required by law every two years, the nutrient studies help us track trends over short periods. Over longer periods, the data compiled will identify whether significant changes are occurring. The next report is due in 2022 and will include nine years of data for comparison.\u201d\n\nTy Higgins, Ohio Farm Bureau Federation spokesman, said there \u201cis simply not enough data to show any definitive trends\u201d yet.\n\n\u201cBut he agreed the findings, along with other current water quality research, are \u201ckey components to finding science-based solutions for clean water and more data will certainly be helpful as future studies are released.\u201d\n\nPhosphorus is the nutrient most closely associated with algal bloom sizes, while nitrogen often influences toxicity.\n\nOne reason for the heavy input from agriculture: Seventy-nine percent of the Maumee River watershed\u2019s land is in agricultural production.\n\nIn the Sandusky River watershed, 80 percent of the land is in agricultural production.\n\nRunoff figures in spring and early summer \u2014 when most of the fertilizers are applied \u2014 often are dictated by not only volumes of rainfall between March 1 and July 31, but also the severity, timing, and duration of thunderstorms, experts have said.\n\nMs. Griesmer said the latest study \u201cconfirms information from previous [nutrient mass balance] work about phosphorus loading.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis information confirms that H2Ohio is on the right path in focusing on the agricultural sources of phosphorus running into the western basin of Lake Erie,\u201d she said.\n\nShelby Croft, Ohio Department of Agriculture spokesman, said that agency has been focused on water quality issues for years. It, too, has confidence in the DeWine administration\u2019s H2Ohio program, although she did not rule out the possibility of adjustments as more science comes in.\n\n\u201cODA has learned many things about delivering the H2Ohio program in the past 11 months, and undoubtedly what we\u2019ve learned will lead to tweaks in program structure and delivery methods in the future,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. Croft said the state agriculture department remains committed to programs based around voluntary incentives.\n\n\u201cMoving forward, additional research and monitoring data will likely cause adjustments to [best management practices] offered through the program, or may bring new practices into the program,\u201d she said.\n\nEnvironmentalists said they saw shortcomings in the latest report.\n\nPam Taylor of Environmentally Concerned Citizens of South Central Michigan said it\u2019s \u201cno surprise that the watersheds in northwest Ohio continue to be highest nonpoint sources of phosphorus.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe continue to test the water in Michigan\u2019s portion of both the Maumee and Raisin watersheds, as we\u2019ve done for 20 years, and have seen no improvement,\u201d she said. \u201cUntil the application of liquid manure over subsurface drain tiles is restricted in the western Lake Erie region, and until the states involved and the U.S. EPA demand accountability in the form of water tests instead of soil tests or evidence of best practices, nothing will change and the millions of dollars spent on remediation for harmful algae and bacterial pollution problems here will continue to be wasted.\u201d\n\nMike Ferner, Advocates for a Clean Lake Erie founder, described the report as \u201ctwo more years of [the Ohio EPA] kicking the can down the road, telling us what we already know: the lion\u2019s share of what\u2019s poisoning Lake Erie comes from agriculture.\u201d\n\nSandy Bihn, Lake Erie Waterkeeper founder, said this and previous reports \u201care remiss in reporting the massive increases\u201d in manure generated by livestock facilities close to or large enough to be known as concentrated animal feeding operations, or CAFOs.\n\n\u201cFailing to disclose major manure increases in the Maumee and failing to divide agriculture into commercial fertilizer and manure means that Ohio wants to tout the H2O rhetoric to make it look like Ohio cares about Lake Erie, but in reality Ohio is doing little to nothing to reduce manure sources,\u201d she said.\n\nFirst Published January 7, 2021, 8:42am",

        "Nah I don\u2019t mind talking about it, it\u2019s nothing that haunts me: it\u2019s just sort of my submechaniphobia origin story.\n\nWhen I was young (probably about 8 years old) my grandparents used to have a 5th wheel camping trailer that they would take to a campground near Lake Erie in Ontario. Throughout the summer break my grandparents would often baby sit my sister, a couple of my cousins and I and we\u2019d spend a few days at a time at the campgrounds. We all loved visiting our grandparents, riding our bikes through the park, swimming in the lake and just having a good time.\n\nThe campground had its own, nice, isolated section of beach where we\u2019d play and swim while we were there and about half a click down the shore was a small harbour for leisure craft like speed boats, small fishing boats, etc. At the beach itself, about 100-150 metres off the shore was a shallow sandbar and on that sandbar was a small fishing boat [(something like this)](https://www.google.com/search?q=small+fishing+boat&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjwhYqDhqnuAhXBOM0KHcd2B6cQ2-cCegQIABAC&amp;oq=small+fishing&amp;gs_lcp=ChJtb2JpbGUtZ3dzLXdpei1pbWcQARgAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAA6BAgjECc6BAgAEEM6BwgjEOoCECc6BQgAELEDUPYZWIpCYONHaAFwAHgBgAGTAYgB5hiSAQQwLjI2mAEAoAEBsAEFwAEB&amp;sclient=mobile-gws-wiz-img&amp;ei=XV0HYLDjGMHxtAbH7Z24Cg&amp;bih=622&amp;biw=414&amp;prmd=isvn&amp;rlz=1CDGOYI_enCA822CA822&amp;hl=en-US#imgrc=zW-d5K5Y73QQpM).\n\nThis boat was beached... sort of. You see, the sandbar wasn\u2019t marked and it was a danger to some of the watercraft with deeper keels. This fishing boat had been there for as long as I could remember and visually by looking at it from a distance, it was certainly there for a long time. The boat was aged and obviously abandoned but for whatever reason it was never removed from the sand bar. My cousins and I were not allowed to go near the boat of course, my grandma told us that if we went near it, it could suck us in and drown us (which of course scared the hell out of me.) This boat, in my mind sort of became a mystical, ominous figure off in the distance away from the shore that wanted to hurt me, like some sort of scary monster.\n\nOne day while my cousins, sister and I were swimming, we all starting joking around about going out to the boat. We were all fantastic swimmers and my cousins and sister were older than me so I guess I felt like I had something to prove. I didn\u2019t want them to think I was a chicken! So we all swam our way out to where we couldn\u2019t touch the bottom, on our way to the boat, my grandma hadn\u2019t noticed we were making our way out there so we kept going. As we swam, the boat was getting closer and closer. We eventually came up to the sand bar. The sand bar was about 4 feet under the water so we could sort of walk at this point. But as we could touch again, there it was: the boat was close now. This shadowy monster was right there in front of me about 25 feet away. I was scared shitless and at this point, I think my cousins and sister were too. It looked harmless at a distance but up close, it was much bigger, the metal parts were covered in rust, seaweed covered the hull and you could hear the water sloshing up against it. The sight of it up close struck fear in to me: it was large and intimidating, it was disgusting, imposing and ominous. To me, it was evil.\n\nWe eventually made our way back to shore afterward and although we didn\u2019t climb on the boat or even touch it (we were all too scared) it sort of left a scar in my brain. I remember a reoccurring nightmare I had as a child about falling in to a lake at night and getting dragged in by this boat and sucked underneath it.\n\nAnyways, sorry if that was a long read. I\u2019m 24 years old now and I don\u2019t have many fears: heights, snakes, spiders, public speaking, none of it bothers me but I\u2019m still a little creeped out by submerged man made objects.\n\nFrom what I understand most \u201cirrational\u201d fears (meaning ones that aren\u2019t really logical) often stem from childhood experiences. When your brain is young and still developing, these things sort of leave an impression on you more so than they might with a more logically thinking adult. These experiences train your brain quickly and trigger your long term memory more easily so the things that scare the hell out of you as a child can stay with you for a long time.",

They are better than minnows. They are better than your favorite  artificial or fly. They are better for all species, at all times of  year, and in all places.\n\nI\u2019ll say it again, to fan the flames \u2014 raw hot dogs are the best freshwater bait.\n\nI  can hear the collective roar right now. The howling mob cries, \u201cBut raw  hot dogs aren\u2019t natural! They aren\u2019t on the natural freshwater fish  menu.\u201d Another contingent clings furiously to their tin of Canadian  crawlers or striped spoon and aches to tell the saga of how their  personal favorite has never \u2014 personally \u2014 failed them.\n\nI  don\u2019t care. The howling mob is wrong. Raw hot dogs are the culmination  of the search for the perfect freshwater bait. This is eternal. This is  crystal-correct.\n\nIt  seems somehow filthy to mouth the words, even to me. I grew up with hot  dogs as a bait of last resort \u2014 something to bulk out a trot line or  with which to bait a child\u2019s line so they didn\u2019t \u201cwaste\u201d all the good  bait.\n\nAnd  yet, the proof is in the liver pudding. Hot dogs have all the best  characteristics of your personal favorites. They leave a scent trail  without peer like chicken liver without the accompanying bloody mess.  They doggedly stick to even wire hooks in swift currents and bubbly  streams. They encourage engulfing bites, allowing your circle hooks to  work their magic. They are cheap. You can store them in the fridge  without unduly upsetting your housemates. They require little-to-no  special care on the bank or the boat to keep them in fishing shape.\n\nAnd they catch fish.\n\nOh, do they ever catch fish.\n\nI  was first turned on to the hot dog gospel at the pond at Virginia\u2019s  Beach in Erie, Pennsylvania \u2014 not to be confused with the other, saltier  Virginia Beach.\n\nVirginia\u2019s  Beach boasts a muddy little pond that serves as a reservoir for the  run-off from the cleaning table. Real Fisherman bring in their walleye  and perch, strip the offal out, and then let the assorted effluvia run  into the pond to bulk up the humble catfish, bass, and sunfish that have  been tossed into the pond over the years.\n\nOn  skunked-day four, I began to believe that the fish in the pond were  invincible. They were surely in there \u2014 I saw some absolute hogshead  catfish nibbling at the muddy banks in the morning. But they turned  their collective noses up at absolutely every offering I had.  Nightcrawlers, live minnows, dead minnows, mashed minnows, artificial  goos of all kinds, marshmallows, spoons, roostertails, spinners and more  \u2014 not even a nibble.\n\nI  was packing it in one morning to head to the lake proper when I told  one of the caretakers about the decidedly snobby fish in his pond.\n\n\u201cGot a hot dog?\u201d he said.\n\nI did. It\u2019s a camp. Hot dogs are the solid foundation of the camping pyramid.\n\nAnd  it worked. Instantly, I have to add. On my first cast, I connected with  one of those lunker catfish that had been teasing me every morning for  the past week. And again. And again.\n\nThe  hot dog trick worked on the pond\u2019s resident largemouth, sparking  Jaws-style strikes from below when dragged across the surface of the  water. Teensy slivers of \u2018dog accounted for sunfish after sunfish, till I  reached the holy grail of sunfish angling \u2014 my fingers ached from  twisting the hooks out of their tiny mouths.\n\nI became a convert that day, on the shores of a tiny pond by the shores of Lake Erie.\n\nBut  wait, the mob says \u2014 sure, hot dogs work fine in little farm ponds  because they\u2019re a novelty. They can\u2019t compete in wide-open lakes and  streams with natural forage.\n\nYes. Yes, they can.\n\nLater that week, raw hot dogs accounted for walleye in the lake proper, a fat Northern, and plenty of dog-gobbling drum.\n\nWhen  I returned to my home waters of the Allegheny River outside Pittsburgh,  the hot dog magic continued. Suckers and smallmouth, channels and  flatheads, bluegill and baitfish all march to the beat of the hot dog  drum.\n\nWhat  about trout? Surely, the fish that can tell whether you wound your fly  with two bands of pheasant or three in imitation of some obscure water  insect wouldn\u2019t stoop to gobbling a gas station hot dog.\n\nTrout  are as guilty as the rest in their love of the dog. Cut into  quarter-inch cubes and fished like an egg rig, they are lethal.\n\nThis  is a lot to take in, I know. Years of learning at pap\u2019s knee, of  reading countless fishing articles and magazines, and maybe even  personal experience have just been laid low. The temptation might be to  forget you ever read about using hot dogs as bait and continue on in low  ignore, accepting that some days the fish just aren\u2019t biting.\n\nIt\u2019s not your bait. It\u2019s not your fault. It\u2019s the weather. The barometer. The conditions. The wind.\n\nIt\u2019s called fishing, not catching.\n\nToss away your crutch. Toss away your pricey goops and live baits and hatch-matching equipment.\n\nEmbrace the lowly hot dog.\n\nWithin a cast or two, you\u2019ll also be a convert.",

They doggedly stick to even wire hooks in swift currents and bubbly   streams. They encourage engulfing bites, allowing your circle hooks to   work their magic. They are cheap. You can store them in the fridge   without unduly upsetting your housemates. They require little-to-no   special care on the bank or the boat to keep them in fishing shape.\n\nAnd they catch fish.\n\nOh, do they ever catch fish.\n\nI   was first turned on to the hot dog gospel at the pond at Virginia\u2019s   Beach in Erie, Pennsylvania \u2014 not to be confused with the other, saltier   Virginia Beach.\n\nVirginia\u2019s   Beach boasts a muddy little pond that serves as a reservoir for the   run-off from the cleaning table. Real Fisherman bring in their walleye   and perch, strip the offal out, and then let the assorted effluvia run   into the pond to bulk up the humble catfish, bass, and sunfish that have   been tossed into the pond over the years.\n\nOn   skunked-day four, I began to believe that the fish in the pond were   invincible. They were surely in there \u2014 I saw some absolute hogshead   catfish nibbling at the muddy banks in the morning. But they turned   their collective noses up at absolutely every offering I had.   Nightcrawlers, live minnows, dead minnows, mashed minnows, artificial   goos of all kinds, marshmallows, spoons, roostertails, spinners and more   \u2014 not even a nibble.\n\nI  was  packing it in one morning to head to the lake proper when I told  one of  the caretakers about the decidedly snobby fish in his pond.\n\n\u201cGot a hot dog?\u201d he said.\n\nI did. It\u2019s a camp. Hot dogs are the solid foundation of the camping pyramid.\n\nAnd   it worked. Instantly, I have to add. On my first cast, I connected  with  one of those lunker catfish that had been teasing me every morning  for  the past week. And again. And again.\n\nThe   hot dog trick worked on the pond\u2019s resident largemouth, sparking   Jaws-style strikes from below when dragged across the surface of the   water. Teensy slivers of \u2018dog accounted for sunfish after sunfish, till I   reached the holy grail of sunfish angling \u2014 my fingers ached from   twisting the hooks out of their tiny mouths.\n\nI became a convert that day, on the shores of a tiny pond by the shores of Lake Erie.\n\nBut   wait, the mob says \u2014 sure, hot dogs work fine in little farm ponds   because they\u2019re a novelty. They can\u2019t compete in wide-open lakes and   streams with natural forage.\n\nYes. Yes, they can.\n\nLater that week, raw hot dogs accounted for walleye in the lake proper, a fat Northern, and plenty of dog-gobbling drum.\n\nWhen   I returned to my home waters of the Allegheny River outside  Pittsburgh,  the hot dog magic continued. Suckers and smallmouth,  channels and  flatheads, bluegill and baitfish all march to the beat of  the hot dog  drum.\n\nWhat  about  trout? Surely, the fish that can tell whether you wound your fly  with  two bands of pheasant or three in imitation of some obscure water   insect wouldn\u2019t stoop to gobbling a gas station hot dog.\n\nTrout   are as guilty as the rest in their love of the dog. Cut into   quarter-inch cubes and fished like an egg rig, they are lethal.\n\nThis   is a lot to take in, I know. Years of learning at pap\u2019s knee, of   reading countless fishing articles and magazines, and maybe even   personal experience have just been laid low. The temptation might be to   forget you ever read about using hot dogs as bait and continue on in  low  ignore, accepting that some days the fish just aren\u2019t biting.\n\nIt\u2019s not your bait. It\u2019s not your fault. It\u2019s the weather. The barometer. The conditions. The wind.\n\nIt\u2019s called fishing, not catching.\n\nToss away your crutch. Toss away your pricey goops and live baits and hatch-matching equipment.\n\nEmbrace the lowly hot dog.\n\nWithin a cast or two, you\u2019ll also be a convert.",

        "IHSA/IEA/NCEA/any program like that can be SO hit or miss depending on the factors at play. Your flair says eventing, so I\u2019m going to assume you\u2019re looking at the hunt seat side of things rather than western. Most of my experience (at least with IHSA) is in the hunt seat stuff. I haven\u2019t done anything with that college or in that zone, but I have worked with others and have random general knowledge \ud83d\ude05\n\n\nI\u2019m in an area with a rather small amount of IHSA teams. We have two major colleges with teams, one located centrally and one located about two hours south. I believe other colleges in the state do have riding teams, but they aren\u2019t as competitive. Many of the colleges with big riding programs are equipped very well and have their own equestrian centers and barns that they use for both show hosting and practicing. Lake Erie and SCAD are two off the top of my head that have their own facilities just for the college riders and horses. The college teams in my area are \u201chooked into\u201d the college, but they ride out of a local AA hunter/jumper barn with the head trainer of that barn, who is also the team\u2019s coach. They do occasionally host shows out of that barn, however it doesn\u2019t really have the area needed so they usually show at a local equestrian center. \n\n\nA lot of what you\u2019ll get depends on the area you are in too. The \u201chorsey\u201d areas of the country (ex. Kentucky, Texas, the entirety of the east coast, some of the west coast, etc) are often where you\u2019ll find bigger programs with better facilities. The teams with the big equestrian centers are usually the ones who host shows, especially the regional and zone finals. So an advantage to going to a school in one of those areas is that it will majorly cut down on travel time and cost to shows, rather than if you go to a school in a state that doesn\u2019t have as big of a program or shows mostly out of state.\n\n\nHorse quality is also going to range, and as I\u2019m sure you already know, there\u2019s going to be a little bit of everything. I know of quite a few people who allow teams to use their personally owned horses for shows and practices every so often. It gets them a cut on board and their horse gets ridden when they can\u2019t ride it. A lot of students often do this too if they bring their horse along with them and it\u2019s suitable for the program. So most of those horses are fairly nice, especially if they were/are show horses. Another way that colleges get horses is through horse donations. Again, these are often retired show horses who still have miles left on them. The rest of the horses are most likely going to be whatever is in the trainer\u2019s barn, especially if the school doesn\u2019t own the horses. This could lead to drawing pokey school horses often ridden only by children that need to be pushed to a jump, ex western pleasure horses in the flat, a 25 year old been there done that type who still enjoys working, or even a hotter jumper being used as a eq horse. We (at least when I was more involved with it) would also try to pair horses to the class they best fit in whenever possible, especially when they would be ridden by someone with not as much riding experience. So the older lesson horse types/lower level rides would stick to flat classes and novices, maybe the occasional intermediate. Open would mostly be left to the horses that were more skilled or sometimes a bit more of a challenging ride to the fences, as that\u2019s the division where the most experienced riders would be. That\u2019s just the way we tried to do things, not saying it\u2019s going to be like that everywhere but 99% of the time they use common sense.\n\n\nCoaches are usually very picky at what they select as their team horses. I have seen green, I have seen hot, I have seen old and lazy and grumpy. But I can never recall seeing flat out dangerous. I\u2019ve seen horses that act up too much get pulled from the competition and the rider is given a reride. So I wouldn\u2019t be too worried about the prospect of getting something you absolutely can\u2019t ride. You\u2019ll get evaluated during the team tryouts and placement test and they are careful with what divisions they put riders in, especially with people who aren\u2019t as familiar with the format of these shows. And of course you\u2019ll ride all types of horses in practice to prepare for shows.\n\n\nSorry for the novel \ud83d\ude02 but I hope you can take something away from that! IHSA is super fun with the right program and can really broaden your skills and give you confidence. My best advice is don\u2019t be afraid to ask questions and talk to the other riders on the team. Feel things out, when you tour the college try and visit the barn too and just get the general idea on their horse upkeep, vibe, etc. And listen to your gut for sure. There\u2019s certainly something out there for you! If you\u2019d like to know anything else feel free to ask and I\u2019ll see if I can help :) best of luck!",

        "I don't know how common it is to know the history of the United States in other countries, but that could help if you do.  Oklahoma has a fairly pronounced shape with the extended panhandle.  The panhandle part was once part of Texas.  So if you can remember where Texas is, then Oklahoma would be right above it.\n\nMissouri was where the settlers started off when heading west to California along the Oregon trail.  It's right on the Mississippi river, which is straight up from Louisiana, smack in the middle really.  If you know where Louisiana is then that leaves Arkansas right in the middle between Missouri and Lousiana.  You could also remember the first letters M-A-L, marked a location -Missouri Arkansas Louisiana.\n\nThe Ohio River is very important river.  One of the largest volume rivers in the country.  It starts from Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania and flows along the bottom of the state of Ohio, then along Indiana, Illinois and into the Mississippi.  Michigan and Ohio are friendly rivals due to a lot of history they had.  Their sports teams are often very competitive against each other.  So if you can find Michigan, Ohio is below it.  Ohio is also south of Lake Erie, so if you can remember Ohio as an Eerie (scary) place that may help.Illinois of course is Chicago, most people don't know much about it otherwise, most of it is just farmland really.  However the greater Chicago metropolitan area also stretches along the bottom of lake Michigan and into Indiana its neighbor.  So if you can find Lake Michigan, you can find Chicago and you can remember Illinois and Indiana re next to each other at the bottom.\n\nNew Hampshire is one a lot of people get confused with Vermont.  If you look closely you'll see Vermont is sort of V shaped to match its first letter.  So New Hampshire is the one next to it.  Historically Vermont was an independent country for about 14 years after the American Revolution due to its territory being claimed by both New Hampshire and New York.  So they are obviously next to each other.  Look for the V shape state if you know what New York looks like, then it must be the other one and that is New Hampshire.\n\nRhode Island is the smallest state with the longest name.  Since you already know Rhode Island is on the east coast, just look for the smallest state.  If that doesn't help, you could also think it's right by Boston, Massachusetts.  Boston famously speaks a dialect of English which is non rhotic, meaning they like to drop the letter \"r\".  My caw is at the baw.  So think of non rhotic Boston and the letter r is missing because it is in neighboring Rhode Island.\n\nDelaware is actually the second smallest state in the union.  If you remember the smallest states are in the east, and the largest in the west that will help.  There is the famous painting of Washington crossing the Delaware River an event from the American revolutionary war.  If you remember that painting, then you remember Delaware is near Washington.  Look for the little state on the peninsula across from Washington DC.\n\nWisconsin sits on the western edge of Lake Michigan.  Their sports teams are rivals with those from Chicago oftentimes.  If you can find Chicago go north and there's Wisconsin.  Also it starts with a \"w\", remember w for west of Lake Michigan.\n\nIf all you're left with is Nebraska, Kansas, and Iowa, remember N is for north, Nebraska is north of Kansas and you can sort those two out. Nebraska has a little notch taken out of it, you could remember n is for notch also.  Iowa, gosh that's a hard one, there isn't much to say about it.  I guess if you're familiar with the word iota, it has a meaning of something tiny.  So Iowa is similar to the word iota.  Iowa is the smallest of the three of Nebraska, Kansas, iowa.  There isn't much to say about Iowa other than it has a lot of corn.  I guess if that's the only one left it's Iowa.\n\nIt's interesting you didn't say Arizona and New Mexico.  Those are two which confuse a lot of folks.  We read from left to right, and A comes first so Arizona is on the left.\n\nAnyway, I enjoy coming up with memory tricks as a sort of game to see how much I can recall.  A lot of it is finding an association to help with recall.  If you can make multiple links to something and you can't remember the thing, you can try to remember the links which will lead you to the thing.  So for the states you have trouble with, read up on them a little and see if anything weird or interesting jumps out at you which may help you remember it.\n\nI'd also recommend playing quizzes on [Sporcle.com](https://Sporcle.com).  They have a lot of great ones on there which makes learning just about anything easier.  \n\n\nI hope this helps.",

        "You joke but\n\nToledo was hub of interurban 100 years ago\nDAVID PATCH\nThe Blade\ndpatch@theblade.com\n MAY 27, 2007 5:05 AM\nAs the 19th century drew to a close, travel between cities or from farm to market was a tedious affair.\n\nUsually it involved a bumpy wagon ride on rutted roads, which could be made impassable by mud or snow.\n\nWhile electric streetcars served city dwellers and steam railroads crisscrossed the nation, passenger service to many smaller communities was relatively infrequent, expensive, and often not tailored for short-distance day trips.\n\nBut the perfection of systems that could distribute electricity over long distances was changing that. Power companies looked at the trolley networks that provided cheap mass transportation in many major cities and took what looked like the next logical step: Why not run electric-powered railways out into the country, or even link cities? Doing so would provide for transportation needs and create new markets for electricity service.\n\nThus the interurban railway was born, and nowhere was it more prevalent than in Ohio. Accounts differ as to which was first, but one of the earliest lines was a route that opened in 1893 between Sandusky and Norwalk. As the century turned, interurban railways sprang up all over the Midwest. By 1908, the 2,800 miles of interurban routes in Ohio were 1,000 miles more than in any other state.\n\nFlat terrain and relatively dense population, with small agricultural communities scattered throughout, had made Ohio and its neighboring states ideal places to build interurban railways. And for a short time, interurban railways were the fifth-largest industry in the United States.\n\nToledo, which quickly developed into a major hub, was served by 11 interurban companies. Frequent service was available to Monroe, Blissfield, Metamora, Wauseon, Waterville, Bowling Green, Fostoria, Oak Harbor, Genoa, and other nearby towns.\n\nHourly or every-two-hours service was available to more distant cities like Cleveland, Detroit, Dayton, Cincinnati, and Fort Wayne. Even Put-in-Bay had a line - a mere 1.5 miles long, with eight trolley cars.\n\nLocal service was the interurbans' forte; the Toledo &amp; Indiana route, as an example, had 31 stations on its 57-mile route between Toledo and Bryan.\n\nFor many years, the Cincinnati &amp; Lake Erie's 217-mile Toledo-Cincinnati run was the longest direct trolley in the United States. But by changing from one line to another, it was possible to travel even greater distances. One could travel by interurban all the way from the upstate New York city of Oneonta to Elkhart Lake, Wis., north of Milwaukee.\n\nThe interurbans' big electric rail cars dwarfed the city trolleys whose tracks they shared while running in and out of the downtowns. Out on open track in the countryside, they routinely galloped along at up to 80 mph. Electric propulsion permitted rapid acceleration and inexpensive operation, so the interurbans could make frequent stops and offer lower fares than had been possible on traditional railroads.\n\nInterurbans were a hit with traveling salesmen, who suddenly had a convenient way to hop from town to town. They allowed scholastic sports teams to travel farther for competition. Farmers could ship produce conveniently to nearby markets in a matter of hours, while newspapers, machine parts, and other goods could be delivered quickly from city suppliers to rural customers. People of modest means could afford to travel to cities for cultural events or to outlying recreational and resort sites such as Lakeside and Cedar Point. And interurban trains permitted out-of-town commuting on a large scale for the first time.\n\nAs rapid was their rise, so too did the interurban railways' fortunes fall.\n\nEven as trolley tracks spiderwebbed across the Midwest's vast farm fields, the technology that would supplant them was being perfected: the automobile.\n\nEarly autos were too expensive for all but the wealthy to afford and too fragile to use on rough rural roads. But Henry Ford's development of the Model T assembly line in 1908 and the spread of roadway paving thereafter soon made automobile travel much more practical.\n\nAs the nation boomed during the 1920s, the interurban rails suffered as travelers began forsaking them for the independence of the private car.\n\nBy 1939, the interurban era in Toledo was dead. That was the year the last Toledo &amp; Indiana car arrived at the Vulcan station, near the University of Toledo, and the last TPC&amp;L service to the downtown interurban station at Jackson and Superior streets ceased.\n\nIn northwest Ohio and southeast Michigan, only traces remain from the heyday of electric rails.\n\nThe University/Parks trail, which runs from the University of Toledo to Secor Metropark, follows the old Toledo &amp; Western right-of-way. The odd angles that Clarion Avenue and Dulton Drive cut across Holland and western Toledo, and the high-tension line that follows those streets, are remnants of the old T&amp;I. And the wide right-of-way along Tremainsville Road dates back to when that thoroughfare was paralleled by an interurban.\n\nBits of right-of-way can be spotted elsewhere in the region. Perhaps the most prominent relic of the interurbans' past is the abandoned Cincinnati &amp; Lake Erie concrete-arch bridge across the Maumee River west of Waterville - commonly known as \"the Old Streetcar Bridge.\"",

        " \n\n&gt;Reasoning:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Humans or other animals could take over that responsibility. If there were no sharks, other animals like dolphins, predatory fish, etc. would simply take over the title of apex predator and keep those populations in check. Or, humans could expand fishing rights or methods to harvest more fish.\n\nSo, this is just changing one apex for another. I see later on where you claim humans aren't (by one definition) an apex predator...I think that's a stretch. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;New Zealand has a goal to become predator free by 2050, so they don\u2019t seem worried about an ecosystem collapse.\n\nI think this is an incorrect reading on the current New Zealand efforts (ETA: this has already been addressed, sorry).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Apex predator populations weed out the sick and weak and keep their populations in check through competition for food and mates. Presumably, non-predator species would do the same over time if predatory pressures were removed.\n\n**Non-predator species** would weed out sick and elderly within populations? How? With negative thoughts?\n\n&gt;Apex predators like the Saber Tooth Tiger have gone extinct without any noticeable ecosystem collapse.\n\nFirst of all, we don't really know the impacts of that extinction...since there aren't scientific studies of the before and after, so your assertion falls flat a bit. \n\nEven if we did - Something like 98% of ALL species that have ever formed are now extinct. Extinction is a very natural occurrence, whether we like it or not. \n\nCan you support your assertion that ecosystem collapse (using your definition) has not in every case been predicated on the loss of an apex predator? Can you show where even a single one has occurred with quantifiable cause and effect?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The studies I\u2019ve seen around decreasing predation highlight short term effects, like a reduction in grassland, but don\u2019t seem to study the effects after multiple generations or the effects of human intervention.\n\nMostly because we don't really know, I assume. I mean, how many apex predators have gone extinct since we (humans) have begun keeping accurate scientific records? How many ecosystem collapses have we overseen?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Sure, ecosystems would change, some significantly, but I don\u2019t see how ecosystems would collapse if dominant apex predators went extinct.\n\nHere is the main point I'd really like to hammer home: Humans are CRAP at understanding and influencing ecosystems. Take a look at the history of our efforts in Lake Erie (I won't even attempt to do this justice in a few words...it's...if it wasn't true, you'd never believe it). Look at similar calamitous impacts we have without even trying. We suck at it. \n\nMore to the point: WHY would you even consider the removal of a species from an ecosystem?",

        "I can try! I didn't really systematize the tuning in any way due to the limitations of FamiTracker. The issue is that the pitch control in FamiTracker doesn't work in cents, but in something called \"pitch units\". As mentioned in [http://forums.famitracker.com/viewtopic.php?t=1399:](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=comments&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbTQyT3AyM2pLVWxKQlhEWnYtMDllYVZ6c2Vld3xBQ3Jtc0ttOTk5QzBMcldsQ0JVUml2R3RkR2Flc0RoY09lTldKZEZVdUdnd2NoTGc2VzI3RS1uZFZwYW13cWVvS0VPd2JKaTh5T1JrRk14emlBc29xWU9NMjMxbk9reUdvZ1dFSXVGNDdCS0otSVBodV9WM3hSbw&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fforums.famitracker.com%2Fviewtopic.php%3Ft%3D1399%3A&amp;stzid=UgxZ4Auv_CNSO31ZpBV4AaABAg.9G8gx2gQgz09G9lUjmL0S-)  \"The NES soundchip doesn't make sound based on semitones or cents or anything of that sort. It does so by division. When you use the pitch effects in FT, you are changing the \"period\". On the NES the period can be between 0 to 2048. The outputted frequency is \"1789773hz / (16(period+1))\"  (The specifics can be found in [http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/APU\\_Pulse](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=comments&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqa3V3dDNsQ2sxSnkySTVvaUFnbVBldGxLbU9vZ3xBQ3Jtc0tsUDJxQmF0ekY5VDE3MUhnR0ZIT0lTbnB6SnVEUFQ3V2x0dndCZHYySHdMTklXM2w4anpTYWJpRW5FYkRzYkV3cE1VcVc1TEJxVmk5cFUyS1JBUUpCUnZROEh0UkNjMVp4eU1UaGN4cTZESjdvODJwaw&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fwiki.nesdev.com%2Fw%2Findex.php%2FAPU_Pulse&amp;stzid=UgxZ4Auv_CNSO31ZpBV4AaABAg.9G8gx2gQgz09G9lUjmL0S-) ). This translates into having really good control of pitch at lower frequencies, but at higher frequencies you lose quite a bit of resolution, and the relationship is rather unintuitive. Detuning a note by one \"pitch unit\" (the minimum amount of change you can make to pitch in FamiTracker) makes a very small difference in lower octaves, but it can be a change of almost one 12-TET semitone once you go to higher octaves. However, I use this throughout the tracks to \"widen up\" chords and intervals, where one same set of detuning instructions for the tracker sounds different when it's transposed to different octaves/registers. This also applies for things like arpeggios/melodies/etc, where the intervals start changing dramatically when you keep transposing them up and down. Therefore, in some sense the sounds float around 12-TET, but it doesn't really ever settle and the size of the tones fluctuates constantly. Ultimately my approach was very experimental, where I manually detuned and/or applied pitch bends to every single note arbitrarily and tried to look for interesting patterns.",

Controllers take no action.\n* 3:32\u00a0p.m. Power shifted by the first failure onto another 345 kV power line, the Hanna-Juniper interconnection, causes it to sag into a tree, bringing it offline as well. While MISO and FirstEnergy controllers concentrate on understanding the failures, they fail to inform system controllers in nearby states.\n* 3:39\u00a0p.m. A FirstEnergy 138 kV line trips in northern Ohio.[\\[16\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_blackout_of_2003#cite_note-16)\n* 3:41\u00a0p.m. A [circuit breaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_breaker) connecting FirstEnergy's grid with that of [American Electric Power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Electric_Power) is [tripped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_breaker) as a 345 kV power line (Star-South Canton interconnection) and fifteen 138 kV lines fail in rapid succession in northern Ohio.\n* 3:46\u00a0p.m. A fifth 345 kV line, the Tidd-Canton Central line, trips offline.\n* 4:05:57\u00a0p.m. The Sammis-Star 345 kV line trips due to under-voltage and over-current interpreted as a short circuit. Later analysis suggests that the blackout could have been averted before this failure by cutting 1.5 GW of load in the Cleveland\u2013Akron area.\n* 4:06\u20134:08\u00a0p.m. A sustained power surge north toward Cleveland overloads three 138 kV lines.\n* 4:09:02\u00a0p.m. Voltage sags deeply as Ohio draws 2 [GW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigawatt) of power from Michigan, creating simultaneous under voltage and over current conditions as power attempts to flow in such a way as to rebalance the system's voltage.\n* 4:10:34\u00a0p.m. Many transmission lines trip out, first in Michigan and then in Ohio, blocking the eastward flow of power around the south shore of [Lake Erie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Erie) from [Toledo, Ohio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toledo,_Ohio), east through [Erie, Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erie,_Pennsylvania), and into southern Erie county, but not most of the [Buffalo, New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York), metropolitan area. Suddenly bereft of demand, generating stations go offline, creating a huge power deficit. In seconds, power surges in from the east, overloading east-coast power plants whose generators go offline as a protective measure, and the blackout is on.\n* 4:10:37\u00a0p.m. The eastern and western Michigan power grids disconnect from each other.

        "I\u2019ve been a bit busy lately so I\u2019ll be holding off on completing the Willow Grove Park story for a week or two while I do some more reading on the 50s and 60s. In its place I\u2019m turning to an interesting little boardwalk park in Toledo, Ohio: Lake Erie Park and Casino.\n\nAs with Willow Grove Park, the word \u2018Casino\u2019 in this era refers to a public building hosting a variety of leisure activities that could include music, dancing, shows, or gambling. Gambling houses were prohibited at this time in Ohio.\n\n[Lake Erie Park and Casino](https://imgur.com/Jwb4IrU.jpg) (expand to full size by adding .jpg, it\u2019s a glorious shot) opened to the public in 1895, [located at the north terminus](https://imgur.com/8yrn0El.png) of a new trolley line. The Casino itself was built on piles over the water, 700 to 1000 FT offshore, at the end of a long boardwalk. The building was three stories tall with [verandas on all sides](https://imgur.com/8ovvUZl.jpg) to look out over Maumee Bay. \n\nIts pastoral setting was a welcome respite from the suffocating pollution of the city, however, at times nature would inflict its own form of pollution. Once a year the boardwalk could be inundated by four to five inches of June bugs, attracted by the electric lights of the boardwalk.\n\nLake Erie Park\u2019s status as a trolley park did not mean its patrons were limited to the city of Toledo. Newspapers in small towns advertised daytrip outings to the park by railroad for $0.75 or $1.00 \u2013 Bucyrus and Delphos in Ohio; Alma, and Homer in Michigan. [The steamer Greyhound](https://imgur.com/49UHN87.jpg) ferried visitors in from Detroit.\n\nThe park\u2019s sole rollercoaster, [L.A. Thompson\u2019s Scenic Railway,](https://imgur.com/PkPJaJU.jpg) was possibly built in 1895 to coincide the grand opening of the casino, but no later than 1901. It was 40 FT tall with a 25 FT drop, and ran parallel to and 75 FT north of the boardwalk/pier. Each run was 800 FT long. [Two cable lift motors](https://imgur.com/N4aAuDv.png) are housed by shacks beneath the tracks in the middle of the pier. As a double out-and-back design, this likely dispels my fantasy of a rollercoaster with a practical transportation function. There is a clearly painted entrance sign on the casino end of the pier. \n\n[The casino itself](https://imgur.com/oSurxzQ.jpg) housed a large theatre with balcony, offering a summer series with eight weeks of dramatic theatre and eight weeks of musical comedy and light opera. The first dramatic production was \u201cWar and Peace,\u201d with tickets going for 25 cents. \n\nVaudeville acts were performed daily with free admission for trolley patrons. Such shows included Madame Vallecita \u2013 performing with lions and panthers, Ricton \u2013 a comedy juggler, and the Streator Zouaves \u2013 a touring drill team in French-North African uniforms who could march at 200 steps per minute, form a 24-man human pyramid, and vault their whole company over a 20 FT wall in under 30 seconds using their rifles as spring bases. \n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that [\u2018Positively no\u2019 horses](https://imgur.com/kD5INtg.jpg) were allowed on the boardwalk.\n\nIn 1901 the Casino would burn down and sink into the marsh. \n\nThe rollercoaster appears to have been unaffected by the fire. [The Casino would be rebuilt](https://imgur.com/AZDhoKY.jpg) for the 1902 season with the barn-like aesthetic seen here. Added to this building were two small octagonal buildings at the end of open-air wings leading north and south. The north building housed an ice cream parlor, the south building housed a bar.\n\nBy this era [there were a number of attractions on the park mainland.](https://imgur.com/OveFFwD.jpg) These included: \u2018The Old Mill &amp; Mystic Chute,\u2019 an enclosed Old Mill ride with 5 FT high ceiling; A caf\u00e9; A dance hall; A bowling alley; A carousel; A photo gallery; The Laughing Gallery fun house;  A shooting gallery; A Kinodrome motion picture building.\n\nIn 1910 the Casino would burn down and sink into the marsh again.\n\nThe fire would completely envelop the casino within ten minutes of its start at around 11:30 PM and would take the whole building down in 45 minutes. Given the late hour, few people were in the building, but several employees made the foolhardy decision to try and save company equipment. Victor Reid, a manager of the Toledo Catering company, attempted to salvage a cash register and was cut off by the flames. Jumping into the water, he made his way to a motorboat, but in the process lost his own pocketbook containing $30 (factoring for inflation, $800).\n\nThe fire was attributed to crossed wiring in the cupula, the small domed structure atop the roof. It would largely spare the rollercoaster but took out half the boardwalk. The Casino was insured but it would not be rebuilt again. The owners had a fallback in Toledo Beach, a newer amusement area just across the border in Michigan, and one with the advantage of three miles of sandy beach. They would collect their insurance payout and continue to develop that park.\n\nEDIT: The more I look at it, the more I think 1895 is too early for this coaster and 1900 or 1901 is a safer bet. Other Scenic Railway trains at the turn of the century have the same canvas roof. There was some conflicting information, but there may have been a 1899 fire as well, so a 1900 opening date would make sense.\n\nEDIT2: Just realized that Picture 7 is mirrored. Corrected it in this comment.",

        "&gt;**Seven Years War**\n\nIn what way was there negligence? This [source](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/when-young-george-washington-started-war-180973076/) while titled \"When Young George Washington Started a War\" does not seem to paint the picture as harshly as you do. Simply put he was following orders under unclear, potentially hostile conditions.\n\n&gt;he [Washington] was a loyal subject of King George II. He and his Virginia Regiment of a little over 100 effective soldiers were the tip of His Majesty\u2019s spear in North America. Their assignment: to finish building a fort that would anchor Britain\u2019s control over the Ohio Valley.\n&gt;\n&gt;But as Washington and his men marched westward over the Appalachian Mountains, they received stunning news: The French had already captured their intended destination, known as Trent\u2019s Fort. Hundreds of French troops had aimed over a dozen cannons at the British soldiers stationed there and forced their surrender.\n&gt; . . . \n&gt;The battle lasted only 15 minutes. At least ten French soldiers fell, most of them killed by Washington\u2019s Indian allies.\n&gt; . . . \n&gt;In the summer of 1753, the French started acting more brazenly. They sent 2,600 soldiers into the region, building a fort on the shore of Lake Erie and another at the headwaters of nearby Le-Boeuf Creek. Both the British officials in Virginia and their Indian allies in Ohio were alarmed.\n&gt;\n&gt;That\u2019s when Washington walked onto the stage of history. At the end of 1753, Virginia governor Robert Dinwiddie asked him to lead a diplomatic expedition to warn the French to leave their forts. ... **Although he wasn\u2019t instructed to start a war, he had the authority to restrain any French interlopers and, if necessary, \u201ckill &amp; destroy\u201d them.**\n\nFurthermore the idea that he was in Ohio for land claims when is wealth was based in Virginia doesn't make much sense.\n\n&gt;I think his support for the revolution was much more about preserving/extending his personal wealth than anything else. \n\nI'm not really going to contest this besides pointing out the fact that the entire revolutionary war was about maintaining wealth from improper seizure. No taxation without representation was the motto. All or most of the Founder were business men who would have been hurt by unfair taxation. As a general note - most revolutions around the world are not \"popular\" uprisings - but start when there's a conflict amount political elites and they recruit more people to their side.\n\n&gt;**He was a brutal slaveowner.**\n\nSlavery in of itself is brutal - but was he a particularly brutal master compared to others? I don't see evidence for it. George had no control over his slaves freedom after his death despite his will.\n\nYou mention the 2 things George is glorified for - his military tenacity in the face of often defeat and uneven odds - and his refusal to take a 3rd presidential term. I want to talk about that 2nd point and emphasize his presidential style.\n\nI  would argue if Washington was truly the overly ambitious - blood thirsty monster you want him to be then he WOULD have taken the 3rd term - he could have if we wanted to, he had the support. But as model of the Roman figure Cincinatus, he abandoned power and returned to his farm for a simple life. That really is an incredible thing to do and a real mark of character. It was such a mark of character that no President would try for a 3rd term until over 100 years later, and only because it was a time of war.\n\nAs for his presidential style - his power did not come from being the smartest guy in the room - his power came from knowing who was smart and more importantly listening to them. He had to be the decider during a time where every choice he made would hinge into the future - no easy task with big names like Madison, Jefferson and Hamilton constantly arguing over what would be good for the country. Many people wanted to give the Chief executive a long list of fancy sounding royal titles, but it was Washington who wanted to be called just President - which is just a simple term for the guy in charge at the moment.  \n\nWashington was not a perfect man - but a more imperfect man could not have done what he had.",

        "Cedar Point Trip Report 7/9/2020 (Part 1):\n\nI finally made it to the holy land of coasters, the Roller Coast, Cedar Point, and though I had a lot of fun, I think it would have been a better idea to wait a week till CP had more staff and more things figured out. Opening day was busy, unorganized, and a little stressful, but coaster heaven can make you forget about those things.\n\nI currently live in the Lehigh Valley of Eastern PA so we left around 1:30 am for the 7-8 hour drive to CP, we made it there around 9, first off the skyline is one of the most impressive things I\u2019ve ever seen. Just hanging out in the parking lot was surreal. Our reservation was for 10:30 AM which I thought was the earliest available time (and still think that), and initially we were in the first 20 people in line to get into the health screening, but since our reservation was \u201ctoo late\u201d we were asked to go to the back of the line behind roughly 1000 people, delaying our entry by about 30 minutes. By the time we got back to the front they weren\u2019t even checking for reservations. Thank you very little ma\u2019am. Enough complaining...for now. \n\nNaturally, we sped walked to Steel Vengeance just like everyone else, and had a decent spot in line, only waited about an hour for it and wow SteVe is a miracle of machinery. I loved it, however, it was so hype that my middle row ride wasn\u2019t actually that impressive, and I still preferred El Toro (for the time being). I\u2019ll get back to Steel Vengeance, but it\u2019s easily 10/10 legendary coaster.\n\nNext we got a ride ticket for Maverick later, and headed to Magnum XL-200 since it was a \u201c25 minute wait\u201d it definitely ended up being longer than that because of sanitizing and a break down. The queue was thankfully well shaded, featuring fans with water misters, and also gives awesome views of Top Thrill Dragster, which is so cool that it\u2019s in the middle of the park, but like many rides was also closed. Magnum in the back row was very fun, strong airtime, but definitely rickety, a little painful, and showing it\u2019s age, so I think I rank it lower than most, 8.5/10, still a very fun ride, the tunnel is awesome. \n\nAfter Magnum I acquired a kiddie credit in Woodstock Express, only went there because there was one family in line so I thought it would be a walk-on, but the ride attendant was the slowest cleaner I have ever seen. She took 2-3 minutes monotonously wiping down every inch of every seat, including the designated social distance ones AND the ones no one previously sat in! Ended up waiting almost 20-25 minutes for it, not to mention the  seatbelts are not good for social distancing at all, as the attendant has to unlock it right up against your body. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m being so pessimistic, but yeah I got the credit so that was nice, but it\u2019s just a Vekoma Junior coaster so 2/10.\n\nThen it was time for our designated slot on Maverick, which I don\u2019t quite understand because we still had to wait in line for about an hour and a half. However, that was another nice queue, and Maverick was the coaster that impressed me the most at CP. The hype behind SteVe was real, but Maverick seems to always play second fiddle, so I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect, but holy s***, it was easily the greatest launch coaster I\u2019ve ever been on. Got back row on this as well, the ejector over the first drop and airtime hill are nuts, and inversions are fun, and that 0-70 launch in 2 second in the tunnel was the most intense launch I\u2019ve ever felt. Let\u2019s not forget that Wave turn...over bank...twisty Stengel dive thing under the lift hill (lmk what it\u2019s called), which was my favorite element on the ride and the whippiest element I have ever felt. Back row on Maverick was one of those life changing rides, what us enthusiasts live for, it gives me chills just thinking about it, 10/10 without a doubt. \n\nNext it was time for Millennium Force, much shorter wait, only about 35-40 minutes. You can tell this ride crew takes pride in their work, because they had the best work ethic when it came to loading, sanitizing, and dispatching. Millie itself...WOW. I know back row is probably great, but we decided to go for the front and holy crap that was insane. This was my first giga, and I remember watching POVs of this years ago thinking omg I\u2019ll never go on that, but of course I did, and that view of Lake Erie, how exposed you feel so high up is amazing. Once you crest that lift hill, it feels like you fall forever, and even get air in the front row. I have no idea how people call this Millennium Forceless because my face felt like I was in an Air Force caliber G-Force simulator. First turn around: intense, first hill: Flo-Jector airtime, over banks: near grey-out, second hill: more flojector. Just an insane ride and easily in my top 10, so underrated among enthusiasts, 9.5/10. \n\nFinally we ended our day with a quick ride on Iron Dragon, my first Arrow Suspended coaster was super fun. The first half was pretty boring, but the swinging you get in the second half was awesome. Solid coaster, too bad these are starting to be a dime a dozen (except for Cedar Fair Parks) 6/10. \n\nWe also wanted to get on Raptor and/or Gatekeeper but the rain started coming in so that was the end of day 1. \n\nWe actually stayed at the Hotel Breakers which was a pain in the butt to get to, because none of the new parking lot employees had any idea where it was (even though I knew where to go) and kept directing us off of the peninsula. Eventually we finally got over to the access road towards Breakers which gives some of the coolest angles of the parks iconic coasters in Millie, Mav, and SteVe. \n\nDay 1 ride count/ranking\nOne ride on each of:\n\n1. Maverick: (for the time being) 10/10\n2. Steel Vengeance: 10/10\n3. Millennium Force: 9.5/10\n4. Magnum XL-200: 8.5/10\n5. Iron Dragon: 6/10\n6. Woodstock Express: 2/10\n\nStay tuned for Part 2 which I will post tomorrow!",

Magnum in the back row was very fun, strong airtime, but definitely rickety, a little painful, and showing it\u2019s age, so I think I rank it lower than most, 8.5/10, still a very fun ride, the tunnel is awesome. \n\nAfter Magnum I acquired a kiddie credit in Woodstock Express, only went there because there was one family in line so I thought it would be a walk-on, but the ride attendant was the slowest cleaner I have ever seen. She took 2-3 minutes monotonously wiping down every inch of every seat, including the designated social distance ones AND the ones no one previously sat in! Ended up waiting almost 20-25 minutes for it, not to mention the  seatbelts are not good for social distancing at all, as the attendant has to unlock it right up against your body. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m being so pessimistic, but yeah I got the credit so that was nice, but it\u2019s just a Vekoma Junior coaster so 2/10.\n\nThen it was time for our designated slot on Maverick, which I don\u2019t quite understand because we still had to wait in line for about an hour and a half. However, that was another nice queue, and Maverick was the coaster that impressed me the most at CP. The hype behind SteVe was real, but Maverick seems to always play second fiddle, so I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect, but holy s***, it was easily the greatest launch coaster I\u2019ve ever been on. Got back row on this as well, the ejector over the first drop and airtime hill are nuts, and inversions are fun, and that 0-70 launch in 2 second in the tunnel was the most intense launch I\u2019ve ever felt. Let\u2019s not forget that Wave turn...over bank...twisty Stengel dive thing under the lift hill (lmk what it\u2019s called), which was my favorite element on the ride and the whippiest element I have ever felt. Back row on Maverick was one of those life changing rides, what us enthusiasts live for, it gives me chills just thinking about it, 10/10 without a doubt. \n\nNext it was time for Millennium Force, much shorter wait, only about 35-40 minutes. You can tell this ride crew takes pride in their work, because they had the best work ethic when it came to loading, sanitizing, and dispatching. Millie itself...WOW. I know back row is probably great, but we decided to go for the front and holy crap that was insane. This was my first giga, and I remember watching POVs of this years ago thinking omg I\u2019ll never go on that, but of course I did, and that view of Lake Erie, how exposed you feel so high up is amazing. Once you crest that lift hill, it feels like you fall forever, and even get air in the front row. I have no idea how people call this Millennium Forceless because my face felt like I was in an Air Force caliber G-Force simulator. First turn around: intense, first hill: Flo-Jector airtime, over banks: near grey-out, second hill: more flojector. Just an insane ride and easily in my top 10, so underrated among enthusiasts, 9.5/10. \n\nFinally we ended our day with a quick ride on Iron Dragon, my first Arrow Suspended coaster was super fun. The first half was pretty boring, but the swinging you get in the second half was awesome. Solid coaster, too bad these are starting to be a dime a dozen (except for Cedar Fair Parks) 6/10. \n\nWe also wanted to get on Raptor and/or Gatekeeper but the rain started coming in so that was the end of day 1. \n\nWe actually stayed at the Hotel Breakers which was a pain in the butt to get to, because none of the new parking lot employees had any idea where it was (even though I knew where to go) and kept directing us off of the peninsula. Eventually we finally got over to the access road towards Breakers which gives some of the coolest angles of the parks iconic coasters in Millie, Mav, and SteVe. \n\nDay 1 ride count/ranking\nOne ride on each of:\n\n1. Maverick: (for the time being) 10/10\n2. Steel Vengeance: 10/10\n3. Millennium Force: 9.5/10\n4. Magnum XL-200: 8.5/10\n5. Iron Dragon: 6/10\n6. Woodstock Express: 2/10\n\nStay tuned for Part 2 which I will post tomorrow!",

        "This is part 2 of a two day trip to CP so if you want to read part 1 go to this link:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/rollercoasters/comments/hpytwa/maverick_cedar_point_maverick_was_unreal_cedar/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\nWe stayed at Hotel Breakers which was very nice, we had an amazing view of the park, and could see almost every coaster. We ate at Friday\u2019s on the property which was good but entirely over priced. Since the park opens later than usual because of COVID, I decided to wake up early to walk along the private beach and boardwalk, to get some shots of the park and go into my first ever Great Lake, Lake Erie. \n\nOn the south side, I got some great shots of GateKeeper and Wicked Twister, and then went up past the hotel to the North end to see all of Magnum XL-200, very nice walk and great way to start my day. Speaking of Magnum, Hotel Breakers offers a unique advantage with the side gate entrance near Magnum, which we utilized, and I ran to Steel Vengeance. As a result I was the very first person in line, got back row, and this time it somehow blew me away even more than before. After this ride I knew it was my number one, knocking El Toro to #2, and Maverick close behind at #3 overall. Steel Vengeance never ever lets up, it\u2019s hard to process the sheer amounts of element after element. It takes multiple rides to truly soak in the unprecedented amount of different forces you feel. Everything gives either tremendous airtime, hangtime, or laterals, and my personally favorite section was the outward-banked airtime hill followed by the first barrel roll. I\u2019m happy to say that I have a new #1 coaster, and his name is SteVe, 10/10.\n\nThe rest of the day was sort of downhill. There were on and off showers 3-4 separate times, delaying operations and hindering coaster credit collection (sounds like an enthusiast bank). Nonetheless we made our way to the B&amp;M\u2019s in the front of the park, first of which was Raptor which was supposed to only be a 45 minute wait, but ended up doubling to an hour and 1/2 wait. The queue for Raptor was very hot, but the wait was worth it. We got a ride towards the back of the train which of course offered some pretty good whip. This invert is very unique, plenty of fun and intense elements, with a decent ride duration, definitely a top 5 invert for me and probably top 5 at CP, 9/10. \n\nAfter Raptor is when Corkscrew opened for the first time on our trip, and once more we waited longer than expected, only to be rained out for the first time that day, and we unfortunately did not get the credit on our trip. Not that Corkscrew would have been that great, on the contrary, but I\u2019ve actually never been on a classic Arrow looper so I was a little bummed out.\n\nWe got Panda Express for lunch and took cover from the rain (and I don\u2019t think I mentioned this yesterday; but we got\nChic-Fil-A for lunch on our first day, and a sandwich is only $5! Regular price is nice to see at a park). \n\nRight after the rain stopped we got in line for Valravn which luckily didn\u2019t take long to reopen, we waited maybe 25 minutes which was a relief. We got a front row ride, which is the move on dive coasters, but guess what...it started to rain again! This time there was no thunder and lightning thankfully so we still got on, but the rain (which was a bit more than a drizzle) was pretty painful. This was my first experience with the newer B&amp;M vest restraints and I can see why people don\u2019t like them. Unlike S&amp;S and Vekoma vest restraints which are light and have some give to them, the B&amp;M vests are tight, heavy, and hold you right in place, which is totally unnecessary and a little annoying. The vests definitely took away some of what could have been an amazing dive coaster, but nonetheless, I had a lot of fun on it. I still prefer SheiKra, but Valravn definitely has a longer and better layout, it\u2019s a shame about the restraints. Drop was amazing, Immelmann was good, but I really loved the corkscrew and airtime hill, solid coaster, bad restraints, 8.5/10. \n\nNext we went to GateKeeper which was long overdue. I had never been on a wing coaster so I was very excited for this, but when we got there the ride was down and the line was out the station, yet we all wanted to get on it so we waited...and waited...and after about an hour in line I decided I wanted to go to a gift shop because it was already almost 6:00, our last day at CP quickly dwindling, and I bought this nice model Parkscape of the Cedar Point Skyline for about $30, totally worth it, and the only souvenir I got at the park, but as I spent about 20 minutes there, my group was being let into Gatekeeper, and they actually got 2 rides without me. Naturally I was pretty angry, but I ran back over, luckily got on, and I must say it was such a fun ride! I sat in the 6th row on the right side of the train, and I think wing coasters are pretty underrated. I sort of forgot the the first drop was an inversion which took me by surprise, got some nice floater on the hill, crazy near misses with the keyholes, but I think my favorite element was the corkscrew before the keyholes which felt like the fastest section of the ride. On top of the ride experience, GateKeeper is one of the most beautiful coasters I\u2019ve ever seen, and it\u2019s the perfect way to greet guests into the park, very cool ride, and even though its tied with Valravn, I much preferred GateKeeper. Luckily, I was on the last train before it broke down again, but I got stuck on the brake run for about 15 minutes, but felt like an hour since the park close was nearing. They gave me a free ride ticket though that I hopefully can use again on my next visit. The vests didn\u2019t bother me as much on GateKeeper so 8.5/10 for sure. \n\nThis time my friends waited for me, and I wanted to try and get on Corkscrew before the day was done, but they hadn\u2019t had a good ride on Millennium Force the day before so we agreed to go there instead, but right on queue rain clouds returned, and we got drenched waiting for Millie. We waited about half an hour till 7:30, when we heard thunder again and knew it would not reopen. Definitely not how we wanted to end our visit, but I really can\u2019t complain about the quality of coasters we got on at Cedar Point.\n\nWhen it comes to coaster collections, parks are either Quality or Quantity, but Cedar Point is a rare park which has both. It really is a place like no other, and I can\u2019t wait to go back and get the rest of the credits I couldn\u2019t get this time, especially since season passes are now good through 2021 I believe. Even though the weather literally rained on our parade, I still am so thankful I was finally able to go here, but on my next visit I will definitely buy a Fast Lane Plus, because that\u2019s what made our next day at Kings Island so much better...

        "I've lived in Windsor my whole life, so I know the city fairly well. Is it great? No. Is it as bad as some people say? No.\n\nTransportation:\n\nWindsor is very much a car city. The public transit here is a joke compared to other cities and the roads here are fairly easy to navigate so you'll definitely want a car\n\nEntertainment: \n\nWindsor is pretty 'meh' when it comes to finding things to do. There have been some decent restaurants popping up lately in the city and visiting the beautiful riverfront, casino and some of the bars and night clubs downtown can be fun. The downtown core of Windsor is pretty empty and vacant other than bars, clubs and the casino. That's generally the only reason to visit downtown. There is a decent amount of walking and biking trails in the city if you're into that \n Compared to Calgary, it may feel like a bit of a downgrade in that area.\n\nEconomy: \n\nWindsor's economy is mainly focused on one thing: cars,cars,cars. Unfortunately the union leaders here can't seem to learn from what happened to Detroit over the past 70 years (who is now diversifying their economy and creating many new tech and manufacturing jobs). Unfortunately for us in Windsor, the FCA assembly plant is the largest employer in the city (literally everyone knows someone who works there) and things aren't looking so good for it. Nobody is buying the Chrysler Pacifica (the only product manufactured there) and They just eliminated the midnight shift, leaving 1300+ out of a job. This also negatively affects the supplier plants of the FCA plant, so more layoffs are likely to ensue. Aside from blue collar work, there aren't many options here and many have to move away to find work. \n\nCost of living: \n\nOne major advantage Windsor has compared to many other places in Ontario, or the entire country is the cheap cost of living. In Windsor you can find rentals for $800 or $900 per month if you're lucky, and a decent sized house will cost you around $300k, although costs are steadily rising here. Compared to most other cities this is a total bargain.\n\nWeather: \n\nBeing one of the southernmost places in Canada, Windsor has very hot and humid summers from June through September. In most cases you'll be able to experience autumn and spring as separate seasons without them being blended together into summer and winter. Our Winters here can get pretty cold, but probably nowhere near as bad as Calgary. In recent years we haven't gotten much snow, and generally the temperature doesn't go below -10\u00b0C.\n\nDetroit:\n\nAnother great advantage of living in Windsor is the proximity to Detroit. On a day with good traffic you can drive to the USA in about 10 or 15 minutes (that's if the US customs doesn't give you a hard time) Downtown Detroit has plenty of things to do, many great bars, restaurants and trendy areas emerging to satisfy any \"big city\" cravings. The whole of downtown Detroit is fairly revitalized, safe and pretty walkable, although do take caution when visiting other areas outside of downtown. The metro Detroit area has great shopping options such as the Great lakes crossing outlet mall \n\nTravel options:\n\nTravel options in Windsor are quite good imo. You can take a plane from the Windsor Airport to pretty much any larger Canadian city (Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, etc) and it also offers seasonal routes to the carribean through Sunwing airlines. Generally, if you're looking for trans continental flights, you can drive on down to the Detroit Wayne County Metropolitan Airport and fly basically anywhere, and the best part is that it's cheaper than flying out of Toronto Pearson. In terms of land travel, you can take Greyhound buses as far as Montreal and Sudbury and everything in between, and the highways in southern Ontario are very easy to navigate\n\nGeography and surrounding area: \n\nWindsor is oddly situated, resting against south eastern Michigan. Sometimes the area can feel a bit claustrophobic as the only way there is to go within Canada is back North, or to go into the US. Windsor is situated within Essex County, a very very flat and deforested landscape. Compared to Calgary I would certainly say the geographical landscape here is a downgrade considering Banff is an hour away from Calgary. Within Essex county there are some other small towns worth checking out such as Amherstburg, a historical town playing a major role in the war of 1812, Kingsville/Leamington, two towns largely comprised of agricultural greenhouses, and some beautiful wineries along Lake Erie, and Belle river, a cute town where many jetski, sail or kyak on lake St. Clair.",

        "I realized I didn\u2019t have enough room to write in labels for this piece so here\u2019s a little description I came up with as I was drawing this out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBa Nonera, the city hidden in the Nonelle River Valley, was founded in the twelfth century of the Sleeping Autumn Era by Hogart Lomrell I, leader of the Lomrell Tribe. Legends say Hogart followed the cry of a red tailed hawk sent by the Goddess of Sunset Tears, Nonera, which led him to the hidden valley. There, he and his tribesmen erected the foundations of what would later become the Grand Promenade on the western bank of the river. In his later years, Hogart ordered construction of the Hawk Span, the great arcing bridge which connects either side of the city. Hogart never lived to see its completion, but his sigil, the Flying Hawk, was placed as a giant statue on the bridge in his memory.\n\nCenturies passed and the city grew higher and higher up the valley cliffs in great tiers which separated the wealthy aristocracy and the simple fishermen. The city eventually would fall under siege during the reign of Droor the Unworthy. Though the city was sacked by invading barbarians, its citizens were able to rebuild and reinforce the city\u2019s defences so such an invasion could never again happen. Nowadays, many secret passageways crisscross under the ancient foundations of the city, through its sewers and catacombs and out into the river. The Fortress of Timril on the western shore and its Iron Battery now stand guard over the river. The eastern sector of the city holds the Hawk Keep which rests above all other tiers of the valley.   From down on the riverbank one can only see its high arcing walls. It is in the Hawk Keep that the current ruler, King Jorook Lominrelldrin II, oversees the river valley.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, this is just a fun little story to keep myself entertained as I was creating this piece so not too much thought went into it. I hope you enjoy exploring the city for yourself though and make up your own lore for it.  \n\n\n  \n\\*\\*EDIT\\*\\*  \nBelow is a link to see a full scan of the map. \n\n[https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/08b00aa5-e6e8-4468-bbfc-37b5e6fc58e8/de1letv-09cb651f-e70c-4871-9aa8-331388c5eb03.jpg/v1/fill/w\\_1024,h\\_778,q\\_75,strp/ba\\_nonera\\_by\\_chris\\_h94\\_de1letv-fullview.jpg?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOiIsImlzcyI6InVybjphcHA6Iiwib2JqIjpbW3siaGVpZ2h0IjoiPD03NzgiLCJwYXRoIjoiXC9mXC8wOGIwMGFhNS1lNmU4LTQ0NjgtYmJmYy0zN2I1ZTZmYzU4ZThcL2RlMWxldHYtMDljYjY1MWYtZTcwYy00ODcxLTlhYTgtMzMxMzg4YzVlYjAzLmpwZyIsIndpZHRoIjoiPD0xMDI0In1dXSwiYXVkIjpbInVybjpzZXJ2aWNlOmltYWdlLm9wZXJhdGlvbnMiXX0.sJ8\\_9bLaWZ-ueXCpWWteNYDMLgbUAzLzpufpgDDCtSo](https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/08b00aa5-e6e8-4468-bbfc-37b5e6fc58e8/de1letv-09cb651f-e70c-4871-9aa8-331388c5eb03.jpg/v1/fill/w_1024,h_778,q_75,strp/ba_nonera_by_chris_h94_de1letv-fullview.jpg?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOiIsImlzcyI6InVybjphcHA6Iiwib2JqIjpbW3siaGVpZ2h0IjoiPD03NzgiLCJwYXRoIjoiXC9mXC8wOGIwMGFhNS1lNmU4LTQ0NjgtYmJmYy0zN2I1ZTZmYzU4ZThcL2RlMWxldHYtMDljYjY1MWYtZTcwYy00ODcxLTlhYTgtMzMxMzg4YzVlYjAzLmpwZyIsIndpZHRoIjoiPD0xMDI0In1dXSwiYXVkIjpbInVybjpzZXJ2aWNlOmltYWdlLm9wZXJhdGlvbnMiXX0.sJ8_9bLaWZ-ueXCpWWteNYDMLgbUAzLzpufpgDDCtSo)",

        "I lived in Cleveland for several years.  I always said that Cleveland isn't a \"big Buffalo\" like some think, but like a mix of \"uncanny valley\" Buffalo, with Rochester also thrown in for good measure.  \n\n**GEOGRAPHY / URBANISM**\n\n* **West Side** (city + suburbs west of the Cuyahoga River) = traditionally blue collar, white ethnic and Hispanic (like Buffalo, mainly Puerto Rican).  **75% Buffalo, 25% Rochester**.  Representing the West Side: Drew Carey.\n* **East Side** (east of the Cuyahoga) = traditionally white collar and old money, Jewish, Anglo, Italian, and also home to Cleveland's large African-American community.  **75% Rochester, 25% Buffalo**.  Representing the East Side: the late Harvey Pekar.\n\n**East Side of Cleveland proper**= if urban blight in Buffalo was somehow concentrated *west* of Main Street, in \"good\" neighborhoods.\n\n**West Side of Cleveland proper** = if areas east of Main Street never experienced racial change.\n\nThe East Side/West Side rivalry is like a far more intense version of the Northtowns/Southtowns divide. \n\nThe inner ring East Side suburbs, especially Cleveland Heights, used to be *the* place to live for the 20-30something crowd.  In the past 20 years, it seems like Cleveland's young professionals have changed sides, or are more evenly split.  /r/cleveland is all about the West Side, specifically the City of Lakewood.  East Side?  The Heights/Hillcrest 'burbs are so 20th century, and many see their lack of expressways as a *negative*.  \"You can't get here from here.\"   Young Clevelanders seem to love \"I-90\" and \"the Innerbelt\", or at least be ambivalent about them, as much as young Buffalonians despise \"the 33\" and \"the 198\".\n\nNicer downtown, shittier city neighborhoods, MUCH nicer and more \"polished\" suburbs with more of a Northtowns or leafier suburban Rochester feel overall.  Proportionately fewer village-like areas.  Cleveland's old money crowd is entirely in the eastern suburbs, unlike Buffalo where they're still mostly in the city. Lower-middle class neighborhoods in the city feel a bit nicer than their Buffalo equivalents (more inner Cheektowaga-ish than Riverside- or South Park-like), but there's also proportionally more poorer areas and blight.  There's only a very small middle class presence in the city, and almost no upper-middle or upper income areas.  (Bratenahl, a wealthy lakefront neighborhood, is a separate city.)  tl;dr: the Cleveland area feels more \"suburbanized\" than Buffalo, culturally speaking.\n\nMy ex-girlfriend (proud suburban West Side Clevelander) thought that \"Buffalonians use their neighborhoods a LOT more.\"  I remember those exact words.  She thought there were a LOT more people out and about on the streets in Buffalo's city neighborhoods.  \n\nNo equivalent to Elmwood Village, Allentown, Hertel Avenue/North Buffalo, etc. in the area.    Likewise, Buffalo has no equivalent to Shaker Heights or the ultra-wealthy Chagrin Valley / Geauga County \"gentleman's estates\" area.\n\n(City of) Lakewood = a big Kenmore, but with a lot of bars, and a strong Irish-American presence.  Lakewood love is a trademark /r/Cleveland circlejerk.\n\n(City of) Cleveland Heights - leafier North Buffalo / Parkside, more Park Avenue in Rochester-ish.\n\n(City of) South Euclid =  a dead ringer for Tonawanda around Colvin Avenue.\n\n(Cities of) University Heights, Lyndhurst = Brighton (suburban Rochester).\n\n(Village of) Chagrin Falls = East Aurora.\n\n(Cities of) Parma, Seven Hills = somewhat nicer version of Cheektowaga.\n\n(City of) Beachwood = 14221, with a but of an edge city feel.  It has one of the largest concentrations of Reform and Conservative Jews in the US, even including NYC/Long Island.\n\n(City of) Shaker Heights = Middlesex Parkway x 100, plus some Snyder/Eggertsville.\n\n(City of) Bay Village - Snyder / Eggertsville, if it were on Lake Erie.\n\nKamm's Corners (West Side) = South Buffalo.  \n\nOhio City (West Side) = What Broadway-Fillmore would be like if it gentrified, instead of turned to urban prairie.\n\nTremont = more gentrified Five Points.\n\nThe Cleveland area has much more urban sprawl than its size would suggest.  It's a 90 minute drive from Painesville to Medina, on freeways, in good traffic.  Traffic moves quickly, but it's not a \"20 minute city\".  Traffic enforcement is very strict, and you have to learn what areas are more Kenmore-like in that regard -- Cleveland Heights, Linndale (a tiny enclave that's  entirely surrounded by the City of Cleveland), etc.\n\n**RACE / ETHNICITY**\n\nRace relations were both uneasier than in Buffalo (bigger riots, more \"race conscious\" for lack of a better term), but also better at the same time (intentional integration of inner ring eastern suburbs in the 1960s, which still remain diverse).  Proportionally, the Cleveland area has a much larger black middle/upper middle class/professional community than Buffalo.  \n\nThe Cleveland areas has a MUCH larger Jewish population --  80-90K, compared to 10K (down from 25K at its peak) in Buffalo.  It has a sizeable but proportionally smaller Polish-American population (despite their recent embrace of Dyngus Day), and a much larger Croatian/Serbian/Hungarian presence (more \"vitch\" and \"vic\" than \"ski\" and \"czak\").  Good-sized Irish-American (more on the West Side) and Italian-American (more on the East Side) populations.  \n\nCleveland has a *real* Chinatown, with a concentration of Chinese restaurants, small supermarkets, Asian plazas/malls, and the like.  It's not a vibrant NYC/Toronto-style Chinatown, though.  It feels like a semi-residential/semi-industrial part of Riverside/Black Rock.\n\nCleveland was a major destination on the \"Hillbilly Highway\" for migrants from Appalachia, unlike Buffalo. People with Appalachian roots are kind of an \"invisible minority\".  \"[fill in the blank]-tucky\" areas include some mixed residential/industrial neighborhoods on the city's West side, and parts of Akron and Painesville.  (Ashtabula has a HUGE Appalachian-American community.) \n\n**ECONOMY**\n\nMuch larger Fortune 500 presence; both headquarters and branch offices / operations.  However, Columbus has a much faster growing economy.  When it comes to economic power, Cleveland sees Pittsburgh as their peer city or rival.\n\nCleveland got hit MUCH harder in the Great Recession than Buffalo. Home prices were fairly low as it was, but dropped by more than half in some neighborhoods, including upscale suburbs like Shaker Heights and Beachwood. \n\nCleveland gets a lot of national retail chains years (or even decades) before Buffalo, but long after the Columbus market is saturated.  There's collective angst over Cleveland's lack of an IKEA store, like how Buffalonians wonder why Costco avoids WNY like the plague. \n\n**EDUCATION**\n\nBuffalo city public schools are MUCH better than Cleveland public schools.  Suburban districts: Buffalo still has the edge.  House hunters in Cleveland are far more obsessed with school districts than in Buffalo, though.\n\nBuffalo seems to have a greater concentration of colleges/universities and students.  CWRU could be seen as an equivalent to U of R.  For the Jesuits, John Carroll &gt; Canisius. UB &gt;&gt; Cleveland State. Cleveland doesn't have the little Catholic colleges in practically every neighborhood, unlike Buffalo.  Notre Dame in South Euclid is their equivalent of Medaille, D'Youville, Daemen, Villa Maria, Hilbert, etc.\n\nAccording to the Federal Reserve branch in Cleveland, [Buffalo and Pittsburgh have a more educated population than Cleveland or Detroit](https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/publications/economic-commentary/2013-economic-commentaries/ec-201306-urban-decline-in-rust-belt-cities.aspx).  \n\n&gt; Cleveland and Detroit had the lowest proportion of residents over the age of 25 with a college degree or higher in 1970 (4 percent and 6 percent, respectively), and both experienced relatively small gains in this share by 2006, leaving both at about 12 percent. In contrast, **Buffalo and Pittsburgh were slightly more highly educated in 1970 (7 percent and 9 percent, respectively) but are now much more highly educated (20 percent and 31 percent, respectively)**.\n\n**CULTURE**\n\nCleveland is a Midwestern city, despite its Connecticut roots.  When kids go to college, they generally look westward rather than to the Northeast. \n\nCleveland accents are a bit more Buffalo/Detroit sounding east of the Cuy-uh-HO-guh, more Chicago-ish west of the Cuy-uh-HAWW-guh.  Not nearly as ear-splitting nasal.  You'll hear some Yinzer-isms (\"The car needs washed\") in Lake County.\n\nClevelanders often refer to upscale suburbs by just the first word in the name.  \"Pepper\" (Pike), \"Shaker\" (Heights), \"Bay\" (Village), etc.  \n\nBuffalo has a much stronger sense of identity than Cleveland, and a much more distinctive and quirkier local culture.  I can't think of any kinds of food that are uniquely \"Cleveland\" -- they like corned beef sandwiches a lot, but that's about it.  \n\nCleveland is less culturally Catholic -- fish fry is mostly just a Lent thing (and it's perch), no lawn fetes, and no \"where are your ashes?\" or \"what parish do you live in?\"  Diocese news isn't as front-and-center in the local news media.  \n\nCleveland's idea of blue collar culture matches Buffalo's in some ways (bowling, Browns fandom, strong unions, socially conservative but fiscally left-leaning \"lunchbucket Democratic\" politics), but not in others (no VFDs, no picnic groves, less bingo, weekends at Put-In-Bay, travel destinations that includes more than just Sarasota / Myrtle Beach / DR). \n\nClevelanders imported Dyngus Day from Buffalo, and now embrace it like it's their own quirky holiday. \n\nHigh school football and basketball are far more popular than in WNY, but not quite as popular as in Texas.  TV news in Cleveland give HS sports a lot of attention. Nobody cares about hockey or lacrosse.\n\nA lot of people from Cleveland take road trips to ski at Holiday Valley, and many have cottages on Chautauqua Lake.  Cottages in Michigan are also popular.",

        "I lost both my jobs in the same month. And could no longer afford North NJ. I had lived there for the majority of my life, my family was there too. \n\nBut I had absolutely nothing to lose. I put my excess stuff in storage. And then packed my car with stuff I\u2019d need and use. I got a map, closed my eyes and pointed. I landed on Upstate NY. \n\nSo I drove out to NY. But went thru PA and a little bit of Ohio. I drove all around NY, visiting different sites, parks.\n\nI ended up at a public library a few days later and again closed my eyes and pointed. \nLanded on Jamestown. \n\nI got on Craigslist to see how much rent would be. I was shocked that it was so cheap. \n\nI ended up renting a MIL type apt over the landlords home garage in a little town near Jamestown.\n\nI loved it so much. \n\nDown the road there was a cow farm. A bit further were horses. \nThe Amish would click clack by every morning around 4am. And every night like around 7pm.\nThe birds would be singing right outside my bedroom window around 4:30am, every day.\nThe view I had of the sunset from my living room window was just beautiful. \nWhen winter came, oh my Gwad it was just breathtaking. I lived in NJ, snow stays white for about 3 minutes. Then it\u2019s grey slush. And it\u2019s just a nuisance. \nBut up there, feet of snow and it was like winter wonderland. \n\nOn one of my little road trips after I moved there, I found this little beach off of Lake Erie. I went there a lot during the summer and most of the time, I was the only one there. \n\nJamestown always had Farmers Market every weekend (if I remember right). \n\nThis absolutely wonderful Amish family would always sell their baked goodies every weekend.\n\nThere was this little sandwich and pizza shop too. That was so unexpectedly good. \n\nThere were little shops, a pub I totally loved, a clothing store I\u2019d go to all the time. And the shop owner had this dog. And it helped me get over my fear of dogs! \n\nThe first day when I got to the apt I would end up renting. The landlords dog appeared and began running towards me. I was petrified, I just ran, screaming in terror, back to my car, jumped in. \nOMG. What a sight I must have been lol! \n\nAnd with the Landlords dog, lol, it\u2019s like he knew that I was scared. So he\u2019d actually stay at a distance. One time I couldn\u2019t believe it, but he was peeking at me from the side of the house. I actually took a picture of him doing it! Lol!\n\nBut that dog at the shop, it took months. But I finally was able to hold him in my hands with out fear. \n\nAnd when my bf was finally stationed in the States and was with me. We actually played with the landlords dog. \n\nSo I was only there like a year. Because then my bf and I got married, at the Courthouse in Jamestown. The Judge was so awesome, lol. \n\nAnd we moved to Virginia. \n\nBut I loveeeeed living up there in NY. I was able to decompress. Create art. Did a lot of jewelry designs. \n\nThe only negative I had. Driving back to NJ to visit family. It would take me like 2 days of driving because I\u2019d need to stop every few hours. I was paranoid of driving too long and crashing, lol. And some of the roads were terrifying! \n\nBut one day on one of my little trips, I wanted to go to Buffallo for something. I can\u2019t remember why. But somehow the shitty Magellan GPS thing (This was before iPhones) so I would use a map map and the spotty GPS. It sent me to Canada! \nI was like why do I have to pay a toll? Why are signs in French? Why is Magellan (I named him Gerard), wht was Gerard glitching. \nThen I finally get to the weird toll booth. That was border patrol. Lol. Was very embarrassing explaining that Magellan sent me this way to get to Buffalo. Lol. Then all lanes were stopped and I had to drive in front of the other cars to get to the going to America side. \nThe patrol guy was like, you need to be careful, sometimes those GPS can send you into the wrong places. So just be aware. \n\nI was like that is good point. And actually later. Driving back from NJ and it was like 3am. I came up on some thick fog. And the GPS was showing there was a river right near to where I was supposed to be driving. The fog was so thick and I got scared that I might end up in the water. I turned around and parked in a parking lot for like 2 hours, when the fog was gone and it was turning into morning. \n\nAnyway. That\u2019s my story.\n\nI hope whatever you choose to do, you have some fun, meet some good people along the way, and just get to chill out a bit and enjoy.\n\n\nOh BTW We got to Virginia and about a year later we adopted a dog from the SPCA! We have 4, well 3 now.  But I went from being legit terrified of dogs (all animals really) to having 4 and them being my babies!",

        "Property values have actually slowly been going up. The funny thing is that it's Canadians that are purchasing  up all these downtown properties and rehabbing them. Buffalo's real estate market has been booming for most of the last decade and one of the hottest in the US. That, along with Toronto's rapidly growing population and rent/housing prices, have made it so that Niagara Falls, NY is starting to get squeezed in between the two markets, causing our rents and housing market to start to rise. I have been looking at buying house for a while now, and neighborhoods that I have been looking at have had houses go up for an extra $10-20k thousand. The immediate area around the falls and gorge on the Ontario side is some of the most valuable real estate in Canada (partly because most of the best areas have already been developed and the rest is being sat on by real estate investors). So all these Canadian businessmen are buying up properties on our side of the Falls because it's more economically viable (even with the high NY state taxes) and the Canadian side is close to getting maxed out.\n\nPlus just because the Canadian side developed their side of Niagara Falls into a skyline of hotel skyscrapers doesn't mean it's not a camping destination. Camping is actually a very popular and affordable way to visit the falls on our side, all of the campgrounds are booked up in the summer (I can think of four very successful campgrounds within 10-20 minutes of the Falls off the top of my head: Four Mile Creek State Park, Grand Island KOA, Lewiston KOA, Niagara Campground and a bit farther out is Golden Hills State Park). There is whole industry of guided tours that operate by picking up people from the campgrounds and driving them around all the different state parks and scenic spots.\n\nBecause there is a city on either side of the Falls also doesn't excuse the fact that the main point of visiting Niagara Falls should be to actually see the Falls and spend time outdoors exploring the gorge or river. A big part of the attraction in coming to Niagara Falls is, well to see Niagara Falls. All the stuff on Clifton Hill and Lundy's Lane is there for the people who really don't give a shit about checking the falls and just want to go gamble. The whole reason all that stuff is there and why the Canadian side was so heavily developed with casinos, strip clubs, arcades and all of that is because they actually don't have close access to the falls and gorge like the  US side too. They definitely have a better  overall view, but because of the steepness of the gorge, you can't really access anything besides the Niagara Glenn. Even the White Water Walk charges you to to get close to the rapids ($16.50 Canadian per person), but you can get that same exact view and even closer to the water by just following the trail from the Gorge Discovery center on the NY side. I think this is one of the major differences in the two sides, on the Canadian side they charge people just to get down to the bottom of the gorge and close to the white water rapids (pulling more tourism money into the region), while that same exact view is totally free since it's located on NY state land (which is funded by the state tax payers). It's hard to increase an tourism economy when they aren't charging visitors to come down and experience that view of the white water rapids (which is actually kind of crazy since you can get even closer to the water on the NY side than you can with the White Water Walk on the ON side). Charging people to access these views is something that conservationists fought against a century ago (when the stretch of land along the gorge/river was privately owned and you were charged a fee just to get a glimpse of the falls, river and gorge). Charging people for stuff like this just totally goes against the whole point of having a state park there, even if it would benefit the city more.\n\nShit, people spend all day down in the gorge fishing, rock climbing and hiking/exploring without ever coming up till the sun sets. So while camping and doing outdoors stuff (like you would at a National Park) might not be a big thing on the Canadian side, it absolutely is on the American side.\n\n The funny thing about that too is all the state parks on the US side are actually a part of the US National Park system. All the state parks going from Niagara Falls, down to Lake Ontario have been incorporated into the Niagara Falls National Heritage Area back in 2008. Final decision making and control is still in the hands of the NY State Parks, but the National Parks Service is now helping plan out/elaborate on new outdoor recreation opportunities, connecting together the state parks into one unified park system and provide public out reach when it comes to stuff like Niagara Falls history, tourism directed at people wanting to spend time outdoors here and other stuff like that. It's a big part of the reason why the Robert Moses Parkway is getting torn out and all the immediate state parks along the river and close to the Falls are getting turned into one long stretch of green space.\n\n It is still a world famous natural destination and a ton of people come out here to spend time outdoors. You don't have to just go camping to enjoy the outdoors is my point. Fishing charters is a big industry in WNY, a ton of people come just to go fishing in the Niagara river and Lake Erie/Ontario (since we have some of the highest recorded sizes for fish species like small mouth bass or lake trout). There is the historic tourism industry that is built around things like visiting Fort Niagara, the Underground Railroad Museum, the Schoelkopf hydro plant ruins at the bottom of the gorge, the Devils Hole Massacre and other stuff like that.\n\nI have two more last points. One is that you don't necessarily need to go camping to enjoy spending time outdoors when visiting a National Park. Most of the major and most famous National Parks in the US actually have huge wait times for booking a campsite, with most of them full and booked way in advanced. If you can get a campsite at a National Park like Yellowstone, Yosemite, the Smoky Mountains or Shenandoah during the peak tourism summer months, then you really got lucky. I have visited just about every National Park  on the East Coast of the US (only three that I haven't been to yet are Acadia, Everglades and Congaree).The only time I have actually been camping inside one of the parks is when I booked a campsite at Shenandoah and the Smoky Mountains way in advanced. Otherwise my family and I have just stayed in hotels, motels, AirBnbs and then drove into the park to spend the day doing shit outdoors.\n\nThe other point is, if you spend a lot of time visiting the National Parks (at least in the US), you will find that more often than not, they are surrounded by poorer and less well off economically strapped cities or towns. While a lot of money does get pulled in through tourism, the downside is that the local city/towns are sacrificing a lot of economic activity by hosting such large tracts of preserved/conserved land that can't be developed. Just like Niagara Falls, these National Parks and the tourism industry that comes with it are often the only major source of jobs for that region. Yosemite and Yellowstone may be better off since they are flagships of the National Park Service, but they are the exception to the rule. Yosemite and Yellowstone are surrounded by a lot of wealthy people who want to live or have a vacation home close. If you visit any of the slightly lesser known but still grand parks, you are going to find that some of the bordering communities are poorer and even in worst shape than Niagara Falls, NY. Shit, Cuyahoga National Park is just a half hour outside of Cleveland and that's a real big city with major poverty/economic issues. When I visited there last year, it was just impoverished farm land and post-industrial brown fields once you left the actual park. \n\nHere is the link to the Niagara Falls National Heritage Area section of the US National Park Service's website:\n\nhttps://www.nps.gov/nifa/index.htm",

        "My favorite things about Rochester:\n\n* Going to a Rochester Red Wings Triple A Baseball Game. They are the farm team for the Minnesota Twins. They have great promotions and themes for the games and generally get a good turnout, especially in the summer months. They turn into the \"Rochester Plates\" on Thursdays, with various 'garbage plate' themed food items. The food venues, atmosphere, and production are top notch.\n* Getting meat to grill/smoke or prepared food from McCann's Local Meats. This place has everything. Most recently they made Cool Ranch Doritos sausages that were absolutely incredible. All the meat is sourced locally and is truly a treat. Dry aged steaks, sausages, bacon, chicken wings, and burgers (including bacon/beef, bone marrow/beef, dry aged beef and more) are among some of my favorites there. They have an extensive prepared food menu with one of the best 'garbage plates' in Rochester. I have always been completely satisfied with every penny spent there. Their steak plate Friday special and Cuban sandwich are my go tos from the cafe.\n* Going for a drive on Lake Rd. This is a road that runs parallel to Lake Ontario on the East Side. It's great for a joy ride and to stop at some parks along the way. Some pretty impressive houses as well.\n* Getting ice cream at Abbott's or Lugia's. Abbott's is a local treat that it known for it's frozen custard. Lugia's is in Spencerport/Ogden area and is known for their massive ice cream cones that would topple over if you don't be careful. They are also known for long lines in the summer so order ahead!\n* Walking along the canal path in Bushnells Basin, Fairport, Shoen Plac (Pittsford), or Greece Canal Park. The Erie Canal is a huge part of Rochester and upstate NY history. There are paths all over. The ones in the villages it's nice to grab an iced coffee or ice cream and take a walk with your family, S.O. or a friend. But can bike or run as well.\n* Going to the Seneca Park Zoo. They recently expanded the zoo and have a ton of great animals there. They do Zoo Brews as well if you're into that kind of thing but I like going during the day when the animals are out.\n* Visiting the local parks. Personal favorites are Cobbs Hill, Highland, Turning Point, Corbett's Glenn, Mendon Ponds and Basil Marella Parks. There are a TON.\n* Driving up to Lake Ontario. Hamlin Beach, Webster Park, Charlotte and Durand are a few spots. If you move further East there's Sodus, Chimney Bluffs, and Fair Haven that are all very nice.\n* Local festivals - My favorites are Park Avenue, Jazz, and Lilac Festivals. The area is known for its summer festivals. There are a bunch more as well.\n* Local concerts - Main Street Armory and Photo City Improv are a few venues here I go to a bit. There's also bigger shows at Blue Cross Arena and then Darien Lake PAC between here and Buffalo. The biggest local concerts tend to be in Buffalo at the Keybank Center where the Sabres play. I've seen the following artists in Rochester (all separate concerts): Wiz Khalifa, 2 Chainz, Rich Homie Quan, Juicy J, Meek Mill, Future (2x), Jeezy, Nas, Lil Boosie, J. Cole, Rae Sremmurd, Lil Wayne, Gucci Mane, Migos, Illenium, and more. In Buffalo/Darien, I've seen (all separate concerts): Drake (2x), Lil Wayne, Drake/Lil Wayne, ASAP Rocky, JAY-Z, Travis Scott/Young Thug, Tyler The Creator, Chris Brown, Drake/Future, Kanye West, 3LAU, Matoma, Said The Sky, Dave Matthews Band and J. Cole/Young Thug. So plenty of rap and EDM which is what I like. There is a ton of rock and country concerts as well. CMAC and Saratoga Springs (further east) are a couple other amphitheaters that will cater more to those tastes.\n* Going to Tinseltown, the best movie theater in Rochester for a movie. They have IMAX which is the only one in the area.\n* Amusement Parks - Seabreeze and Darien Lake (between Rochester and Buffalo) - I went to these a lot more as a kid but went to Seabreeze last year and had a blast.\n* Run in a local race. My favorites are the Lilac Run and Webster Turkey Trot.\n\nYou also have Buffalo and hour or so away, Professional sports teams, great food and history, and a nice harbor/waterfront area on Lake Erie. Syracuse an hour and a half or so away (Go Orange!), and Toronto 3 or so hours away. There is plenty to do based on your interests. Enjoy your time here.",

        "**The Erie Isles**\n\n* System of Government: Feudal Vassal\n* Head of Government: Count, inherited in the ruling Bull family\n* Population: 3,000 permanent inhabitants\n* Religion: Nondenominational Christianity\n* Totemic Symbol: Great Lighthouse of Perry\n\nThe Erie Isles lay between Ohio and Michigan. Once, they were prime vacation destinations, sought after for their pleasant climates and fecund greenery. Today, they are sought after for a different reasons: not only are they rich in stone, lumber, and wine, they are among the most strategically vital locations in the Great Lakes. Contested by not only Ohio and Michigan, but by all of the great merchant clans of the Lakes.\n\nEarly in the Neo-Medieval Era, all of the islands fell under the \\[i\\]de jure\\[/i\\] rule of Ohio. However, as the centuries wore on, the great cities of the Lake Erie coast began to break away from formal Ohio control. In the 25th century, Sandusky (alongside Cleveland and Toledo) were considered formally independent, and it took the Erie Isles (and the great fortress of Cedar Point) with it. The isles flourished under Sanduskyite rule, becoming prime ports and some of the most important wineries in the Midwest.\n\nNothing lasts forever, though. In 2529, disputes between Sandusky and distant Chicago spiral into a full-blown League War. By war's end, Sandusky has been razed to the ground, the isles left to fend for themselves. With the League shattered, chaos reigns as local tycoons and strongmen prop themselves up. The isles become a haven for piracy in the absent of strong government.\n\nIn 2550, Michigan has subjugated the unruly burghers of western Ontario. They use this as a base to claim rich Pelee Island and tiny little Middle Island, Canada's southernmost point. From here, with approval from the new League (based out of Saulte Ste. Marie), they subdue the pirates of the Erie Isles and spin them off as a vassal states with a similar status to Western Ontario.\n\nIn the 27th century, Ohio once again begins to assert control over the cities of the Erie Coast. Instead of ruling with an iron fist, Ohio adopts a policy of benign neglect - funds are poured in to the region to develop its infrastructure, but otherwise the cities are declared Special Economic Areas that are allowed to conduct their own business. One of the most important treasures of the Erie Coast that is denied the Buckeye Throne, however, is the Erie Isles. Ohio takes the case to the Supreme Court. While the Court finds that under normal circumstances the land is Ohio's by legal right, they failed to properly administer the land whereas Michigan was administering it, making Michigan the proper warden of the territory or the duration of the Emergency. Nevertheless, Ohio launches a war for the territory which it loses. This serves as further encouragement for Ohio to better develop its naval capabilities. Minor islands would trade hands over the next few centuries, but Michigan would remain dominant.\n\nRound two occurs during the Toledo War of the 2700s, which ends indecisively with no land changing hands despite a major Ohioan victory at the Battle of Gibraltar. It seemed that Ohio's hopes of re-taking the Erie Isles were lost once and for all following the Great Midwestern War when Ohio lost Toledo and was forced to grant major concessions to the merchants of the Erie Coast. The Dabney Raids further distract Ohio, forcing them to grant even more independence to the Erie Coast merchants, and losing it control over Allegheney County.\n\nIts dreams would finally be realized during the Michigan Punitive War, however, when Michigan was roundly defeated by the allied powers, and the League would see fit to not only return Toledo to Ohio, but to grant it control over all the Erie Isles. Michigan had proved itself over the past few decade to be a far more overbearing master of merchant activities, making the restoration of Ohioan control the natural choice.\n\nThe Erie Isles were spun off as a county separate from Sandusky, granted the greatest independence of all of Ohio's Lakeish territory. Interestingly, the Erie Isles are home to several of Ohio's only remaining Masonic Lodges - when Wallace I dissolved most of the Masonic Lodges in the Commonwealth's territory, he left a few in key strategic points. One of these was the Erie Isles, for free reason: their ambiguous legal status, the several prosperous wineries and public works maintained by the Masons on the Isles, and a desire to keep the Erie Tycoons from gaining total control. Many Masons fled to the Isles following the dissolution of their order in Ohio.\u00a0\n\n**The Great Commodore's Lighthouse**\n\nThe Great Commodore's Lighthouse was originally built to commemorate the victory of Oliver Hazard Perry in the battle of Lake Erie, and to celebrate a lasting peace between the US and Canada.\n\nAs with so many other things, the meaning would get twisted in the centuries after the Regression. Sailors passing through the isles looked upon the tower in marvel - truly, the men of Old America were Gods. How could they build such a marvelous thing? Simply to commemorate a victory all the way back in 1812? This could not be.\n\nFirst, Admiral Oliver Perry became conflated with his brother, the great Commodore Perry who forced the opening of Japan. Then, this became conflated with America's War against Japan - from the infamous attack of Pearl Harbor to the 1,001 celebrated naval battles that occurred half a world away. Prime among these were the Battles of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, where it is said that blood-crazed Americans fought so hard that they reduced those cities to smoldering craters. Finally, the memorial became one to America's naval prowess in general. Even the provision for peace fell into disregard - instead, following the incorporation of Ontario into the Nondenominational Union, it came to symbolize the American conquest or Canada.\n\nThe tower sits not far from the town formerly known as Put-In-Bay, now Commodore's Bay. The greatest town in the isles, guarded by the mighty fort of Gibraltar Island. It is here (guided by the Commodore's Lighthouse) that most merchants stop.\n\nThe tower was first refurbished and made a useful lighthouse during the reign of Sandusky over the isles, and served the League well as a navigational aid. However, following the fall of the League and the razing of Sandusky, the tower fell into disuse. The pirates that held Great Bass Isle had no desire to aid the passage of ships. Instead they used the tower as a lookout point to spot approaching ships. When the interregnum was over and Michigan came into possession of Great Bass Isle, the tower still remained disused. It would only be when the Buckeyes retook Great Bass Isle alongside the rest of the Erie Isles in 2804 following the Peace of Toledo and the conclusion of the Michigan Punitive War.\n\nA great rebuilding was ordered, and the President poured money into the coffers of the local Masonic Lodge that had long maintained the lighthouse. With this cash in hand, they set about building the Commodore's Cathedral, a great building that incorporated the tower as its steeple. Not only did the lighthouse become one of the most important navigational aids in the lake, it became a great site of pilgrimage - in the summer trading season, the population of the Isles swells up to 10,000 as countless sailors come to ask the maritime Patriot-Saints for safety on their journey. Among the many relics there are the bones of Perry, a rib from Jonah's whale, a splinter from the hull of Old Ironsides, and one of the teeth of Jaws.\n\nIn 2978, a second refurbishment was ordered by President Wallace I \"The Great\" Ingram-Wolf. Not only did he expand the size of the Cathedral, he ordered an alteration to the tower to make it truly his: he ordered that inside and outside, the history of Ohio and America would be carved into the granite, beginning with Columbus's discovery of America and ending with the coronation of Wallace I. Constructions are ongoing, and it is predicted that it will be finished by the dawn of the New Millennium.\n\nAt 352 feet high, the Commodore's Lighthouse is the second building in the Americas - arguably the first if you do not consider the Washington Monument a proper building. The smoke from its fire can be seen as far away as Detroit, and its light can be seen from almost anywhere in western Lake Erie. Every day, the masons march up the winding spiral staircase carrying fuel for the fire, contemplating the sacrifice of Christ and America's role in the Creator's plan. \n\n\\--------------------------\n\nThis was created for Medieval America Mark III, an ongoing collaborative project on alternatehistory.com.",

        "[The original map I posted a few days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/pittsburgh/comments/i6rsgg/was_messing_around_with_metro_map_maker_and/)\n\n**Turns out I forgot the Hamnet stop on the East Busway between Wilkinsburg and Roslyn. Whoops!**\n\nSome of you probably saw my post a few days ago where I made a theoretical map of rapid transit expansion in Pittsburgh. The idea was to make a map with the corridors that would most realistically be utilized for mass transit/commuter rail extensions based off plans and studies done by PennDOT and PAT, with a little bit of my own input thrown into the mix. After doing a little more research and looking at feedback on my original post, I've made a revised map with a few changes here and there. Some changes are very small, such as moving around or re-naming a few stops, as well as adjusting the scale and spacing on the map to make it more legible. Some of the larger ones include:\n\n\\-Changing line colors to make things less confusing. Rather than having 5 or 6 light rail routes that all terminate downtown and branch out into the suburbs, I have 3 lines that run from the present-day T lines in the South Hills through downtown to various points north and west of the city. The Blue Line is extended up the Ohio Valley out to Moon and the airport (this was a green line on my original map), the Red Line is extended up into the North Hills, and the Silver Line makes the full run to Warrandale (this was the orange line on my first map). This was done to help make the map less confusing since there's only 3 lines that run through downtown instead of 5 or 6.\n\n\\-Extended the East Busway (aka Purple Line) out to Monroeville. This is a realistic possibility, as extending the busway has been discussed as part of the planned Mon-Fayette Expressway extension to Monroeville. I used railroad right of way most of the way, the only logistical issue is figuring out where exactly in Monroeville it will terminate.\n\n\\-Included the southern branch of the planned Oakland BRT (absent from my last map), additionally I extended it to Homestead, Kennywood, and Duquesne. Whether this would be in mixed traffic or on a new right of way I haven't figured out, but it could be doable. I'm renaming it the Orange Line.\n\n\\-Removed the extension of the South Busway due to lack of space. Would be nice to extend it further towards Brentwood, Baldwin, etc, but it's so heavily developed in that area that there isn't any place to put dedicated right-of-way. All South Busway routes continue beyond the end of it anyways, so if anything they can improve signage for the routes that run beyond the busway and add priority signaling for buses, particularly on PA 51.\n\n\\-West Busway is extended to South Fayette through Heidelberg and Bridgeville. This would be tricky because of how developed the area is, and my routing would take it along still-active railroad lines, however some of this route could implement abandoned Panhandle Railroad right-of-way and/or be built alongside the still active Pittsburgh and Ohio Central/Wheeling and Lake Erie lines to the planned terminus.\n\n\\-Removed my two proposed streetcar lines through the Strip District and South Side. I would still love for this to happen but I think it would be the least likely of my proposals to actually happen. Extending the Oakland BRT to cover Homestead, Kennywood, etc and having the Allegheny Valley commuter line serve Lawrenceville somewhat makes up for this.\n\nThe largest changes are the addition of more \"commuter rail\", which I'm dubbing \"regional rail\" as I would like it to see use beyond just suburban commuters:\n\n\\-Rerouted the Allegheny Valley rail line to stay on Allegheny Valley Railroad tracks the entire way to Arnold. This means it can't serve communities on the other side of the river like Millvale, Etna, Cheswick, etc, but it more closely follows the actual studies done by PennDOT. The AVRR tracks see less freight use than the Norfolk Southern tracks that line the north side of the river, (and we all know how much Norfolk Southern **LOVES** passenger rail....) so it would be easier to implement passenger rail on the south side of the river using AVRR tracks. It will still serve several communities though, with a station at Highland Park providing a transfer to the Oakland BRT north branch.\n\n\\-Added a station at McKees Rocks along the Ohio Valley rail line, since the light rail line on the other side of the river would be difficult to access for people there. This with the other stops line up historically with where the former Pittsburgh and Lake Erie commuter train (discontinued in 1985) stopped along its trip from Beaver Falls to Pittsburgh. As with the previous map this uses current CSX track.\n\n\\-Changed a few stops along the Latrobe rail line to match where stops are proposed along the commuter route being studied by PennDOT. Transfers to the East Busway would be available at Turtle Creek and Wilkinsburg (the latter just restored their railroad station so it would be nice to see it implemented). As with the previous map this line uses current Norfolk Southern track.\n\n\\-Biggest addition to this map is adding rail service in the Mon Valley, which many people noted was lacking in my previous map. The route is basically a restoration of the PATrain (former Baltimore and Ohio Railroad) commuter line that ran from Versailles to Pittsburgh until 1989, with the only change being the addition of a stop in Hazelwood and the last stretch of the trip to Pittsburgh being rerouted to Penn Station (since the tracks and station the original line used are now long gone). I added a branch to serve Glassport and Elizabeth, this extension was studied by PAT back when the Mon Valley line still ran but plans for it were ultimately shelved. Both branches use present-day CSX track all the way to Bloomfield, where the trains connect to Norfolk Southern track for the end of the run to Penn Station.\n\nOn my previous map many people expressed interest in more across-town routes, since often times to get from, say, Mount Lebanon to Robinson or from Highland Park to Ross Township you have to travel the whole way into downtown and transfer to another route. This map doesn't solve that issue, however the idea is these rapid transit corridors will allow some bus routes that presently run into the city to instead serve as \"feeder\" routes to the rapid lines, and/or be expanded to run around Pittsburgh to improve cross-town service without building some kind of \"beltway\" route (the right of way for that simply isn\u2019t there and it would be prohibitively expensive to construct). Most of these planned rapid transit lines would replace present-day bus routes that run the whole way into the city, allowing those buses to be used to expand/improve service elsewhere or connect different areas without going through downtown.\n\nSo what do you all think? Did I make an easier to read map with better connections or is it worse? Let me know!",

        "In this market that's not a tall order.\n\n513 homes sold in the past 28 days as per the link above.  1,200+ listings.  Average time on market is 18 days.\n\nThe [Hamilton-Burlington realtor's association](https://www.facebook.com/RAHBNews/about/?ref=page_internal) gives their membership as \"over 3000\" in the area - the 3rd largest in our province and 8th in the country.  Not sure how many are full-time realtors or not but I'd guess maybe 2/3 are, with the other 1/3 being part-timers or moonlighters who do it for a second revenue stream.  I worked with someone who was a manager at my company but got his realtor license strictly so that he could:\n\n* gain access to the internal MLS system\n* represent himself in the sale of his current home and purchase of a new one\n* Help friends with buying and selling\n* A distant second revenue stream; was not interested in doing it even part-time\n\nSo even if you say it's about 2/3 of 3000, that puts you at about 2000 realtors in the area.  If you look at Hamilton proper you're probably right about 1500 active full time realtors in the city.  That's about 1 per realtor on average.  Selling about 1/3 of all homes every 18 days or so is not so bad, so it's not unreasonable to suggest that a good realtor is able to sell one home a month.  Even halving it you land yourself with over $80K/year.  Still not good enough when the average income is just over half that?\n\nE: Now I'm digging deep.  [RAHB 2019 annual report details](https://issuu.com/rahbnews/docs/annualreport2020_nf):\n\n* 3240 members in 2019\n* 13,256 transactions conducted by RAHB members in 2019, worth $7.9B\n   * Having a hard time understanding this, as it says later in the report that there were 12,866 sales of residential properties, and the average price was $587,745, so some may be from commercial properties, or that they just sold a lot but didn't represent the buyers; could mean a ton of outside investment in the area, such as a Toronto based realtor representing someone from Toronto moving to Hamilton)\n   * The $7.9B is strictly in sales of properties which is crazy\n* 39 MLS fines against RAHB members in 2019 (down from 68 in 2018, down dramatically in \"personal info remarks\") - impossible to tell who did what and when as the [site](https://www.reco.on.ca/complaints-enforcement/regulatory-activities-decisions/recent-enforcement-decisions/) only lists by broker or sometimes company name and hides important details like the actual city inside the decision.  **Extremely scuzzy that they hide this so that  you can't see how many things happened in your area to get an idea of the prevalence of problems.  Also is driven purely by complaints received (it seems) - so how many people know this mechanism exists?  Why is it self-regulation?  Why is RECO not reviewing all transactions?**\n* 10 complaints about RAHB members; 4 were investigated by RAHB, 6 by RECO\n* Very little lobbying seems to be done in Hamilton; most is done in Burlington.  Would love to know more about that as they only hosted 2 events in Hamilton yet hosted 3 in Burlington, 1 in Halton region and 1 in Grimsby\n* They don't seem to donate a lot to the community they live in even with record prices.  $42K donated through the \"realtors care foundation\".\n* 36 realtors volunteered to help with a Habitat for Humanity build, with a whopping 135 hours and 3 build days (roughly 10 hours per person, or 3.3 hours per day) out of a base of 3200+ people (0.1% of their base helped out)\n\nSo if we do some back of envelope math:\n\n* 12,866 sales divided by 3240 members = about 4 homes per realtor per year\n* If we take that down to 2/3 are active members that puts us at 2171 realtors, or about 6 homes per year, or one every other month, which is about on target with above\n\nWe could go further here but with an area covering:\n\n* Hamilton\n* Burlington\n* Glanbrook (for some reason not considered a part of Hamilton?)\n* Grimsby\n* West Lincoln\n* Haldimand (Caledonia, DUnnville, Hagersville and other tiny places out to Lake Erie)\n\nit's impossible to know what areas drive what volume.  I think it's probably safe to say that Burlington drives higher prices while Hamilton drives volume, and that places like Haldimand county may also inflate prices due to large acreage plots costing a lot more but also sitting on the market for longer.",

        "&gt;Let's assume that both are legitimate indications of associations with ancient Hebrews. Big assumption, but still. That still wouldn't place the BoM near those locations. They could have interacted with one of the groups that disappeared into the north (Alma 63/Helaman 3), the Jaredites, or any other group led there by God that we have no record of.\n\nOkay, I keep track of stuff on both sides of the argument. I think if this kind of stuff was appearing in Maya land, it would be seen as a big deal and be touted as a definite tie. I have only quoted two things. There are many others THAT I HAVE RESEARCHED ON MY OWN. That is what is influencing my leanings toward the Hopewell people. I am not blindly spouting \"Heartlander\" talking points. When I get a \"fact\" from anyone on either side, I research it myself and save that research in my own files so I have provenance. And if I can't find information about it, I don't accept it as fact. \n\nWhere there is smoke, there is fire. The Hopewell timeline as quoted from non-LDS scholars overlaps the Book of Mormon far better than any group further south. They built huge mounds that were surrounded by ditches and topped with wooden walls and they date to the right time, such as Fort Ancient. That is straight out the Book of Mormon battles with Amalickiah and Ammoron. Defensive walls used by the Maya are usually stone, as are the more official buildings- not a fit. Yes Mayan homes were wood, but stone was preferred for almost everything else. BoM states the Nephites clearly preferred wood for \"all manner of buildings\" including temples, synagogues and houses. \n\nThe Great Black Swamp, which existed until drained in the 1800s went from Lake Erie over into Indiana, leaving a passageway between the water on the east and Lake Michigan on the west that would fit description of the narrow neck where the sea divided the land and running from sea to sea. It would have been about 90 miles wide- much better than anything south, once again. \n\nThe earthquake that occurred along the New Madrid fault (if coupled with a tornado or other storm) in 1811-12 is also identical to what the Book of Mormon people experienced in 3 Nephi 8. And guess what? I recently found a scholarly article that examined the fault and found it had previously cut loose several times- including one about the time of Christ. I have read eyewitness accounts from 1811 about places sinking, sand blowing up out of the ground and covering stuff, seams and cracks forming along the ground and land that was broken up. You can actually see some old photos of this. In some areas they couldn't light a fire because of the extremely fine dust and grit that hung in the air. \n\nMeanwhile, I have read MA findings trying to insist this was volcanic, but where does the Book of Mormon mention any heat, ash, lahars, pyroclasitc events, etc.? One writer claimed that the lightning that set Zarahemla on fire was volcanic. Hello! That occurs within the ash cloud being ejected out of the volcano, so Z would have been virtually sitting on the thing.  You say the culture of a people doesn't prove they always lived there, but the geographic stuff is right on. It isn't conclusive, but it is too good a match to just ignore. And so far, I don't see any LDS scholars looking at it.\n\nYou say \"Joseph Smith was entitled to his opinions like any man. He never  proposed any site for BoM events as being revelation. The church explicitly has no official position on BoM geography for a reason.\"\n\nDon't you think Joseph had a pretty good idea? I know the Zelph account is from John Taylor, but if correct, it is certainly revelatory in nature, not opinion.  The church has no official position, that is true,but obviously there is a Mesoamerican bias as shown by artwork. Why do you think I grew up with the MA planted in my head as truth? It was assumed because of paintings in the Book of Mormon featuring Mayan ruins and influence. And remember the diorama in the south visitor's center on Temple Square showing Mormon abridging the plates? It's gone now, but they used *Mayan* glyphs to decorate the thing and I think Mormon was wearing a jaguar skin. \n\n\"Yes, I think the Mesoamerican hypothesis has the best arguments of any current hypothesis. But those are far from conclusive.\" Doesn't that mean you do favor it, even if is is not conclusive?\n\nAnd I disagree that God wouldn't let the location of the Book of Mormon be known. Knowing where the Bible took place doesn't convince those who don't believe. It seems to me that Satan would be the one trying to stop things just because he hates the work and the book.",

        "Yeah, it\u2019s probably more inland that gets hot, also because they are far from the ocean, so there\u2019s nothing to regulate the temperature. \n\nAs for what to do in PA, there\u2019s some stuff. I assume Lake Erie is pretty cool but I\u2019ve never been. In the winter, skiing is a lot of fun, and there are plenty of mountains to do it on. You can also hike the Appalachian trail or hike really anywhere. I\u2019ve also taken a tour of a coal mine, they take you down in and around the actual inside of the mine, part of it on a minecart. Also take a tour of Gettysburg, really neat place to learn about, and an extremely decisive battle of the Civil War. \n\nOne interesting thing, and I don\u2019t know if you can go there, it\u2019s certainly not safe, but PA has Centralia, a place that has been burning underground for 50 years and will for 250 more after a coal fire. \n\nWhat would you do in Australia?",

        "Jesse elbowed his buddy *hard* in the ribs causing a deep bone bruise (for both his buddy's ribs and his own elbow).\n \n\"HEY!\" He yelled at full volume, spitting out chunks of his Wendy's Spicy Chicken Sandwich, no tomatoes, \"GET A LOAD OF THIS CHUMP!\" And then he started laughing like the one stupid hyena from The Lion King, but that laugh quickly transformed into a full-throated chortle with a dash, maybe even a big pinch, of cackle.\n \nJay, who's ribs were compressed in from that *hard* elbow drew an imaginary dotted line with his eyes following Jesse's greasy outstretched finger. He needed to cut his nails, badly, and Jay tried to bring this up early in the car on the way to the McDonald's on Fangboner Rd but Jesse just got so angry, so Nic Cage angry, that he ended up hate driving to Wendy's (which was another 6 minute drive in total silence because Jesse had absolutely obliterated his car radio earlier that month rocking out with his cock out too hard in the car (he slammed the radio with his wang and just fucking broke it to pieces (but hey, that's that rock 'n roll lifestyle ya hear about on the news))). Jay saw who Jesse was pointing at. A lonely, pathetic, sad, loser, chump, woeful, limp-weiner guy was just sitting there at the table ALONE dipping an extra flaccid frenchy fry in his vanilla Frosty. Jay shook his head. This guy must be the biggest and most depressing sack of shit in all of Ohio to be eating alone at a restaurant.\n \nJesse sloppily horfed down his Wendy's Spicy Chicken Sandwich, no tomatoes, with BBQ sauce caked onto the corners of his mouth. He shot up out of his chair like a fucking maniac, kicking the chair out behind them and shattering a small child. He pretended to roll up some sleeves he didn't have and marched over to the sad loser eating alone.\n \n\"LOOK AT ME FUCKFACE! I'M FUCKING KING OF THE WENDY'S!!\" He grabbed a fist full of Frosty out of the guy's cup and extruded it through his fingers. He was so hyped up on Spicy Chicken that he couldn't even feel the sliquid coolness of that vanilla Frosty. \"WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT, LOSER? YOU THINK YOU CAN JUST FUCKIN' EAT HERE IN MY FUCKIN' WENDY'S WITHOUT PAYING YOUR RESPECTS FIRST!\" Jesse rammed his hand into his mouth and tongue polished his high school class ring. The purple and white fake diamonds glistened with spicy saliva. Would Fremont Ross High School be proud of Jesse for his actions? Yes, absolutely they would. That's how the Little Giants fuckin' do shit. Fuck Sandusky High School. \"KISS MY RING YOU MISERABLE WRETCH!\"\n \nThat miserable wretch simply wiped his sorry face with one of those light brown napkins which he was so fond of. In fact, the only reason he went to Wendy's was to restack his stash of 'kins. He used them for everything from house cleaning to butt cleaning. A heaving, sweaty, and red-faced Jesse stood over the man. He looked Jesse in his bloodshot eyes and then over to Jay, who was now silently seething with anger in his seat.\n \n\"Doth this foul beast speaketh for thou, as well?\" the man said poetically, raising a single eyebrow, his dominant eyebrow. Jay responded by slowly raising his hand to his chest, clawing into his shirt, and ripping the fucking thing off in one clean jerk. Jay's face was unchanging in its rigid fury. That was a pretty clear \"Yes\"\n \nThe chump sighed. Was he never destined to just sit and enjoy a meal alone? Was it *that* taboo these days? \"So be it...\"\n \nThe worthless dud flopped out of his chair and plopped flat on his back. No matter how confident he ever was, eating alone in a restaurant was just never a good idea, and this time he pushed himself too far. Within moments, Jesse was on top of his tearing him apart with his too-long finger nails. He was like a wild mandrill the way he moved and screamed. And I'm talkin' this guy was really going fucking bonkers here and before you know it, Jay joined in. His savage arms were striking in new and brutal ways that had never before been recorded on camera, that is, until the Wendy's staff whipped out their last generation phones and started recording the onslaught. Well, yeah, it wasn't long before their fryers were revved up enough to join in. They started attacking the squishy body of the chump who surrendered his life to these animals.\n \nWads of hairy skin with globs of yellow fat flew through the air. Blood spurted and squirted every which way. Unidentifiable viscera and gut chunks were strewn about the floor, but the people of the restaurant, the people who would never sink so low as to actually eat alone, those people just would not stop. Gripping it and ripping it was the name of the game and that game was going into quadruple overtime. The patrons of Wendy's had formed a circle around the violence and were cheering on in unbridled joy. One of them even started giving another a hand job. Whoa!\n \nYeah, the chump was dead, and had been for at least twenty minutes now, but these unleashed freakazoids weren't letting up. They turned their sights to a chair. It was just sitting there alone. They went over and fucked the shit out of that chair (non-sexually). What was next? Oh, one Frosty machine? Making Frosty's alone?! NOT IN MY WENDY'S! They fucking tore into that poor machine without hesitation. It squished and sloshed a cry for help, but no one there could understand Frostinese. Anything in that restaurant that stood alone was totally obliterated and a few things were sexually assaulted (not that fist chair though (but a few after, yes)).\n \nThen they looked at each other and noticed that they only had one nose just sitting there all alone on their faces. Well, they took care of that. And then obviously they notice most of them had only one dick dangling all alone at the base of their well-muscled, adrenaline fueled torsos. Those were gone in a fraction of a second.\n \nThis irrational hate and brutal violence for anything not part of a pack continued well into Sandusky (fuck Sandusky High School). \"The Wendy's Loner Haters Mob\" as the newspapers called them later, was shot down and killed by the brave cops at Cedar Point. The resident priest of Cedar Point condemned all their souls to hell. We\u2019d all like to imagine that the damnation took, but I got a feeling those angry folk are still lurking around out there somewhere. It ain\u2019t called Lake Erie for nothing.",

        "This sub is pretty dead (sad), but here are some suggestions:\n\n**With a car (or bike and some determination)**\n\n* Sullivan's - A pretty good burger place a little out of town on Rt. 20.\n* Point Gratiot - A fun beach (look for beach glass, swim, make sand castles, enjoy the beachiness), a pretty good public park, and a lighthouse that has (I think) tours sometimes.\n* Dunkirk pier - Cheesy but (IMO) fun little boardwalk with a few places for treats, etc. If you like fishing, you can do it there or nearly anywhere along the water. You can walk or bike on the path along the water, too, from Point Gratiot (with some detours on sidewalks). I recommend avoiding Demitri's restaurant except their patio/bar, which is fun. The food is... not great IMO.\n* Amazing Taco Place (not its real name, which I can't remember) - On Lake Shore Drive near the marina/pier in Dunkirk. Kind of a \"hole in the wall\" place. I think they're open right now. Everything they sell is amazing. Try a couple of Tacos al Pastor. The people running this place are from Mexico and some of their salsa will burn your face off, so maybe get it on the side. I think they also now have a place in the pier shops, selling only  a few of their tacos etc.\n* Lake Erie State Park - 10 minutes by car. Beach (no swimming right now), camping (maybe reopened? IDK), nature trails, and (best part) Disc Golf. 18 holes. If you don't have a disc the station at the entrance to the park (right off Hwy 5) will sell you one. Google for a good kind. Disc golf is the best: wander around the forest throwing a disc at baskets and OK probably spend a while in the said forest looking for your disc that you threw in there. Get a bright colored one.\n\n**No car**\n\n* Canadaway Creek - In nice weather it's a great place to go wander and enjoy nature. See minnows, wade in the shallows, catch tadpoles, etc. One way to get there is to go up Temple Street from Old Main Dr., then go right on Risley, down the hill. More or less at the bottom of the hill there's a bridge across the creek and some trails going down to it. Note: Please don't spray paint anything or throw trash. Lots of families enjoy the area, too, and there are a couple of conservation efforts ongoing. A few \"college kids\" trash places like this sometimes, and it doesn't help the local view of Fredonia students.\n* Barker Square - Basically \"downtown,\" near where students who drink go to drink at bars; you can go there at non-drinking times, and for non-drinking activities, too. Walk up Temple Street until you get to the square (also called \"The Commons\" or \"Barker Commons\"). Cute little park, nice public library  on one side (and post office, handy in this day and age), a couple of shops, etc. \n* Opera House - on one side of Barker Commons. It has some town offices in it, but it also has weekend film events, usually Saturday nights. Many people in town get email updates about these, but I'm not sure how you get on the list. You can probably google and find out what's happening any given weekend. \n* Farmer's Market - Saturday mornings at Barker Commons (right in front of the Opera House). Very small but cute little market. You can get maple sugar candy or some very good fresh spring rolls like a yummy little salad served with spicy peanut sauce (if you ask for that). Also some vegetable stalls. Like I said, quite small.\n* Various festivals - Often held in Barker Commons. People set up the standard kinds of stalls selling food, homemade jewelry, etc. The schedule varies, and IDK if any are set for the rest of this season.\n* Contra dancing - In The Grange Hall (on Main St. downtown, near some of the bars). For the past few years this has happened once a month or so, but recently I haven't seen notices for it, possibly due to the pandemic. It's families and local people, mostly, but anyone wanting to try some Appalachian folk dancing with a live band would be welcome. It's kind of like square dancing crossed with Celtic music and dancing. \n\nThis is a \"bodaciously small town,\" and it has small town things to do, but sometimes they're fun. I'm not an expert, so the list above is incomplete.\n\n*Edits: things I forgot about and added later*",

        "&gt;  This just shows you don't know how  trade routes work. All of those cities are upstream of NYC. Their  prosperity would only drive further prosperity in NYC, because NYC  controls the mouth of the Hudson, through which trade would flow. Those  cities would trade with eachother yes, but the real money is in the  trade between regions, between those cities and the Caribbean, which  flows through NYC.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;You could argue  that they could sail around Gaspe rather than down the Hudson, but that  would be 1. Significantly longer 2. Sailing through more treacherous  seas and 3. Sailing through pirate infested waters and hostile occultist  ports rather than down a river controlled by peacenick Anabaptists and a  merchant republic.\n\n 1. yes they are upstream from NYC but they're both physically close and connected by more minor rivers and canals to Lake Ontario and Lake Erie. NYC is only relevant for commerce through the Atlantic and again there isn't that large an overall advantage to going through there instead of the St. Lawrence River where you could get to the open sea much more quickly and directly, avoiding the customs duties associated with all the towns across the Hudson and NY and allowing someone coming from the Great Lakes direct access to the Atlantic instead of having to sell their merchandise to intermediaries between the Great Lakes and anywhere beyond NYC\n\n2. I don't understand your obsession with NY-Caribbean trade. Again NY isn't the convenient picking up point of American merchandise for North Atlantic mercantile empires that it was in the colonial era. And likewise the main trading nodes are outside the way of NY. If someone wants to go from the Great Lakes, or Lower Canada they can just sail directly to the Caribbean instead of losing most of their profit margin selling it locally and having it hauled through a constricted and controlled trade route like the Hudson. The reverse is also true. For not alot of extra risk or cost you could sail around the Maritimes and make a decent profit undercutting NY by skipping all the Hudson and NYC customs fees which would inevitably be applied. And given the political situation why wouldn't that happen? The Hudsonians would be more than happy to fuck over americanist New York and have their major cities supplied through the less customs burdened St.Lawrence. Maybe there's some revenue loss for the Hudsonian crown from less customs fees and administrative taxes but I figure that it's reasonable that the Lake Ontario connected and facing cities in the north and west of the kingdom would be more politically influential than NY and the Hudson towns, which would be hampered by NYC's chokehold, due to greater hinterlands and more distributed locations. Also trade with the Great Lakes region and the Mississippi would also grow these cities much more than the Caribbean trade would overall grow NYC. You're underestimating how comparatively easy and how much more profitable sailing along Nova Scotia would be for trade in the region. The one who doesn't seem to understand medieval trade would be you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; And for the love of God, NYC wouldn't be the biggest city on the map  with these changes. The city itself would still be limited to Manhattan.  The modern city is pretty damn big, but most of the holdings would be  outside of New New York proper. The Merchant Republican city state would  be relatively large with this, like the Venice its intended to be. \n\n It already is with 13 holdings spread across Brooklyn and Manhattan, some of the physically smallest areas individually on the map. You then propose to add 2 more counties out of splitting Manhattan out of it's northern more rural areas, making the 7 holdings you still want Manhattan to have in this case more densely packed and urban than anything else on the map, very close to another 6 holdings in an even smaller province in Brooklyn. By it's size these provinces can't be considered anything else than very closely located cities or a conurbation. You also at the same time propose several times smaller Staten Island have it's own county and 3 or 4 holdings, having it be even more densely inhabited than Manhattan and Brooklyn and all the cities in vanilla CK2, much less the mod. yes the city or very closely (somehow) set of cities would by far be the densest urban agglomeration on the map. Don't deny it with technicalities about which counties constitute New York proper. I'm obviously talking about at least Manhattan and Brooklyn combined, and the compression of Manhattan and conjunction of extremely dense Staten Island. That entire built up area would be the NYC im talking about. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; Bullshit. That's your headcanon. Most of NYC isn't skyscrapers. Most of  Manhattan Island would be arable after 600 years, hell after less than  200. This isn't some hypothetical here, we have real cities, right now,  that saw formerly urban areas converted to arable land. You are just  dead wrong here mate, no matter how much you may want it to be  otherwise. \n\nBut a good chunk of it is. Besides it's not alot of land to feed the great medieval city it already is in the mod or the even greater city you want to turn it into. I'm also curious how much of that developed land has been converted into genuinely arable land. You haven't given any figures only the vague allusion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; Its actually mostly suburbs and golf courses you nugget. You just keep showing your ignorance. \n\nAnd you keep showing your intransigence. That wasn't the main point, the size was. You want something close to 500 or 600k people in Staten Island which you propose (even going by Constantinople as having 250 to 300 k non-disaster afflicted population which is in agreement with wikipedia's sources) on top of about 1 million in Manhattan and Brooklyn just next door. Btw no need to be rude but keep going, im sure this almost entirely cordial retort on my part will justify more rude dismissals of my abilities and fallacious accusations in your head.\n\nPart 2/2",

        " In this Lesson, learner Lilly wants to gain confidence with using the clutch in order to move off quickly in a manual car so that she doesn't keep missing opportunities to go during her lessons. Instructor Matt, talks through and shows Lilly what to do and offers some tips that helped a lot with the clutch and how it's best used in conjunction with the gas pedal. We go over why using the gas with the clutch is important and try to get to the root of why Lilly has never felt confident moving off from stationary at a junction...

        "Sorry to hear. A few months ago I was walking on a breakwall at Lake Erie and slipped and fell straight onto my brand new Tamron 70-180 which was mounted to my backpack with a Peak Design clip. Plus, I banged myself up pretty bad as well. Unfortunately things like this will happen from time to time if you are serious about photography.\n\nThe screen shouldn't be terribly expensive to replace. How old is the camera?",

        "\nBy Rich Exner, cleveland.com\nCLEVELAND, Ohio - Ohio\u2019s election results will not be official for some time, but there are some key things to watch as updates are released Tuesday night and likely going into Wednesday morning that will provide clues on how the final, official tally will end up.\n\n1. The early returns\nMost of the early vote, mailed in or conducted in person, will be among the first results released soon after polls close at 7:30 p.m. When you see a vote total with 0% of the precincts reporting, these are votes each Board of Elections had in hand by Election Day.\n\n\nHistorically, this is a pretty good indicator of how the final tally will turn out. A cleveland.com analysis of this early vote in local elections for Cuyahoga County last year found the typical swing from this first count until the end of the night was just 1.5 percentage points. For 109 of 115 head-to-head races or issues, the leader in absentee balloting remained ahead when the counting was done for the night.\n\nBut there are some caveats. Historically speaking, Republican candidates tend to do better with in-person voting (Donald Trump has been pushing that narrative). Polling indicates Republicans are more likely to vote Tuesday than Democrats, perhaps widening that gap. And the early-vote this year has been bigger than ever before.\n\nIf all this holds true in 2020, expect the Republicans to do better as the in-person voting results come in during the night.\n\n2. Big county votes from Cuyahoga, Franklin, Hamilton\nIncreasingly in recent elections, Republicans have built up wide support in the smaller counties; Democrats in the urban centers.\n\nIn Ohio\u2019s three biggest counties combined - Cuyahoga (Cleveland), Franklin (Columbus) and Hamilton (Cincinnati) - the Democratic presidential candidates carried at least 60% of the vote in each of the last three elections, including Hillary Clinton\u2019s 60.5% to 35% win over Trump in those three counties in 2016.\n\nTrump made up that 407,981-vote deficit in the three big counties by winning the combined vote in Ohio\u2019s other 85 counties by a whopping 854,822 votes, 58.5% to 36.6%.\n\nIf there are a lot of outstanding votes in the big counties as the results arrive, Republicans should be concerned. Same goes for Democrats if the small-county voting largely is not yet tabulated.\n\nConsider this: Barack Obama ran up a 256,613-vote lead in Cuyahoga over Mitt Romney in 2012, enough to provide the difference in the election. This made up for losing the rest of the state, the combined vote for the other 87 counties, by 90,343 votes.\n\nIn 2008. Obama beat John McCain by 258,542 votes in Cuyahoga County. In the other 87 counties, Obama out-polled McCain by just 3,682 votes.\n\nHere\u2019s what to look for Tuesday.\n\nIs Biden building upon the voting shares won by Clinton in these large counties - 66% in Cuyahoga, 60.4% in Franklin and 52.7% in Hamilton? Cuyahoga and Franklin were her best showings in all of Ohio.\n\n3. Will Trumbull County flip back?\nTrumbull County, which includes the city of Warren and is just north of Youngstown, gained a lot of attention for how it voted in 2016 - for good reason.\n\nTrump\u2019s win in Trumbull marked the latest tumbling of what had been a blue wall of sorts in much of Eastern Ohio.\n\nStarting with Jimmy Carter\u2019s election in 1976, six Ohio counties had reliably voted for Democratic presidential candidates each time. Those streaks ended in 2012 for three Eastern Ohio counties built on steel and coal - Jefferson, Belmont and Monroe.\n\nBut even as those Ohio River counties switched over to red, Trumbull, Mahoning and Cuyahoga stayed Democratic in 2012, each giving at least 60% of their vote to Obama.\n\nTrump then turned Trumbull four years ago, beating Clinton, 51.1% to 44.8%.\n\nIf that Trumbull margin holds Tuesday, good news for Trump. If it evaporates, Biden backers could be celebrating.\n\n\nOhio presidential election results by county, from 1972 through 2016. Darker red (Republican) and blue (Democratic) areas on the maps are counties won by at least 20 percentage points.Rich Exner, cleveland.com\n\n4. Republican strongholds\nUnlike the Electoral College, where most states are winner-take-all in presidential elections, counties can only offer trends and insights.\n\nYet, just like Democrats have done in the large counties, winning Republican candidates have been successful in building up their margins in their counties of strength.\n\nTrump received his highest shares four years ago in these five counties - Mercer (80.6%), Putnam (79.7%), Auglaize (79%), Holmes (78.9%) and Darke (78.5%).\n\nAs results come in Tuesday, it\u2019s worth checking whether his strength has built up or shrunk.\n\n5. The vote counting does not end on election night\nWarning here, in case you haven\u2019t heard already. The vote counting in Ohio, by law, does not end on election night, or even the day after.\n\nCounties have until Nov. 18 to complete their official tally, adding in provisional votes and absentee ballots mailed in time and arriving by Nov. 13, whether they were mailed domestically or under federal law from overseas-stationed military members and their families.\n\nDemocrats Clinton, Obama and John Kerry all did thousands of votes better than their Republican counterparts in post-election day counting, cleveland.com research found.\n\nTrump gained 69,021 Ohio votes between the unofficial count on the day after the election and the official count weeks later. Clinton added 77,163 votes, closing the margin by 8,142.\n\nObama widened his margin over Romney by 59,029 votes during this later counting in 2012, and by 56,911 over McCain in 2008. And in 2004, Kerry closed his gap on George W. Bush by 17,620 votes.\n\nKeep these numbers in mind if the unofficial tally is close.\n\n\nDemocrats have done better than Republican presidential candidates in Ohio for those votes added between the unofficial results near Election Day until the official count weeks later. (Note, in some cases the unofficial tallies differ slightly, depending on the time of publication.)Rich Exner, cleveland.com\n\n6. Ottawa County, Ohio\u2019s bellwether\nIf all this is too complicated, boil it all down to Ottawa County, a place more well known in non-election times as a vacation retreat for summer homes and cottages on the mainland or the Lake Erie island experience of Put-in-Bay.\n\nThe fall-time residents who make Ottawa County their voting home have gone with the winning presidential candidate in 14 straight elections, starting with Lyndon Johnson in 1964.\n\nNo other Ohio county has followed this winning trend so long.\n\nYes, Ohio has also picked the winner for the same 14 elections, by far longer than any other state.\n\nBut if the results are in early from Ottawa County, this could be an early indicator.",

        "That's some serious pepper skill, growing all that in Toronto! I'm on the other side of Lake Erie, and it's hard enough, but I'm nowhere near as cold as you are. How early do you start seeds? Do you overwinter a lot?\n\nThis is my first year in the exchange, and my packets are pretty basic. I didn't have room to add any pictures or anything. Next year I'll have to make them a bit more fancy! \n\nVery cool of you to go through the effort to make these so nice. Anyone who gets yours will be grateful, I think.",

        "Entered college in 1999 with a knack for writing reports to become a \"journalist\". Settled for the state college's \"Communications and Media Studies\" major as it was the closest thing available to the \"Broadcast Journalism\" programs of well-renowned schools across the country I was applying to but, being on my own, moving myself so far away from home wasn't something I actually knew how to do (yet). Back then of course we're learning how to write for a newspaper, maybe a magazine, with no real idea how obsolete our training would be within a few years of graduating. Along the way these classes would teach the formats to follow to compose a write-up, how to order the write-ups in each section, and how to order the sections within the publication. My growing unease over the covert methods use to hold audience interest exploded the first time I heard the phrase \"if it bleeds it leads\", and coupled with classes that clued us into the way a newscast readies the audience for the commercials they watch throughout it sent me screaming to the hills. By the time I graduated I wanted nothing to do with mass media or broadcast journalism at all. \n\nAs it turns out those hills were the rockies, and one of my first jobs as a young mom was for a marketing promotions company that taught direct impulse sales to its employees in a systematic format not unlike the all encompassing environmental controls found in a cult - fortified with the methods of subliminal advertising every step of the way. I spent 3 months learning how to impulse everyday people to empty their pockets on the spot til I had $400 to take back to the office and call it a day. A family emergency helped me demand a day off from my very reluctant boss and my fiance used the downtime to help me break away from the daily training work was reinforcing in my mind. I began new hobbies that fueled passionate research into the science of folk remedies that I eventually turned into my own herbal tea business that I built up on the local craft circuit, happy as a lark to sell 5 dollar blends to people genuinely interested in them, IF they decided FOR THEMSELVES it's something they'd like to try, AFTER fully educating them on the potential effects on their well being both wanted and detrimental and possible contradictions to their current wellness routine BEFORE they buy. It was such a good place in life to be and my knowledge and info and dedication to developing quality teas blended for actual effects I tested to the max personally and selling them honestly through well-rounded reliable info without impulsing the brain's neuron firings (well, ok, maybe a little to upsell 'em a 3rd bag for \"free\" ... old habits die hard some would say) helped my business grow to 50 custom blends as I moves from craft shows to a beautiful online set up I daydreamed would afford me a tea bar on the wine trail here back home on Lake Erie that I could hand off to my children someday. \n\nI even published my research on which folk remedies work, which ones might hurt, and WHY, using the constituents of the products cross referenced with clinical trials and toxicology info from the NIL. When I discovered companies using the impulse marketing I learned out west to push sales of herbal products in ways that could harm the user that weren't being disclosed, I gave a voice to herbalists that had been muffled by manipulative sales practices of multi level marketing companies for close to 20 years. \n\nAs you might have guessed, my success didn't last long. 10 years into running my business and the first year I finally broke even and made a profit equal to part time pay, I found myself breaking out as an indie journo in 2016 as Snowden was beginning to show us that was likely the most self-sabotaging career move ever made by anyone in the entire course of human history. Slowly but surely my network began having issues, then my devices, then my online abilities regardless of device that others using before and after didn't have... fast forward to losing my bank accounts, my card catalog searches at the library returning results all in German, uncannily untimely communication in every electronic format, the havoc that wreaks on on running a business (lost it, and the art biz my fiance ran from home, too), personal relationships (everyone - EVERYONE - beyond the walls of my house I had for family has disowned me) and my ability to even function day in an electronically driven everyday life like paying a bill, soccer sign ups, responding to voice mail, filing taxes, or finding any help at all to grab onto while I'm falling down the well I've been pushed into - particularly how it appears to others, especially those who can't see the well, or don't want to, or think just because they know you they might fall in it, too... fuck research, I can't even find my own material online because they turned my pen name into a limited-edition tea bag for a popular food-themed trinkets for kids toy line lol! Widely discussed but rarely ever found - how's that for a brilliant marketing scheme, eh? So I got stuffed into a virtual version of cyberspace you'd swear if you weren't stuck there must be the \"real\" thing, never really sure if anyone can actually access anything I'm writing, many time my device reboots before I get to post the thing. Been here 5 years and every now and then a post like yours makes me forget how impossible it has been and likely always be for me to participate and interact with society and I, still human, get impulsed into wasting a good hour or two trying to two thumb type out a reply to people like you.\n\nI think what I wanted to say was, \"you're right! reporters aren't journalists\" and point out somewhere along the way we used to be more synonymous, back when news was more about events and less entertaining.\n\nTL;DR : my troubles as an ethical indie, and why when it comes to what the media SHOULD be doing, no one's doing a damn thing\n\nsorry. thanks. reaching out is hard as hell, disrupted by spam calls and texts and unusually relevant off the cuff comments about whats online from my kids and those near me. i may never reach anyone with this, but if there's a chance I make the most of it, and sure do get it in lol... its all I can do, got nothing left to lose, and apparently i'll never stop trying",

        "Almost ten years ago I owned a black with sand interior 2001 330 CI convertible with the five speed manual transmission. Despite its rough history (and its penchant for leaving me stranded), I loved that car. About a year into ownership I ended up selling it, due to suddenly becoming a father (literally, I was told two days before my daughter was born). I had that car for a few months after she was born, but trying to get a car seat into the back (especially during Wisconsin\u2019s winters) combined with the previously mentioned penchant for leaving me stranded meant it sadly had to go.\n\nHere we are ten years later. Life is going well, and I\u2019ve had an itch for the last year or so for a \u201cnew\u201d fun vehicle to supplement the 2011 Mazda 3 (Celestial Blue Mica hatchback with the six speed manual) I\u2019ve been driving since selling the 2001 330CI. About a month ago I came across an Orient Blue Metallic 2004 330CI convertible on carsandbids.com, and I knew I had to have it. It checked all the right boxes for me: it was an E46, relatively low miles (75,000), six speed manual, and the beautiful Orient Blue Metallic with sand interior. Ten years ago (when getting the 2001 330CI serviced after another breakdown) I saw an M3 in what I\u2019m assuming was the Orient Blue, and I\u2019ve craved that color ever since (I also have a thing for blue cars, having owned four different cars with different shades of blue). \n\nI watched bidding over the week, poured over the pictures, and decided I was going to try and buy the 2004.  It looked nearly perfect. The listed flaws were practically non-existent. Miles were practically nothing.  As closing day came, I made plans to get out of work early to go home and watch auction end from the comfort of home. Sadly, work had other plans, and I got stuck in the office later than I planned. I tried making it home in time, but that wasn\u2019t going to happen, so I pulled off the road into a parking lot of a used car dealer to watch the auction end from my phone.\n\nThe night before I told my fianc\u00e9 I figured this would go for between $10,000 to 12,000. Bidding started that morning at about $7,000, and was nearing $10,000 as the clock ticked down (which was about the limit I was looking to spend). Finally, bidding it stalling, and I go to make one last bid of $10,100 before bowing out. For whatever reason, my fingers decided to stop working, and I couldn\u2019t get the numbers entered in. I\u2019m typing $1,100. I\u2019m typing who knows what.  I\u2019m panicking as I\u2019m watching the clock tick down eight\u2026 seven\u2026 six\u2026 and I finally get my bid entered in. Only I fucked up. Instead of typing $10,100, I swapped a 1 and a 0 and entered $11,000.\n\nSitting in my car, I start screaming \u201cShit. Shit! SHITTT!!!! SOMEBODY OUTBID ME! SOMEBODYOUTBIDME!!!\u201d The comments section on the site is a riot, commenting on the sudden increase. The other gentlemen who was bidding bows out. Three\u2026 two\u2026 one\u2026 I won. The car is mine. I call my fianc\u00e9, who knew it was auction end, and open with \u201cHoney, I fucked up\u2026\u201d\n\nI headed home, where I poured myself a drink, spoke with the seller (who is located near Boston, MA), and got a plan in place. The seller took pity on me, and took $500 off the purchase price. I booked airfare out to Boston from Milwaukee, and booked an overnight stop in Dunkirk, NY. Got insurance and everything in place, and a few weeks later I got up at 4:30am to catch a plane to Boston. The seller met me in Logan Airport\u2019s parking garage, we signed the paperwork, and now the hard part really began.\n\nAfter getting a fresh lobster roll for lunch, I now had an eight hour drive to my overnight stop in Dunkirk. The car gobbled up Massachusetts and New York just fine. The weather was beautiful, and I had the top down for most of the ride, putting it up only in the mountains of the Berkshires after dark. I made it to my overnight stay at a marina located on Lake Erie at 10pm, slept a few hours, then drove ten more hours through New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and finally back home to Wisconsin. I had the top down the entire ten hour drive (my face looked like the lobster roll I had for lunch the day before by the time I got home). The outside temperature was in the upper sixties for most of the drive, save for in the morning, where it was about 44 degrees along the lake.\n\nAll in all, I drove 1,145 miles in those two days, over about 18 hours. This was a bucket list experience for me. While I didn\u2019t take my time to stop and sight see, I had a blast. The car performed admirably. While cosmetically the car was a little rougher in person than depicted in the listing (we won\u2019t get into that here), the engine was super smooth, the transmission was tight and precise, and there weren\u2019t any hiccups, glitches, or problems performance-wise during the entire drive. Sadly, the car is already in storage for the winter, but this gives me time to fix and clean up a few things to be ready for next spring. I can\u2019t wait.",

        "With Port Authority, PennDOT, and the Southwestern PA Commission all doing public feedback/comments on the future of transportation in the region and making plans for potential expansions (that will likely not happen because God Forbid we fund transit but I digress), I decided to bring back the hypothetical map I was working on a few months ago to make some changes, improvements, and expansions further out of the city. Of course, unless a MASSIVE change in the state's transportation funding happens and/or Americans change their attitude towards public transit, I'm doubtful any of this would actually be implemented or constructed, but a man can dream! Here's an overview explaining the expansions over the existing network, changes I've made, and other notes.\n\nFor those of you who didn't see my previous hypothetical maps, I have basically taken the existing rapid transit system (the T light rail lines and the 3 busways) and have extended them along existing corridors to cover a wider area. I have also added several regional trains that would make use of mostly existing railroad infrastructure. The majority of the expansions shown are based off existing studies that have been performed by Port Authority, PennDOT, or other entities, just to keep things as realistic and practical as possible. The major expansions over the existing rapid transit network are as follows:\n\n# Light Rail\n\nAll 3 existing light rail lines are extended north and west of the city. The Blue Line continues past the existing Allegheny station and follows the existing Norfolk Southern right-of-way up the Ohio  River Valley, serving numerous areas along that corridor before crossing the river near Sewickley, and following University Boulevard through Moon before terminating at Pittsburgh International Airport. Port Authority has studied an alignment similar to this as well as an alignment following I-376, however I personally think the river alignment would serve more people and be far more useful for transporting everyone around the region, as opposed to the Parkway alignment which is basically useless to anybody not going to the airport. The only change I've made to this since my previous map was adding a stop near Coraopolis, for a potential transfer to the Beaver regional train.\n\nThe Red and Silver Lines branch off after North Side, following the existing I-279 HOV lanes to serve various neighborhoods and suburbs in the North Hills. The Red Line splits off at McKnight Road and follows it up through Ross and Wexford, while the Silver Line stays on the HOV alignment past West View and Franklin Park, before the two meet back up again in Warrendale. Presumably a new rail center for additional vehicles would be stored here or near the airport. Taking some feedback from my previous map, I adjusted a few stops along these lines and extended the Red Line to Warrendale, it had previously ended near McCandless on my last map.\n\nAdditional light rail changes include restoration of Drake, Allentown, and Penn Station service (this is virtually unchanged from my previous revisions), and acknowledging Port Authority's recent restoration of full-time Red Line service to South Hills Village.\n\n# Bus Rapid Transit\n\nThe Bus Rapid Transit lines are for the most part the same as my previous map - the busways are color coded now (West Busway is the Green Line, East Busway is the Purple Line, and the South Busway is the Yellow Line). I have adapted the planned Oakland BRT into my map, as it seems Port Authority is pretty hell-bent on constructing that. Currently express North Hills buses get the \"orange\" designation on system maps, however with the Silver and Red Lines taking its place in my system I've moved the \"orange\" name to the Oakland BRT. The East Busway is extended to Monroeville as has been discussed, following Norfolk Southern and Union Railroad right-of-way.\n\nThe West Busway is extended past its current end in Carnegie (however I have made it a small branch off the mainline for alignment reasons), and it follows existing Pittsburgh and Ohio Central Railroad right-of-way through Heidelberg, Kirwan Heights, and Bridgeville, before using abandoned railroad right-of-way under PA 50 and I-79 to reach a terminus and transit-oriented development in South Fayette. Would be a good use of the space as those empty lots off of I-79 are slated to be developed. No changes are made to the South Busway other than the name change. I've somewhat revised the Oakland BRT from Port Authority's official plans by removing some stops so it can be, you know, RAPID transit and not a glorified bus route. As before, it splits to head to Highland Park and Greenfield (as Port Authority has planned), and I extended the south branch beyond there to serve Homestead, Kennywood, and Duquesne.\n\n# Regional Rail\n\nThe largest change is the addition of more regional rail routes, extending to areas further out of Pittsburgh (and outside of Allegheny County). One route I already have planned is a restoration of the PATrain (Mon Valley commuter) service from Versailles to downtown that was discontinued in 1989. It uses CSX tracks to Oakland and finishes the run to Penn Station on Norfolk Southern track. Additionally, I proposed a branch of the Mon Valley line to Elizabeth, which Port Authority had proposed back in the 1980's before the decision was made to cut the PATrain. In this revised map I have extended both lines further, into Westmoreland County. The Elizabeth branch now runs to Monessen (this is based off a preliminary study PennDOT has done for a mid-Mon Valley commuter rail service terminating there, according to the 2020 Pennsylvania State Rail Plan, Appendix C), and the Versailles branch has been extended to West Newton.\n\nAs was on my previous map, and based off numerous studies by PennDOT, I have introduced rail service east to Latrobe (via the Norfolk Southern Pittsburgh Line), and northeast to Arnold (via the Allegheny Valley Railroad). These two routes are the most likely to see service, as more effort has been put into the feasibility studies for these two routes than any other proposed regional rail service. Service on the Allegheny Valley railroad is feasible since freight trains on the line generally only run at night, making for less logistical issues with passenger trains running on the line during the day. Substantial work would need to be done and a connection would need to be made to Penn Station, but I think this project is very much doable. As for the Latrobe service, while a lot of work has been put into studying the potential for commuter service and I think there is reasonable public interest in a commuter line, ANY passenger rail improvements on the Pittsburgh Line are always at the mercy of Norfolk Southern, as the line is a heavily busy freight route. Some traffic could be alleviated by rerouting freight trains to NS's Monongahela Line or the Conemaugh Line, but Norfolk Southern has repeatedly shown little interest in increased passenger service on its tracks. Maybe it's time to eminent domain the Pittsburgh Line...\n\nThe other proposed regional rail line that was on my previous map runs on CSX tracks along the Ohio River from Station Square to Beaver Falls, restoring the commuter train that was operated by the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad until 1985. The only change I've made to it is the addition of a stop northwest of Coraopolis to provide transfers with the Blue Line.\n\nI've added three new regional rail routes to this map, which are all unlikely to ever be introduced for a number of reasons. That being said, they would help bridge some transportation gaps in the region particularly north of the city, so I figured it was worthwhile to include them.\n\n2 routes run from Penn Station to the northern side of the Allegheny River (new track would need to be constructed to connect to the other side of the river), where they run along Norfolk Southern tracks before splitting at Etna. The eastern branch follows the Norfolk Southern tracks along the Allegheny River valley to Freeport. Taking suggestion from someone who commented on my previous map, the western branch follows the Buffalo and Pittsburgh Railroad line along PA 8 to Butler County, terminating in Zelienople. I believe a Pennsylvania Railroad commuter train followed this route until they pulled all of their commuter routes in the 1960's. I can't find any solid plans for a route in this corridor, but the 2040 Transportation and Development Plan for Southwestern Pennsylvania mentions discussion of a commuter rail line to Butler County that I imagine would use this route. Nowhere could I find a study for a line to Freeport, but who knows!\n\nThe other new regional rail route I introduced uses the Pittsburgh and Ohio Central Railroad right-of-way to provide passenger rail service from Washington and other communities along the I-79/Chartiers Valley corridor to Station Square. This is another route that formerly saw commuter services operated by the Pennsylvania Railroad, and while there are no plans or studies that I know of that would use this route for passenger service, there have been a few excursion trains that have run on the line over the years, so it is certainly possible if enough demand and resources were there.",

        "I\u2019m speaking of the events leading to the Great Peace of Montr\u00e9al in 1701, namely the Beaver wars, which was an extension of the Wendat and Haudenosaunee conflict that dates to the mid 1300s which aligned all tribes in the Great Lakes to either the Wendat or Haudenosaunee confederacy. \n\nThe wendat (Huron) were annihilated off the face of the earth by the Mohawk in 1649 when they launched several massive raids deep into Wendake, burning to the ground all wendat settlements, including at Ste. Marie, where they kidnapped the women and children while forcing the men into slavery or death. \n\nMohawk war custom was total annihilation through literal genocide and the assimilation of women and children into greater haudenosaunee culture. If you ever tour the Georgian Bay Area of Ontario, formerly Wendake, Tionontati and Neutral lands, you can literally trace the path of war the Mohawk took by visiting sites of village burnings. Ste. Marie has been reconstructed as a living history museum. I live in Ontario so I have been to these places many times. \n\nThe Mohawk pursued the Wendat and the French mercilessly until they had absolutely zero semblance of their confederacy remaining and the French were driven from what is now Ontario. \n\nThe Shawnee, fox, wenro, Abenaki, Algonquin, wendat, tionontati, Erie, Miami, Delaware among others were systematically erased by the haudenosaunee after disposing of their greatest rival, the Wendat, whom that had been enemies of since the 1300s. \n\nThe Jesuit priests who lived among the Wendat were found by the Mohawks one by one and were tortured, brutalized and killed, Jean de Brebuf was tortured, flayed alive and boiled to death before Mohawk warriors ate his heart to gain his courage, which impressed them as he did not seem to suffer from his torture. \n\nRitualistic cannibalism is part of Haudenosaunee, in particular, Mohawk culture, going far beyond european contact. \n\nThese tribes do not exist anymore. The haudenosaunee strategically eliminated each tribe in the area. \n\nThere is a reason why the Eastern US and Canada does not have large indigenous populations- haudenosaunee genocide. \n\nBy the time large scale european settlement of the Great Lakes began, the area was largely depopulated essentially opening the way for settlement with little resistance. \n\nWith small pockets of indigenous tribes, a mere shadow of Wendake- which was the largest civilization  of the Eastern Woodlands. \n\nFor years the Haudenosaunee and allies were the only people traversing ancestral paths on the north shores of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, the haudenosaunee even establishing short lived settlements At Baby Point, in Toronto, for example. Interesting tidbit- the residents of baby point continue to find artifacts to this day while doing yard work. \n\nBy the great peace of Montr\u00e9al, the haudenosaunee had depopulated the Great Lakes region so that it was largely uninhabited  and was used largely as haudenosaunee hunting grounds. \n\nAfter repeated attacks on isolated farms and towns in Qu\u00e9bec, including the Lachine Massacre, where the settlement was burned to the ground, and all 250 men, women and children were killed or assimilated. \n\nLouis sent Marine regiments to fortify Qu\u00e9bec establishing a chain of forts from Qu\u00e9bec south to Vermont, on what was the Haudenosaunee\u2019s preferred invasion route- the Richelieu River. The French established Forts along to shores of Lake Ontario in attempts to check Haudenosaunee expansion.  \n\nThreatened by French military presence and French raids into Haudenosaunee homelands , the Haudenosaunee agreed to an uneasy truce with the French in 1701 at the great peace of Montr\u00e9al. \n\nThe Haudenosaunee lost at their own game, a game they started. yet, the continued to fight and today they are 150,000 strong- the largest number of Haudenosaunee in any period. The Haudenosaunee continued to be heavily involved in diplomacy , dealing with the Dutch and English as well as the French. The Haudenosaunee Confederacy and their policies  was also used as a basis for the constitution of the US and the establishment of the United States.",

        "It\u2019s a bit difficult to sort out! The native nations that live in Ontario now aren\u2019t always the ones who lived here before European colonization, and the ones that lived there at the time now often live somewhere else. \n\nPre-contact (and pre-colonization), all of southern and southwestern Ontario was inhabited by people speaking Iroquoian languages. There were probably Iroquoian-speakers in southeastern Ontario too, as far as modern day Ottawa, and in southwestern Quebec around Montreal. To the north, basically the northern part of the Ottawa River, north of the Nipissing River, the north shores of Lake Huron and Superior, and most of southern Quebec, the land was inhabited by Algonquian-speaking peoples. \n\nAlgonquian and Iroquoian languages are totally separate language families and not at all mutually intelligible. They did learn each others\u2019 languages sometimes, and they had plenty of contract through trade and warfare, but Iroquoian-speakers tended to think Algonguian-speakers were culturally very mysterious. Algonquian peoples included the Algonquin, Innu (not the Inuit, who are again a completely different cultural/linguistic group), Odawa, Ojibwe, and Cree, among many others. The Algonquian-speaking peoples who live in Ontario today typically call themselves Anishinaabe.\n\nIroquoian speakers lived along the St. Lawrence in Ontario, between Georgian Bay and the north shore of Lake Ontario, and between Lake Huron and Lake Erie, as well as to the south of the St. Lawrence and Lake Ontario, around the Finger Lakes in what is now upstate New York. That was probably the Iroquoian homeland and they expanded north of the river/lake afterwards, but pre-Contact. When the French arrived in the 16th century, they found Algonquian peoples in Quebec, but the inhabitants of Stadacona and Hochelaga in the Montreal area were probably Iroquoians. Du to disease, warfare, or maybe just migration, the Iroquoians had disappeared from that area when the French returned in the 17th century.\n\nIroquoian languages are named after the Iroquois, or Haudenosaunee, who were a confederacy of five Iroquoian-speaking peoples, the Mohawk (Kanien\u2019keh\u00e1:ka), Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca. The five nations had joined together sometime before contact, but it\u2019s not totally clear when - maybe a couple of hundred years earlier, or maybe up to 500 years earlier. (The Tuscarora joined as the sixth nation, but much later in the 18th century.)\n\nSome of the five nations lived or traded north of Lake Ontario. The name \u201cToronto\u201d might come from a Mohawk word, tkaronto, originally referring to the narrow channel a bit further north between Lake Simcoe and Lake Couchiching where Orillia is today. \n\nOtherwise, the Iroquoian-speakers in what is now southern and southwestern Ontario were not part of the five nations, and were in fact usually at war with the five nations, despite speaking a related language. The French called them Hurons but they called themselves Wendat. The main territory inhabited by the Wendat was at the southern tip of Georgian Bay. Elsewhere in southwestern Ontario there were other groups of Wendat - the Petun, as well as the Attawandaron or \u201cNeutrals\u201d, so called because they preferred to stay out of the Wendat-Iroquois conflict.\n\nThe French and other European settlers far to the east on the Atlantic coast really only wanted one thing from the natives - furs, especially beaver pelts. The Wendat around Georgian Bay profited from the fur trade but it also pretty much wiped out the beaver population. In the \u201cBeaver Wars\u201d the Wendat were allied with the French against the Iroquois (and to some extent against the other Wendat). The Iroquois felt threatened because the Wendat now had access to European metal and other goods that the Iroquois didn\u2019t, so Iroquois attacks actually increased after French contact. \n\nFrench Jesuit priests also lived among the Wendat and tried to convert them (you may be familiar with Ste-Marie-among-the-Hurons, near Midland). But they also brought diseases, so the combination of Christianization and disease ended up massively destabilizing Wendat society. \n\nEventually the Iroquois destroyed the Wendat communities around Georgian Bay. Some of the Wendat either joined the Iroquois, or joined the Petun and Neutrals in southwestern Ontario, but the Iroquois drove them from there as well. By around 1660, there were actually no permanent settlements in southern Ontario at all. The Iroquois hunted there and traded with the Algonquian peoples to the north but otherwise the area was depopulated.\n\nIn the 18th century the British conquered New France and started settling in French territories. Following the American Revolution and the War of 1812, several native nations had allied with the British against the Americans, and the British began resettling their allies in the otherwise empty territory in southern Ontario. This is why there is a mixture of Iroquoian and Algonquian languages among the native nations that currently live in southern Ontario. \n\nThe Mississaugas of the Credit, Chippewas of the Thames, and Chippewas of Kettle and Stoney Point, for example, are Algonquian-speaking nations who were resettled in Ontario in the 18th and 19th centuries. Other Algonquian-speakers were resettled from further away - the Lenape from Delaware, who speak the Algonquian Munsee language, now live in southwestern Ontario. \n\nBut the Six Nations of the Grand River are Haudenosaunee resettled from upstate New York on the \u201cHaldimand Tract\u201d in southern Ontario - you may be familiar with the recent \u201c1492 Land Back Lane\u201d protests against housing developments on the Haldimand Tract. \n\nThere are still some Wendat communities in Ontario, but they were mostly resettled too, in Michigan and as far south as Kansas and Oklahoma.\n\nAs you can tell from my flair this is certainly the wrong part of the world and the wrong time period for me, but I live in southern Ontario too, so this is something I\u2019ve always been interested in (I was actually planning on studying this in grad school before I switched to medieval history). My elementary school was named after one of the Jesuit missionaries to the Wendat and we even went on a school trip to Ste-Marie. Here in London we have the Museum of Ontario Archaeology, which is a pre-contact Attawandaron village, and a bit further west there is a memorial to Tecumseh, the Shawnee (Algonquian-speaking) ally of the British who was killed at the Battle of the Thames in 1813.\n\nSo, in short, pre-Contact in the 16th aand 17th centuries, southern Ontario was inhabited by the Wendat and Haudenosaunee, who spoke Iroquoian languages, but they interacted with nearby speakers of the separate Algonquian language family. Post-Contact in the 18th and 19th centuries, several Iroquoian and Algonquian-speaking nations were resettled in Ontario.\n\nSources:\n\nBruce G.

        "Ok, I must admit the reading your comment was a bit weird but for a reason other than the strangeness you mentioned.  Please bear with me as I\u2019m not the best at expressing myself.  I will try to make it as clear as I can.  Anyways, yesterday there was a Missing 411 post by someone who was mentioning granite and it\u2019s association with the Missing 411 phenomena.  I got his notification on my phone and noticed in banner that went across my screen the title of his post had the word \u201cGranite.\u201d  Well, just minutes prior to that happening, I began watching a Missing 411 YouTube video.  In that video, David Paulides began to mention granite as well.  When he (David Paulides) mentioned granite, I had to pause the video to look at my phone because the timing of the two events literally happened minutes apart.  The strangest part was that despite me not being a member of the Missing 411 group on Reddit, I somehow got the notification. During the time video was paused, I went to the notification to open Reddit and leave a post about the experience.  That wouldn\u2019t have been so strange if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that I am also fascinated by synchronicity.  So getting a notification by a group that I wasn\u2019t yet a member who just happened to be discussing \u201cgranite\u201d when I had just turned on a video discussing granite, was a synchronicity event for me.  Hopefully you can click on my name and see my comments or posts so that you can see I\u2019m not making this up.  Fast forward to last night when I was watching another video and happened to notice a comment mentioning \u201cpredator.\u201d    I found that strange because in the past week I\u2019ve seen two other people mention this predator looking creature when I\u2019ve never even heard of it being a thing.  I too had an experience but never told anyone except maybe a friend and possibly my parents.  Now suddenly all these people seem to be coming out of the woodwork with these sightings.  And until this week, I thought I was the only person.  I decided to post a comment last night on the YouTube video essentially stating that.  That was 18 hours ago and this is what I posted...\n\n\u201cWhat is it with these Predator looking things people see lately?  I too had a similar incident 2 or 3 years ago, before I had even heard about this type of phenomenon or whatever you want to call it.  My girlfriend and I were driving late at night and were passing through a state forest when it appeared as if this translucent looking thing ran across the road at a high rate of speed.  It was no more than 20 yards in front of us when it crossed the road and passed through our headlights.  It took me about 15-20 seconds to say something to my girlfriend because I wasn\u2019t sure if I really saw something or what I saw.  When I did say something, I asked her if something had just run across the road about 15 seconds back.  She kind of seemed thrown off by me asking her because her response was along the lines of that she thought something did but couldn\u2019t really see what it was or anything.  She said she didn\u2019t want to say anything because she figured it was her eyes playing tricks on her.  I told her they weren\u2019t because I saw \u201cit\u201d as well.  After feeling baffled for a bit, I mentioned to her how it looked almost like something invisible.  I really didn\u2019t want to say that out of fear she would think I was crazy.  Luckily she saw it too and agreed.  I mentioned to her how it looked like or reminded me of the Predator from the movies when it was cloaked.  I wasn\u2019t even really into paranormal type things at the time.  Strangest fricken thing ever.  You\u2019re only the 2nd time I\u2019ve heard or seen someone else mention it and both time were this week even if you posted your comment 4 months ago.  I just watched this video and saw your comment.  My intention for even coming the the comment section was to see if anyone had named the Episcopal Dioceses name that was found in the praying position.  Btw, I live in Ohio near Lake Erie.  That\u2019s where my incident happened.  I\u2019m about 2 hours or so north of Wright Patterson.  I too have never told anyone except maybe my parents and one friend.  I felt too stupid and assumed people would think I was crazy.  This is the first I\u2019ve ever posted about it.\u201d\n\nSo now here we are today and I see a post about a third person in a week discussing a predator like creature and less than 24 hours of me discussing synchronicity on a different Missing 411 post.  Hope you were all able to follow that.  I took a screenshot of my post on YouTube and hopefully I can post it here with this comment so you can see how I\u2019m viewing this as another strange synchronicity event less than 24 hours from the last.  Anyways, thanks for listening and want to mention that I too am a former Marine.\n\nOk, I can\u2019t figure out how to upload my screenshot",

I would pack up my boxes and the ones that I had to come back for would be all moved around or things would be taken out of them. He would take my shit and hide it just to spite me, yeah he was a dick too! Apparently I attract crazies and don\u2019t realize it until it\u2019s too late.. so sick of it lol anyway one of the boxes that got \u201chidden\u201d on me had two humongous photo albums with all of my photos from probably 13 through 24 and all of my pictures of my puppies when I had a litter about 10 years ago with my one dog. So pissed about that!! Not just pictures either lots of other shit went missing and what pisses me off the most is that I let him keep half of my things like my vegetable steamer and my standing mixing bowl etc. if I would have known that he was doing that he wouldn\u2019t have kept anything of mine!! I\u2019m not gonna get into it lol I\u2019ll end up writing an entire series because he was such an asshat!!\n\nANYWAYS lol\n\nThe reason people aren\u2019t idiots about drinking over there is because people are introduced to it so young! It\u2019s such a no-no for underage drinking when you\u2019re a kid here.. you know forbidden fruit and all? When I was a kid we drank wine with dinner when I was about 13 and yeah when I was maybe 18 or 19 yea i partied quite a bit but I got over it pretty quick because I had grown up with it, I was over it by the time I was 20 lol It\u2019s absolutely ridiculous! You make one mistake when you\u2019re 21 years old and you have to pay for it for the rest of your life?! I wonder how they punish their own citizens who drink and drive.. I would have to look into it I\u2019m not sure if you can appeal. My do you why was only a misdemeanor and I\u2019ve heard one of two things; that if it wasn\u2019t a felony you\u2019re OK and if you\u2019ve had any kind of alcohol related offense you\u2019re not OK so I would have to call or write to the Canadian embassy and ask the proper channels\n\nI love flying, I love the way airports smell and the way that airplanes smell and the way hotels smell lol maybe I\u2019m just weird\ud83d\ude06 I haven\u2019t tried flying anywhere recently, I wouldn\u2019t want to be trapped in a pressurized cabin with all of those people and you have no idea if somebody has had Covid or not! They should implement testing if you want to travel, that you have to have a recent test done to show that you haven\u2019t had the virus and if you had the virus you would just have to get grouped with other people who have also had the virus. I don\u2019t know how else it would be safe to fly!\n\nReally? Ha that\u2019s funny I didn\u2019t know that ppl said pop anywhere other than Buffalo and Rochester lol especially anywhere in Europe! Maybe we are trendsetters LOL maybe we are turning the rest of the world onto the word pop\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\n\nMaybe it\u2019s just because when you live in America you don\u2019t hear accents very often unless it\u2019s a southern accent but I love hearing British, Scottish or Irish accents lol it\u2019s very musical to the ear\ud83d\ude0a\n\nlol What looked odd to you around Lake Erie? Well you have a new friend in Buffalo so\ud83d\ude01\n\nMark Twain was a smart man LOL smart and weird just like all of the best people are, I know he was a big alcoholic but didn\u2019t he marry his first cousin too? Jerry lee Lewis did and got absolutely and completely shunned for it!! They were so intolerant back in the 50s and completely prude (Not advocating marrying your first cousin lol) they wouldn\u2019t even show commercials about tampons\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06 even that was too risk\u00e8 for them back then lol i can just imagine watching somebody from the 50s watching TV from today lol Their faces would turn completely bright red\ud83d\ude43lol\n\nMost civil servants are not paid what they should be, people out there who are doing the most influential jobs or the most dangerous jobs get paid crap, I don\u2019t know how they live on it let alone support a family! Maybe if prices of every day goods weren\u2019t so high these days, it\u2019s crazy! Just in the last 5 to 7 years rent has gone up from about $350 a month to about $900 a month now!!! And a gallon of milk is almost $3!!! In 1920 a gallon of milk was $.66 lol fun fact for the day\ud83d\ude43 I hope for their sake that someday people realize that they deserve to be paid better for their services, I mean teachers are literally shaping the minds of the people who are going to be in charge when we\u2019re old so why shouldn\u2019t they be paid fairly?!\n\nWhen you\u2019ve never been somewhere before media images tend to pop in your head when you think of somewhere (over the rainbow lol) but once you\u2019ve been there and know people who live there obviously your perceptions of that place are going to change.\ud83d\ude0a\n\nEvery time I reply to you I first write my reply in the stupid box on the bottom I always forget to hit the reply button lol I always have to copy text and then delete my comment and then actually reply to you\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06",

        "Thank you for you for your assumptions. \n\n\n&gt; Nuclear: About 330,000 birds, by Sovacool\u2019s calculations.\n\nhttps://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/2014/08/22/pecking-order-energys-toll-on-birds\n\nFrom the paper abstract cited by U.S. News:\n\n&gt; Based on operating performance in the United States and Europe, the paper then offers a preliminary calculation of the number of birds killed per kilowatt-hour kWh generated for wind electricity, fossil fuel, and nuclear power systems. The study estimates that wind farms and nuclear power stations are responsible each for between 0.3 and 0.4 fatalities per gigawatt-hour (GWh) of electricity while fossil fueled power stations are responsible for about 5.2 fatalities per GWh. Within the uncertainties of the data used, the estimate means that wind farms killed approximately 20,000 birds in the United States in 2009 but **nuclear plants killed about 330,000** and fossil fueled power plants more than 14 million. \n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0960148112000857\n\nEdit: furthermore, I found a source offering the actual paper:\n\n&gt; The threat to avian wildlife from nuclear power plants can also be divided into upstream and downstream fatalities.\n&gt;Uranium milling and mining can poison and kill hundreds of birds per facility per year. Indeed, in early 2008 the Cotter Corpo- ration was fined $40,000 for the death of 40 geese and ducks at the Ca\u00f1on City Uranium Mill in Colorado. The birds apparently ingested contaminated water at one of the settling ponds at the uranium mine [1]. &gt;These deaths can be very roughly quantified into 0.006 deaths per GWh. &gt;The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service [31] has also noted that abandoned open pit uranium mines in Wyoming can form pit lakes hazardous to wildlife. Uranium-bearing formations are usually associated with strata containing high concentrations of selenium. It is not uncommon for these pits to kill 300 birds per year. Because those mines operated at about one-tenth the efficiency of Canon City, they would correlate to about 0.45 deaths per GWh. &gt;Taking the mean from both uranium mines gets us 0.228 fatalities per GWh.\n&gt;Like fossil fueled power stations and wind farms, avian fauna can also collide with nuclear power plants. Three thousand birds died in two successive nights in 1982 from collisions with smoke- stacks and cooling towers at Florida Power Corporation\u2019s Crystal River Generating Facility [1]. Given that the power plant now hosts an 838 MW nuclear reactor, and presuming it operated with a capacity factor of 90% and that the 3000 deaths were the only ones throughout the year, the facility was responsible for 0.454 avian deaths per GWh. Ornithologists observed 274 fatal bird collisions with an elevated cooling tower at the Limerick nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania from 1979 to 1980 [32]. Since the Limerick plant has a 1200 MW reactor, and also assuming it oper- ated at a 90% capacity factor, it was responsible for 0.261 deaths per GWh. At the Susquehanna plant in eastern Pennsylvania, 1500 dead birds were collected between 1978 and 1986 for an average of 187 fatalities per year [33]. Assuming that the 2200 MW plant operated at 90% capacity factor, it was responsible for 0.01 deaths per GWh. &gt;Extensive surveys for dead birds were also conducted at the Davis-Bess nuclear plant near Lake Erie in Northern Ohio. Orni- thologists recorded a total of 1554 bird fatalities or an average of 196 per year from 1972 to 1979 [33]. Given that the power plant hosts an 873 MW reactor, and assuming it operated with a 90% capacity factor, and the plant was responsible for 0.0285 fatalities per GWh. Taking the mean for each of the four power plants results in 0.188 deaths per GWh.\n&gt;The total avian deaths per GWh for nuclear power plants are therefore about 0.416.\n\nSource to read the paper:  https://www.bund-nrw.de/fileadmin/nrw/dokumente/Naturschutz/Vogelschlag/Literatur/Sovacool_2009_-_Avian_benefits_of_wind_energy.pdf",

But when a fluke accident changes the stakes for the entire U.S. team, Aaron sees his chance.\n&gt;\n&gt;Zack Kelly used to be a war reporter. But a successful book about his time covering global conflicts, an unsuccessful marriage, and a dose of PTSD have sidelined him from the journalism game. When an old friend calls up him with a long-form assignment about competitive figure skating, Zack has no idea what he's getting into. He also doesn't care -- it's a change of scenery and a paycheck.\n&gt;\n&gt;Thrown together under circumstances neither of them are initially enthused about, Aaron and Zack ultimately embark on an unlikely -- and ill-advised -- romance about trust, myth, and what it really means to be comfortable in your own skin.\n&gt;\n&gt;\u2014\u2014\n&gt;Ink and Ice is part of the same series as After the Gold.

        "\u201cHey Sean,\u201d I said, greeting my brother at his house. He had one arm in his coat sleeve but Marie stood behind him, helping with the other. \u201cYou guys are leaving now?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, we\u2019re already late for our reservation. Sorry to greet and go. Nathaniel is in the dining room finishing his homework. Uncle Joe is here!\u201d he shouted down the hall. \u201cListen, he\u2019s kinda had a rough day. Some of the older kids were talking and he *might have* heard that there\u2019s no such thing as Santa Claus. Little fuckers. I think I got him believing again, so if he brings it up, can you just play along?\u201d\n\nHis wife pushed him out the door as he handed me a set of keys. \u201cDon\u2019t let him stay up too late, Joe. He\u2019s got school tomorrow.\u201d\n\nFrom his minivan, Sean waved goodbye. \u201cThanks again, little brother!\u201d The tires practically squealed as they hastily drove off. \n\nI found my eight-year-old nephew at a large oak table, papers and worksheets fanned out in front of him. \u201cHow\u2019s it going, Nathaniel? Whatcha working on? Need help on anything?\u201d\n\nHe looked up and I saw circles under his eyes. \u201cAre they gone? Did Mom and Dad leave?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, they just left. Hey little dude, are you okay?\u201d I knelt at his side and noticed his hand, gripping a pencil under the table like he was expecting a bad deal to go south. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d \n\n\u201cI need your help, Uncle Joe. Somebody killed Santa Claus and I need you to help me catch them.\u201d\n\n\u201cUm, what?\u201d\n\n\u201cSanta Claus. You know, Kris Kringle? The jolly old Saint Nick? He\u2019s dead, Uncle Joe. I heard it on the playground. It was a hit, and no one is doing anything. Mrs. Engel says we have to always do what\u2019s right, and that\u2019s why we have to catch the villains.\u201d\n\n*Jesus, what did he mishear?* I thought. \u201cHow can you be sure? Christmas is still three months away and he\u2019s probably up at the North Pole, finishing his toys.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what Daddy said!\u201d he screamed, pushing homework off the table. \u201cHe thinks Santa\u2019s okay but I know... I **know** that Santa isn\u2019t at the North Pole. He\u2019s at the bottom of Lake Erie with his feet tied to a cinder block. Big Kyle even showed me where on his phone.\u201d\n\n\u201cBig Kyle? What is he, a grade school mobster?\u201d\n\nThe child looked at me like I was an idiot. \u201cNo, we call Kyle Effenbacher Big Kyle because he\u2019s in sixth grade, and Kyle Henricks Little Kyle because he\u2019s in third. Sheesh, Little Kyle doesn\u2019t even have *have* a phone.\u201d He shook his head and unfolded a sheet of paper. In big, sloppy letters was written, **CASE OF DEAD SANTA**. \n\nI thought about my brother\u2019s advice. I didn\u2019t want to shake either of their beliefs: that Santa was the victim of holiday homicide, and that I was responsible enough to babysit. \u201cOkay Nathaniel, I believe you. Santa\u2019s swimming with the fishes. Do you have any leads?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, but I know where we can get some.\u201d He opened his mouth and pointed to his upper canines. \u201cI need you to knock out a tooth so I can talk to the tooth fairy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u203d Are you crazy? I\u2019m not going to punch a kid in the fucking mouth, excuse my language.\u201d\n\nNathaniel pressed a finger to the pointed end and the tooth wiggled. The sheen of blood at the gums made me nauseated. \u201cIt\u2019s okay Uncle Joe. It\u2019s a baby tooth. It\u2019s going to come out soon anyway, so maybe you can help it. You probably don\u2019t have to hit me that hard.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am **not** going to hit you.\u201d\n\nHe pushed away from the table and stomped into the kitchen. I heard a drawer open and utensils raining onto the floor. When I rose to find him, Nathaniel stood with a rolling pin in both hands. \u201cJesus! Stop!\u201d I shouted before he could eat the cylinder. My nephew looked despondent. \n\n\u201cSanta\u2019s dead! You won\u2019t help!\u201d \n\n\u201cI said I wasn\u2019t going to hit you,\u201d I replied, putting away the mess. \u201dI didn\u2019t say I wasn\u2019t going to help. There are better ways to pull teeth.\u201d Nathaniel\u2019s face lit up like a Christmas tree.\n\nAfter a few false starts, the old floss and doorknob trick managed to yank his loose tooth and it clattered on the bathroom tile. Eyes wide, Nathaniel held it like pure gold. \u201cWe did it. We\u2019re going to get shum anshers tonight.\u201d  \n\n\u201cOkay, but the tooth fairy only comes by when you\u2019re asleep, right? Why don\u2019t you get ready for bed.\u201d Having gained his trust, the boy relaxed and hugged me. I forgot how strong a child\u2019s beliefs could be, what it felt like to be heard. \n\nNathaniel finished his homework and changed into pajamas, never losing sight of the tooth. As he pushed it under his pillow, I hoped he would just sleep off the entire notion. I returned to the living room and watched TV, trying to come up with a plausible reason for Sean, one that would explain why his son had a new gap in his mouth. \n\nI heard a muffled thud from his bedroom followed by a high-pitched yell. Bounding over the couch, I sprinted to his door and turned on the lights. On the cartoon playmat that doubled as a rug, Nathaniel was on all fours, breathing erratically. I didn\u2019t notice the twinkle of fairy dust until he raised his closed hand, and two tiny arms twitched between his fingers.\n\n\u201cI got him, Uncle Joe! I got the tooth fairy!\u201d Shaking his fist made the room echo with luminous bells. \u201cIsh the real deal!\u201d \n\nI should have taken the action figure out of his hand and put Nathaniel back to bed. I should have pissed off my brother and told the little guy the truth. In the end, I did neither.  \n\n\u201cLet me go! Let me go! You\u2019re never getting another dollar again!\u201d\n\nI moved closer to Nathaniel\u2019s fist. \u201cThat\u2019s tough talk for a pixie that\u2019s about to get his wings clipped. Now spill it. What do you know about the Santa case?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, Shpill it! Don\u2019t make me get rough.\u201d \n\nI covered my nephew\u2019s hands so the fairy couldn\u2019t hear. \u201cMaybe we should do a good cop bad cop routine, see if he\u2019ll talk more.\u201d  Nathaniel was giddy as I let go again. \u201cNow let\u2019s be reasonable, TF. I know you got nothing to do with his Christmas frackas, but my partner here needs some convincing, you know what I mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t hear nuthin.\u201d The boy punched his pillow and muffled *oomphs* followed. \u201cAlright alright, I\u2019ll talk. Now you didn\u2019t hear this from me, but I heard something about him getting into a scuffle with the Easter Bunny. Something about the sanctity of the holidays.\u201d\n\n\u201cShankcity?\u201d I tried to suppress my smile but his lisp was adorable. \n\n\u201cYeah, I heard they were going to hash it out someplace neutral... Cleveland.\u201d\n\n\u201cUncle Joe! We have to go to Cleveland!\u201d \n\n\u201cWell, we can\u2019t get there tonight,\u201d I said. \u201cMaybe you can ask your parents tomorrow, when I\u2019m not around.\u201d\n\nThe pixie spoke again. \u201cI was jusht heading there myshelf. Gotta finish my rounds.\u201d The room darkened and a small glowing portal opened just below the window. *That was unexpected*. My nephew opened his hand and a yellow fairy shook his draped toga before flapping his wings. Pocketing the tooth, he tossed a dollar coin and Nathaniel caught it. \u201cYou guys coming or what?\u201d\n\nWe stared at each other for a moment, sharing the awkward silence before following the little man. *Play along*, my brother had said, and there was no way I wasn\u2019t going to see this through to the end.",

        "FWIW, no.  I don\u2019t want our lake Erie bros to become rivals, I *like* having a second team to root for when we\u2019re not playing.  That said they\u2019d have to do something monumentally stupid to qualify for \u2018hated\u2019 status if it happened.\n\nI want to keep the ratbirds close for a number of reasons:\n\n* The hated status.  How many here could create a plausible story like ours? 2 rival teams in the same division with historic Browns roots, the one in question placed there by a seemingly-vindictive league/set of owners within most of our living memories.\n\n* And I know this\u2019ll get some scorn, but we currently have the potential to grow a team for a few years, a good/great/dynastic team.\n\n* Nothing lasts forever. We\u2019ll get good as the ratbirds decline.  Our time.  No, \u2018next year\u2019 is unacceptable.  (I wouldn\u2019t wish injuries on any team, not even to win a few Fantasy games.)\n\n* If there was a league expansion/realignment I\u2019d still want \u2018em here.\n\n Yeah, ok, plausibility. :)\n\nRelated question: when were we last actual rivals with the Bengals?",

        "Michigan offers Hunter Major\n\nScholarship\n\nSchool Visit (5/5)\n\nCoach Visit (3/3)\n\nOver before it even started, it\u2019s unfortunate your dad could never show his stuff in the pros. He was such a joy to watch in college. \n\nYour story however, could be quite different. \n\nEvery player I\u2019ve sent to the NBL from Michigan has had a prominent role in the league. From Dontavious MacLean (SG), the 60-million dollar man who was the sixth-man on the NBL finalist Pelicans in his rookie season to Maurice Milton (PG), ROTY over players like Jai Bryant and Rod Hayes, my players never disappoint. \n\nThe funny thing is, those were my two lowest drafted players at Michigan, excluding Kyle Peterson, who hasn\u2019t gotten a chance to show his stuff on the Lakers as a rookie just yet. \n\nIn 2051, Rajon Joyce (G) was selected 5th overall, and he\u2019s had an excellent offseason this year. There are rumors of a max extension coming his way in 2054. \n\nIn 2052, Nate Wright parlayed a NPOY award into the 4th overall pick, and put up 22/10 as a rookie while earning a spot on the Second-Team All-Defense. \n\nAnd our crown jewel is Kyle Edo (PG), the #1 pick in this last draft, who is likely to make an All-NBL team as a rookie. With Doug Buie (GF) and Anthony Borucki (GF) also lottery selections, it\u2019s clear we\u2019re the place to be for NBL-bound players, especially for guards such as yourself. \n\nAnd having NBL success goes hand-in-hand with a prestigious program. Last season was once-in-a-lifetime for most NCBCA programs, but it\u2019s the expectation for us. \n\nIt was not the first title game for the Michigan program. No, it was the sixth title game we\u2019ve participated in, and the second of the decade. A mere 6 years ago, we won a title, and we\u2019ve made two consecutive Elite Eights. \n\nBut Michigan's success predates my arrival greatly. in the 20\u2019s and 30\u2019s, Michigan experienced success few other teams have seen. Eighteen Sweet Sixteen appearances, eight Elite Eights, 8 Final Fours, and the aforementioned title appearances, there hasn\u2019t been a decade Michigan was not dominant in, appearing in a final four in every full one the NCBCA has existed. \n\nThe Big North is no different, where Michigan has won the regular season twelve times and the Big North tournament six. If you take a comprehensive look at the achievements of programs, Michigan is no doubt top 5. \n\nAnd the Michigan campus is a sight to behold. With the Huron River running right beneath campus, the greenery is absolutely stunning. Many students take a break from their studies to walk around Nichols Arboretum, the 123-acre nature reserve with 3.5 miles of hiking trail that is immediately off campus. The Matthaei botanical gardens are just to the East, with different floral displays for each season. \n\nTo the Southeast, we have the Furstenberg Nature Area, a wetlands reserve with picnic tables for a nice outdoor afternoon in the spring. \n\nTo the West, the most woody of the nature reserves, Black Pond Woods Nature Area, sits, a 34-acre area that has some light hiking trails for a nice Saturday afternoon. Just next door is the Leslie golf course, a quiet place to play either 9 or the full 18, and hope your ball doesn't roll into the creek. \n\nAnd of course in the winter students head up to Mt. Brighton in droves, decked out in ski gear. Sometimes, the team takes a bonding trip up there to point and laugh at me as I fall down trying to participate. Same thing happens with ice skating actually, at the Buhr Park Outdoor Ice Arena, for some reason I\u2019ve just never been able to get it down. \n\nBut obviously the main attraction in the area is Lake Erie. Growing up in NorCal, I thought Lake Tahoe was massive, but this puts that to shame, spanning from Detroit to Niagara Falls. From fishing to kayaking to dinner cruises, it\u2019s like we live next to our own personal ocean. \n\nFrom NCBCA to NBL success, and some of the most stunning views in the country, Ann Arbor is the place for you. You\u2019ll build an even bigger legacy than your father. \n\nWC: 689",

        "&gt;  **Article:**\n\n**Start knocking on doors, Joe Biden, or you can wave goodbye to Ohio**\n\n*Trump has staunch support among rural and non-college-educated white voters in Ohio*\n\nSarah Baxter\nSunday September 27 2020, 12.01am BST, The Sunday Times\n\nThere is a saying: \u201cAs Ohio goes, so goes the nation.\u201d No Republican has ever won the White House without winning the Buckeye State. The first presidential debate of three gets under way on Tuesday in Cleveland, the former industrial powerhouse on the shores of Lake Erie, and I\u2019m here to take the political temperature for personal reasons. It was my mother\u2019s hometown.\n\nIf the rest of Ohio were like Cleveland, Joe Biden would win by a landslide. Frankly, he could make a complete fool of himself against Donald Trump on debate night and still take the city. Even the swankiest suburb, Shaker Heights, made famous by Celeste Ng\u2019s novel Little Fires Everywhere \u2014 now a Netflix drama starring Reese Witherspoon \u2014 is a Democratic stronghold.\n\nHowever, Biden needs a blowout in this, Ohio\u2019s second-largest city (population: 380,000), to counter Trump\u2019s staunch support among rural and non-college-educated white voters in the state. The most recent Ohio poll was effectively a dead heat, with Biden on 44.9% and Trump on 44.3%. Who is winning the ground game? The question is causing sleepless nights in the Democratic camp.\n\nI hadn\u2019t been back to my grandmother\u2019s house since I was 12 (she died a year later). I lived with her for a short time when I was five and remember learning to tie my shoelaces in her hall and to tell the time from the big clock on her kitchen wall. She lived in a peeling clapboard house with a swing on the porch in Cleveland Heights, now \u2014 as I was to discover \u2014 a neighbourhood for hipsters that has been thoroughly gentrified. There were at least a dozen Biden-Harris lawn signs on her old street. The one that made me laugh, though, said: \u201cAny Functioning Adult 2020.\u201d If Biden wins, this will be the slogan that propelled him to the White House.\n\nPerhaps things hadn\u2019t changed as much as I thought. My mother used to say that everyone on the American side of our family was a \u201cyellow dog Democrat\u201d \u2014 meaning they would vote for a mangy hound over any Republican candidate. Loyalties forged in the Great Depression, when Franklin D Roosevelt was president, were passed down the generations.\n\nToday the left is more defined by cultural values. The street had just as many Black Lives Matter signs as Biden ones, though its residents were predominantly white. I stopped for a while to talk to Nolan Konkoski, the owner of a bohemian bar, Soho Chicken + Whiskey, who was on his porch enjoying the warm evening. \u201cThis community is very liberal, very supportive of human rights,\u201d he said. His 11-year-old daughter has rejected gender norms and goes by the neutral pronoun \u201cthey\u201d. Her local school is diverse and minority white: \u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons we love the area.\u201d Unlike the private schools, it is teaching remotely.\n\nKonkoski has had to shut his bar for months and despises Trump\u2019s attitude to \u201cscience\u201d and his bungling of the pandemic. I asked if he would be watching the debate. \u201cI can\u2019t stand to listen to Trump\u2019s nonstop bluster, but it\u2019s such an important election we\u2019ll probably tune in for a bit. I can\u2019t imagine that anyone is undecided, honestly.\u201d\n\nEven so, the battle for every last vote is going to the wire. Down the road, the local Republican office was staffed by three black volunteers. This was not my grandmother\u2019s GOP.\n\nChairs were laid out in anticipation of a get-out-the-vote rally with some of Trump\u2019s most prominent African-American supporters, who are rolling through Cleveland on a national bus tour this weekend. I asked if Trump might drop by ahead of the debate. \u201cI wish,\u201d one of the volunteers replied.\n\nBiden, to be sure, retains the overwhelming support of the black community. Alan Leigh, the black author of The Secret Code of the Scrolls, who was born in the area, told me: \u201cTrump has opened the door to people feeling more comfortable with racist behaviour.\u201d He is also worried about election night itself. \u201cI believe Biden has a chance but Trump is very crafty. The election can be stolen.\u201d\n\nFirst, however, the Democrats have to amass the greatest number of votes. Party organisers fear they are fighting with one hand tied behind their backs after the Biden campaign issued strict instructions against in-person meetings and door-to-door canvassing because of the pandemic.\n\nThe impact is difficult to predict. No party has tried to win before with a \u201cvirtual\u201d ground game. Ryan Puente, the executive director of the Democratic Party in Cuyahoga county (greater Cleveland), said: \u201cWe\u2019re getting creative with a lot of pop-up, drive-through events, texting and leaflet drops, but yes, I\u2019m nervous. I\u2019m worried that other parts of the state and county don\u2019t have our resources.\u201d\n\nSome elements of the campaign are whirring at full throttle. Democrats hope the enthusiasm of suburban women will give their candidate a strong boost. Monique Smart, who is running for the state legislature on the outskirts of the city, said: \u201cThese are my ladies. They used to vote Republican but are rejecting Trump\u2019s nastiness.\u201d\n\nA group calling itself the Bay Village Nasty Women (which derives its name from Trump\u2019s epithet for his 2016 rival, Hillary Clinton) has taken over much of the get-out-the-vote push. \u201cNone of this is being supported by the Biden campaign. We are leading ourselves,\u201d Smart said.\n\nOne jittery Democrat pointed me to an article on Michigan, another battleground state, in last week\u2019s Time magazine, where Charlotte Alter wrote: \u201cBiden\u2019s campaign is all but invisible to the naked eye. His lack of a physical footprint is all the more striking because Trump flags festoon everything from pickup trucks to massive airplane parts being transported down the highway.\u201d\n\nIn Cleveland, there have been noisy boat rallies for Trump on Lake Erie and there will be a horn-tooting, flag-waving vehicle parade this weekend. It is all about spreading enthusiasm and scraping up every possible vote, even though the Republicans have no chance of winning here.\n\nLisa Stickan, the chairwoman of the Republican Party in Cuyahoga county, claimed there was a \u201clarger energy\u201d in the Trump campaign. They are holding a lot of meetings by Zoom but they are also canvassing on the streets \u201cin masks, and respecting social distancing for the comfort of voters\u201d, she said.\n\nThe election forecaster Rachel Bitecofer, an expert on the Midwestern swing states, believes the Democrats have \u201cunilaterally disarmed\u201d.\n\nIn her view there has been a striking degree of stasis in the race \u2014 the polls haven\u2019t budged much in months \u2014 but victory will go to the candidate who can persuade \u201clatent partisans\u201d to show up who might otherwise not bother to vote.\n\n\u201cFace-to-face door-knock contact is the most effective way of getting someone to the polls,\u201d she told me. Her verdict is blunt. The Biden campaign might succeed despite its absence on the ground, but \u201cin my opinion, it is guilty of political malpractice\u201d.\n\nSorry, Grandma, but there aren\u2019t enough yellow dog Democrats to be sure of winning this.",

        "Why I want to bet 8,000$ on Florida to win the cup in 2021 at 50/1 odds (I\u2019m a Calgary fan btw)\n\nSergei Bobrovsky: \n\nHad a rough rough year after signing a big big contract. Scary right. Bobs SV% of .900 ranks last out of all goalies to play 50 games this year. His .900 also is the 2nd worst of his career, his worst being his 2nd season with the Flyers (.899). \n\nBobs SV% has dropped each year since 2016-17 from .931 to today\u2019s .900 despite playing for a stingy Blue Jackets team. \n\nIt\u2019s quite safe to say that Bobrovsky didn\u2019t have a stellar group in front of him, but adjustments can be made. It was HC Quennevilles first season in charge, and Bobrovskys first season with FLA. HC was still figuring out the team and Bobrovsky was adapting to a vastly different style of play. Bob wants to win and various players and coaches have stated on record how much this guy HATES losing. I expect Bob to have a bounce back year. He\u2019s starting at the bottom and his level of play can only increase. It helps that Matheson is gone. \n\n\nDefense: \n\nThis group has to figure out a lot, but GM Bill Zito is coming from a very good defensive CBJ team. I guarantee he and HC have already shared ideas and visions for the team next season. Getting rid of matheson was the first step, but getting in another piece will be crucial. Crucial. Krug has some connections in Florida with Vatrano, and Acciari, but I don\u2019t quite think he will make an impact that they need. Lebrun recently reported that Florida could be a dark horse for Pietrangelo. Zito is used to having a sure fire Top Dman in Seth Jones And he must be considering Pietrangelo. The panthers have had public issue with their winning culture, with chris pronger going as far as to bash it in an Athletic interview. That is very, very concerning and Pietrangelo is the best player on the market that a team could possibly want to fix that problem. Pietrangelo captained St Louis to a Stanley cup victory. If the panthers can sign him, the culture in the locker room will be vastly different and incredibly unique. Having HC, GM, Horny, Pietrangelo all bouncing ideas off eachother has the potential to wreak absolute havoc. Zito won the Calder cup championship in 2016 with the Lake Erie Monsters. HC has won the Stanley cup 3 times with Chicago 2010, 2013, 2015. Horny has won it 2016 and 2017. Pietrangelo won in 2019. Brett Connolly won the stanley cup in 2018. \n\nFlorida has representatives from Stanley cup winners from 7 out of the last 10 years, all key representatives (Connolly may be a stretch). Florida has members from the 2010, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019 Stanley cup winners. Key members at that, which is very rare. \n\nI want the panthers to avoid Gothisbehere as I think he could be a second coming of Mike Matheson. Ghost just needs the right team to thrive , but I believe it will be hard to find a perfect fit for him. \n\n\n\nForwards: \n\n\nAleksander Barkov is no longer underrated! Huberdeau (78) had only 7 points less than Kucherov last season. However most of his points came from assists, and if Dadonov And Hoffman leave the panthers will have major problems. The panthers have the space to sign them both but I\u2019m not sure their sentiment. It seems like Hoffman is gone (could be a good thing as attitude problems but he is an effective goal scorer) while Dadonov has more potential to stay.  \n\nIf the T-6 can click, this panthers team will be scary if the d can shape themselves out. \n\nI am very intrigued by the Panthers forward depth and I find that they are a highly underrated group despite their mediocre point totals. \n\nVatrano, Connolly, Saarela, Acciari, Haula, Wallmark, And Boyle can do heavy damage, but. BUT. HC needs to figure out the best set of line combinations. I haven\u2019t watched every game of the season so I\u2019m not sure how often he tinkered with the combos, but I am very intrigued by their play making abilities. All of them (albeit Boyle) are playdrivers who can make things happen in the neutral and offensive zone. It hasn\u2019t shown on the score sheet but I believe that\u2019s due to HC not having found the right combo. Owen Tippet has shredded the AHL And many in NHL circles think he will make the Panthers this season and provide in house replacement for goals that may be lost due to Dadonov And or Hoffman leaving. If Tippet can make a T-6 impact that would be phenomenal and increase Florida\u2019s chances exponentially. HC has a lot to work with and has a difficult task ahead of him, but the rewards are huge. \n\n\nLineup and Cap Implications \n\nHuberdeau (5.9) Barkov (5.9) Dadonov (5.5-6)\n\nHoffman (6-6.75). ???????       Hornqvist(5.3) \n\nVatrano (2.53)     Haula (2-2.75)  Connolly (3.5) \n\nAcciari (1.6)      Boyle (940k)    Tippet (863k) \n\nWallmark (2.5-3.25) \n\n\n\nYandle (6.3).    Ekblad (7.5) \n\nStillman (773k).  Stralman (5.5) \n\n?                             ? \n\n\n\n\nBob (10) \n\nDriedger (850k) \n\n\n\n\n\nThe panthers are left with 2.3M according to the moves above. This leaves them in quite the predicament while still needing a bonafide #2C and a 3rd pairing. In my estimates of contracts, I believe I was generous to the players. Depending on how Zito plays it however, there may be a lot more room left over due to the flat cap. \n\nI think not signing Dadonov And Hoffman would be a mistake and would leave a glaring need for scoring. I don\u2019t think it would be worth it to sign pietrangelo if that meant Dadonov And Hoffman couldn\u2019t be kept. \n\nStr\u00e5lman is no longer a T-4 Dman in the league but would be a very serviceable 3rd pairing RD. Not many defense prospects are in the pipeline compared to the abundance of high ceiling low floor offensive talent Florida begrudgingly has compiled. \n\nIf Dadonov And Hoffman do walk, I think Florida should take a look at Granlund and Kovy. Granlund is coming off a 5.75M contract and had an awful season. That would be a great value buy for Zito who can pickup a Granlund on the cheap and with little leverage. Kovy rebounded with the Canadians and was quite in the playoffs and it will be interesting to see what he commands but I think he could be a solid option for Florida with the ability to move up and down the lineup. If Granlund can regain form and takeover the question mark positon of 2C, I think Zito might find himself in voting for GM of the year. \n\nFlorida has many offensive prospects, but their impact  is very questionable. Best case scenario would be if Tippet, Heponiemi, Borgstrom, And Denisenko show up to camp in prime shape and all step into the lineup right away to make a difference. The chances of that are low though but their is always a possibility for a surprise. \n\n\nI haven\u2019t watched all Florida games, but my opinions are based off much observation. Please correct any statements I have made so we can discuss below. \n\nI am very curious to hear what people have to say and I am intrigued to talk about the Top 9 forward group and the possible successful line combos as I think this group has a lot of potential. Hopefully HC JQ has used this season has a learning curve. Only up.",

        "I grew up just outside of Chicago and moved to Rochester for college in '95. I've been here ever since and can't imagine leaving. While there aren't the cultural centers and events on the scale there are in Chicago, pretty much by default, there are a lot of things you can find as you dig around for them. There is a very rich history in the city of Rochester. As has been noted already (you've got a lot of good responses!) the population of the city itself is pretty diverse and actually darn close to equal black/white population. There is also a way laid back pace here as compared to what I was used to growing up. For example, often if I'm on an expressway past 7pm, I will be passing most people even if I'm just doing the 55 mph speed limit. Yes there are exceptions, obviously, but it's just a mellow city like that overall. I also firmly believe that beauty can be seen anywhere as long as the mind is open to it and Rochester is definitely no exception. \n\nFor your outdoorsy husband, I can say that I have been all over, to so many of the places with great trails and scenery, either to walk them, ride them, or drive through them. There's soooo much more than just the well known places. After 25 years of actively seeking out the outdoor places, I'm still finding more. As a cyclist, the roads in and around Rochester are fabulous to ride. The further outside of the city you get, the more you get into rolling hills and just fantastic cycling. As far as parks go, right in the city there are some great places to be, from Genesee Valley Park to Turning Point Park which access paved pathways along the Genesee River. There is also Highland Park and the nearby Cobbs Hill reservoir. Those are great places to enjoy some nature and even see great sights without having to go far. I live about 20 miles away from them, on the other side of the city, and frequent those spots. With the open roadways, it's very easy to just decide to go places that aren't necessarily all that close, per se.  Beyond that Mendon Ponds Park has something for just about everyone. Rolling roads, beautiful scenery, great trails, ponds that can be fished, kayaked, etc. Black creek park is also beautiful and quite expansive, though much more flat. Oatka Creek Park is further away but large and some fantastic trails and things to see. Lots of smaller parks within the metropolis that offer a great day out. Corbett's Glen, nestled into mostly residential type area that is easy to pass right by if you're not looking for it. Ellison Park is on the east side and is essentially at the south end of the valley at the end of Irondequoit Bay. The park offers great trails, places for family outings and larger gatherings, fantastic kayaking either to it from the bay or to up to the bay from the park. I feel like there's literally hundreds of great places I'm not thinking of specifically right now. If you (or he) like day trips, if you get out into the finger lakes region, there is beauty and trails and lakes and scenery that I think rival anything anywhere. \n\nTo specifically address the weather, it won't be much different than what you're used to in Ohio if you're from closer to Lake Erie. My family is all still around Chicago and I see that I basically get the same weather they have, just 2 days later. \ud83d\ude00Yes, there is more lake effect snow than Chicago because that city sits on the west side of the water but the conditions here were really no adjustment at all from that as far as temperatures go. You will probably find that there is more snow here and just need to plan more time for driving and things like that. If your husband is not used to snow at all, I could see that being a significant adjustment for him. A side note to that- when I was younger, I hated snow and winter. Then I married at 22 and my wife had a different mindset which I was able to embrace and it very, very literally has been a conscious decision to embrace the very unique seasons and see the beauty in each and love them all for what they are. As in life, something to look forward to makes a world of difference and that's how I view the seasons. When it's cold and you get tired of it, there's summer to look forward to and when it's hot in the summer, there's the cooler and even cold months to look forward to. It's like a never-ending, refreshing revolving door of things to enjoy and also to look forward to. \ud83d\ude00\n\nPersonally I am presently a member of a large Methodist church that I think is fantastic but does happen to be in an area with less diversity so all I can say on that subject is that I'm sure you will find a place where you can fit in and feel at home. There are churches everywhere, and tons of very diverse congregations in the city. \n\nWith all the responses you have, I have no idea if you will even see mine but if you do, I wish to extend to you a very warm welcome to Rochester!",

It's just so full of badass and hype moments! Like [Yuyu blocking three attacks from different angles](https://i.imgur.com/5UuUhOW.png) or the [long range Neunwelt Tactic between the Hitotsuyanagi Squad](https://i.imgur.com/PhHKb01.png) to bypass the barrier made by that Huge. \n\nI also love the moment when the Huge stole the Magie sphere and [Yuyu and Riri had to chase after it while arguing with each other!](https://i.imgur.com/11c7txQ.png) And of course the hypest moment of it all was when every Lily of Yurigaoka kept passing the Magie sphere until it ended back to the Hitotsuyanagi Squad where all seven of them [had to catch it](https://i.imgur.com/ycfdo1A.png) so they can pass it to Yuyu and Riri [for the finishing blow!](https://i.imgur.com/VwtMsjw.png) It's so good!\n\n\nOf course after all that hype we had to comeback and chill with the girls [with a hot spring popping out of nowhere](https://i.imgur.com/Z1Ufttb.png) after that huge explosion with [Yuyu and Riri finally getting their very first alone time in the bath](https://i.imgur.com/IoQhfpF.png).\n\nThe final act of the episode though wasn't as hype as the first but it was just as important. With the Huge earlier stealing Magie from the Ruler of the Huge nest in their area, it has now weakened giving them the perfect opportunity to eliminate the ruler along with the nest. [I love that Yuyu and Riri just drops in on a parasol Mary Poppins style](https://i.imgur.com/RPhizJF.png). It wasn't even that complicated. They just had to stab [the Dainsleif that Mogu reprogrammed](https://i.imgur.com/itjoikh.png) into the Ultra-Huge.\n\nI was wondering how they'd escape that. Didn't expect [their uniforms to turn into an escape bubble.](https://i.imgur.com/Y548POH.png) And we get one final scene between [Riri and Yuri](https://i.imgur.com/AYtMdlf.png) which was a bit heartbreaking to see.  [It is good to know my guess from last week was completely incorrect.](https://i.imgur.com/avfx4ZH.png) Misuzu didn't deliberately sabotaged her Dainsleif to make the Huge go wild. At least that's what Riri tells us. \n\n[And holy fuck!](https://i.imgur.com/vbYHJVE.png) Now I'm a bit disappointed that they didn't fight the Ultra-Huge! That thing is massive! Oh well, at least we did get to see [Mogu and Miliam finally making the pledge](https://i.imgur.com/xbQevGB.png) which was adorable. \n\n\nThat's it for Assault Lily I suppose! Definitely one of my favourite shows this season! For a show that's genuinely well made with some of the best action scene animations this season, has and plenty of yuri and fanservice, I'm surprised this show isn't more popular in this sub. Oh well. I just hope more people will give this show a shot now that it's complete. And \n\nI aso hope we get another season too! Now that they've destroyed the nest in their area, maybe we can see them interacting with outher Lily schools and maybe even see them go against shady organizations trying to take advantage of Lilies. Seriously, I do believe that this show has plenty of potential to tell more stories!",

        "The city was actually named after Buffalo Creek. The question comes up as to how the river got its name. There's theories that it was called the \"Beautiful River\" by the French (*Beau Fleuve*) but that doesn't stand up to a whole lot of scrutiny either, and the competing theory leads back to the idea that bison did at one time roam as far east as where Orleans County now sits. According to *The Extermination of the American Bison*, by  William T. Hornaday:\n\n&gt;Keating, on the authority of Colhoun, however, has cited a passage from Morton\u2019s \u201cNew English Canaan\u201d as proof of their former existence in the neighborhood of this lake. .....  \"They \\[the Indians\\] have also made descriptions of great heards of well growne beasts that live about the parts of this lake \\[Erocoise\\] such as the Christian world (untill this discovery) hath not bin made acquainted with. ......   The \u2018beast\u2019 to which allusion is here made \\[says Professor Allen\\] is unquestionably the buffalo, but the locality of Lake \u2018Erocoise\u2019 is not so easily settled. Colhoun regards it, and probably correctly, as identical with Lake Ontario. ...... The extreme northeastern limit of the former range of the buffalo seems to have been, as above stated, in western New York, near the eastern end of Lake Erie. That it probably ranged thus far there is fair evidence.\"\n\n(from [https://www.gutenberg.org/files/17748/17748-h/17748-h.htm#ii\\_geographical\\_distribution](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/17748/17748-h/17748-h.htm#ii_geographical_distribution))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo be fair, I was thinking about this last weekend, my initial thought was something along the lines of the Bills being one of the least fear-inspiring names, but when I thought about it more, there are other teams that only have a loose heritage connection as well - 49ers, Texans, Browns.... Even the Steelers. \n\nNot every team has a strong link to their name. Here's a rundown of every current team's name/identity, for comparison:\n\n* Arizona Cardinals - originally the Chicago Cardinals, named the Cardinals due to their purchasing of used (faded) maroon colored jerseys that someone commented \"That's not maroon, that's cardinal red.\"\n* Green Bay Packers - founded by a meat packing company (The Indian Packing Company)\n* Chicago Bears - named because they played in the same stadium as the Cubs and the owner considered them physically \"bigger\" than baseball players.\n* New York Giants - wanted name recognition with the baseball team, which in turn was allegedly named because of the skyscrapers in the city.\n* Philadelphia Eagles - inspired by the Eagle symbol used by FDR's National Recovery Act Program\n* Washington Football Team (The Artist formerly known as The Redskins) - At the time the Boston Braves, changed to the Redskins to keep the Native American connection, but to differentiate from the MLB Boston Braves.\n* Detroit Lions - inspired by the MLB Tigers, but considered lions to be the \"monarch\" (aka king) of the jungle, hoping to \"be the monarch of the league\".\n* Los Angeles Rams - Originally the Cleveland Rams, inspired by the then GM's favorite college team, the Fordham Rams.\n* Pittsburgh Steelers - Changing from the Pirates, simply because a local steel-worker submitted the name in a Change-The-Name contest.\n* San Fransisco 49ers - named for the gold-rush era settlers in 1849.\n* Cleveland Browns - named for Paul Brown.\n* Indianapolis Colts - originally the Baltimore Colts, picked in a team naming contest, partially in homage to the Baltimore Colts team that had existed previously and folded just 2 years earlier, and because the Baltimore area was well known for horse-breeding (which is likely why the original team had that name).\n* Dallas Cowboys - Originally supposed to be named the Steers, Texas Schramm didn't want the team identified as castrated cattle, so he went with Cowboys due to Texas's history of being known for cowboys.\n* Denver Broncos - Team naming contest, Denver being known for wild broncos roaming the area.\n* Los Angeles Chargers - Team naming contest, inspired by the \"Charge\" bugle cry during games.\n* Buffalo Bills - As discussed, picked out of a team naming contest to reference the AAFC team, which was in turn named for Buffalo Bill Cody.\n* New England Patriots - originally Boston Patriots, team naming contest, inspired by the patriots, as in the early defenders of the US independence. \n* Las Vegas Raiders - originally the Oakland Raiders, team naming contest, picked the second-highest voted name because of controversy that the original voting was fixed, which would have named them the Se\u00f1ors instead.\n* Minnesota Vikings - honoring the nordic tradition of the northern-midwest.\n* New York Jets - Shea stadium was close to LaGuardia Airport... (And you thought the Bills name reference was weak...)\n* Kansas City Chiefs - (originally the Dallas Texans) chosen for the large native american population in the area, also possibly because the mayor's nickname was \"The Chief\".\n* Atlanta Falcons - team naming contest, because they're \"proud and dignified birds\" and also \"deadly\".\n* Miami Dolphins - team naming contest, over 600 entries for Dolphins, \"the smartest creature of the sea\".\n* New Orleans Saints - team naming contest, chosen as a nod to the song \"When the Saints go marching in\".\n* Cincinnati Bengals - Honoring a previous Bengals franchise ('37-'41), chosen over Buckeyes, which was the most popular suggestion in a team naming contest.\n* Seattle Seahawks - team naming contest, the aggressive \"soaring\" birds are prominent in the northwest.\n* Tampa Bay Buccaneers - team naming contest, honoring the pirates who raided Florida's coast 300+ years earlier.\n* Carolina Panthers - \"symbolized what an NFL team should be\" according to team owners.\n* Jacksonville Jaguars - team naming contest, the Jacksonville zoo housed the oldest jaguar in the US.\n* Baltimore Ravens - team naming contest, honoring Baltimore native Edgar Allen Poe.\n* Tennessee Titans - team naming contest, chosen for \"strength, leadership, and other heroic qualities\" by the owner.\n* Houston Texans - the sixth professional football team to use the name, going back to the early days of the NFL. (No background given on the original Texans name specifically, probably just to honor the state.)\n\nStolen and paraphrased from [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovdbrdCIP7U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovdbrdCIP7U) cutting out all the moves and league information.",

        "**Python**\n\nThis was the hardest day for me, I had to leave part two and come back to it today.\n\nTook a while to come up with a data structure that would make the moves efficiently. After a bit of thought today I realized I could use a (single) linked list with a dictionary from cup label to list node. Code: [github (v1)](https://github.com/bsamseth/advent-of-code/blob/01df390d19653cd4dda2ed19ebc05dc7c99ebc6c/aoc-2020/day-23/day_23.py) runs in &lt; 15 seconds on my machine.\n\nAfter seeing a few solutions here in the megathread I saw people had the bright idea of embedding the entire linked list in a single array, where the nth index is the label of the cup that comes after the cup labeled n. So I took that idea and optimized it and got a final runtime of 0.6 seconds. A neat idea that I'll remember for the future!\n\n[github (final version)](https://github.com/bsamseth/advent-of-code/blob/master/aoc-2020/day-23/day_23.py) and [paste](https://topaz.github.io/paste/#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)",

        "When it comes to the protests and riots that have swept across the United States, there have been rumors about whether China is involved, which organizations are really behind them, and where their money is coming from. To learn more about this, we\u2019ve invited to speak with us Trevor Loudon. He has been researching radical and terrorist groups for more than 30 years, and has exposed these networks heavily as an author and filmmaker.\n\nMeanwhile, it\u2019s now being revealed that while Trump was continuing his work while undergoing treatment for COVID-19 at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Maryland, part of his work was to declassify intelligence related to the Russia investigation. The same day, the US attorney who had been assigned to review unmasking spy requests made by Obama administration officials, related to the Trump-Russia investigations, gave letters of resignation both to Attorney General William Barr and to President Donald Trump. This follows revelations that reports released by the Director of National Intelligence were missing details on unmasking data at the time of the 2016 election.\n\nThese stories and more in this episode of Crossroads.\n\n[\\#TrumpCovid](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23TrumpCovid) [\\#Semiconductor](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Semiconductor) [\\#TrevorLouden](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23TrevorLouden)\n\n\\- -

        "Regional Background:\n\nSince the 1980s the Great Lakes, often synonymous with the Rust Belt, has been a region experiencing a marked decline as factories closed and moved overseas. With the collapse of the United States government, this decline was only worsened, causing the region to fall into political extremism and militarism. In reaction to a series of Canadian interventions throughout the Great Lakes, several alliances before the former states were formed. The area they compete over has vast strategic importance, with Lake Superior, Huron, Michigan, Erie, and Ontario all flowing into each other and being connected to the sea by the Saint Lawrence River, the only way that most trade gets in and out of the region. Whoever emerges on top in the Great Lakes will have a great head start in reunifying the nation.\n\nThe Toronto Accord:\n\nNot all of the former states completely opposed Canadian presence in the region. These states saw them as a good bulwark against the Ohioans and socialists, and sought economic cooperation with Ottawa. While some would call them traitors, to them it\u2019s just business.\n\nIllinois:\n\nWith the Federal Collapse, Illinois\u2019s fate was uncertain. Home to Chicago, the nation\u2019s third largest city and the main hub of the Midwest, the state was rich both in capital and population. Not everyone in Illinois was happy with this, and many downstate feared domination by Chicago, even mounting a short lived independence movement for \u201cLittle Egypt\u201d. What was needed was a firm hand to put everyone in their rightful place, and Hillary Rodham would be the woman to do the job. Cutting all ties to her husband after he led the nation into ruin and fled to the Virgin Islands, Rodham returned to her hometown of Chicago and began to shape Illinois into a powerhouse. First putting down internal rebellions, and then launching incursions into Wisconsin, Indiana, and Michigan to put the entire Chicago Metro Area under its firm control. When Ohio began to pose a serious threat, Chicago made a deal with the devil. They signed comprehensive military and economic arrangements with the Canadians, tying their fates together. While the deal has made them rich, they also risk losing their sovereignty.\n\nSuperior:\n\nSince the state\u2019s inception, Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula was divided from the state\u2019s core both geographically and politically. Many \u201cYoopers\u201d had long desired independence, and  in 1996 their chance finally came. When Canada, unsettled by the socialist takeover in Michigan, sought to intervene, they found an ally in the Yoopers. In exchange for securing their independence, they ceded the strategic Strait of Mackinac to Ottawa, allowing them to control trade in Lake Michigan. While most Yoopers are happy with independence, the state has seen many political refugees flee there since the revolution in the Lower Peninsula, some of them having goals of reuniting the state.\n\nThe People\u2019s Pact:\n\nSeeing a common enemy in the Toronto Accord, the two left wing governments of the Great Lakes, Michigan and Minnesota, decided to throw their lots in together. They now cooperate militarily, as well as helping each other in their advancement towards American Socialism.\n\nMichigan:\n\nAs chaos spread throughout the country, Michigan\u2019s Rust Belt cities raged. Places like Detroit, Lansing, and Flint burned as rioters showed their discontent. When Governor Engler sought to use the state guard against them, rather than back down the rioters melded into what became a true revolutionary movement. Under the leadership of Flint local Michael Moore and through the organizational efforts of the Industrial Workers of the World, Engler soon had to flee to the Upper Peninsula, and the Red Flag flew over Lansing. The new government set out a program of rebuilding the state\u2019s crumbling infrastructure and industry, making sure that workers were in charge every step of the way. When Ohio tried invading, the people rallied and were able to hold them off. They were less successful against the combined pressure of Canada and Illinois, and ended up losing the city of Kalamazoo as well as the Strait of Mackinac. Both emboldened in their progress and embittered by their lost territories, Michigan now seeks to reassert itself and possibly go on to unite the entire country under the IWW banner.\n\nMinnesota:\n\nAs popular Senator Paul Wellstone returned home to St. Paul, he knew he would have his work cut out for him. Wellstone was one of the most left-wing, progressive members of Congress, and sought to enact his vision in his home state of Minnesota. Many in the state\u2019s more conservative rural areas, and many in the cities as well would need some convincing, however. Through investments in agriculture and fishing, Wellstone was able to win over most of the state. His most shining move was to unite the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul into one mega city that would serve as a revitalized new capital. While a pacifist, content to stay at peace with Minnesota\u2019s neighbors, the crisis in Michigan showed that their neighbors would not allow that to happen. As crisis struck the neighboring Dakotas, rather than let the region fall under Canadian influence. Minnesota invaded and annexed many of the state's eastern areas. Them and Michigan two are now committed to each other in the face of the great Northern Menace, though it is doubtful they will survive without foreign aid. \n\nThe Great Lakes Alliance:\n\nSeeing the events unfolding to their West and North, Ohio was not content to fall either to socialism or Canadian influence. Forming their own alliance with the other battered and conservative states in the region, those being Indiana and Wisconsin, the Buckeye State now hopes to lead the Great Lakes into a new period of prosperity and independence.\n\nOhio:\n\nAs chaos surrounded them, Ohio remained mostly stable. The state soon invaded the sparse ruins of Western Pennsylvania and New York, bringing most of the Ohio River Basin and Lake Erie coast under its control. This was met with hostility from Canada, who backed it up with their navy and destroyed nearly the entirety of the Ohioan fleet in Lake Erie, though thankfully not sending ground troops in. With the socialist revolution in their long rival of Michigan, Columbus saw a change to redeem itself, and launched another invasion. They made large initial gains, reaching as far as the suburbs of Detroit, but they were ultimately repelled by fervent people\u2019s militias. These two defeats caused Ohio to rethink its approach. Being thwarted by both Canada and Michigan, Ohio sought to form an alliance of states who opposed both forces, leading to the formation of the Great Lakes Alliance. Ohio\u2019s goal is now to kick out the Canadians and socialists, and to unite the Great Lakes region as an alliance of brotherly and independent states.\n\nIndiana:\n\nFormer Vice President to H.W. Bush, Dan Quayle promised his home state big things upon independence. This was interrupted, however, as Illinoisan troops flooded across the border, seizing the Northwest of the state as well as its entire coastline. This left Indiana crippled, and they surely would have collapsed had it not been for help from neighboring Ohio. Both states put aside their differences to unite against common enemies. Many fear Quayle\u2019s closeness to H.W. Bush though, especially after reports of him being smuggled into Virginia during a diplomatic visit to Appalachia. While Quayle denies any lingering ties to Bush, he has raised much suspicion.\n\nWisconsin:\n\nTrapped in between the Toronto Accord to their North and South, and socialist Minnesota to their West, Wisconsin was left in a tough position. While many hoped that as long as they did not step on any toes they would remain safe, this illusion was shattered by Illinois\u2019 seizure of Kenosha. In light of this crisis, Madison soon found common cause and enemies with the conservative governments of Ohio and Indiana, and joined the Great Lakes Alliance. However, they have not followed all of the rules of alliance, continuing to violate it by trading with Canada and Minnesota. Madison argues that it is necessary if they are to avoid complete economic collapse, it has strained tensions with their allies, with some doubting how loyal Wisconsin can ever truly be.",

The Obama administration dumped a ton of money at the locks to keep them operating, but they shut down for good in 2011 due to rotten 130 year old gate anchors. \n\nI worked for nine years at one of the oil terminals near Linnton. The locals wanted us gone so our property could be used for something cuter, like apartments and strip malls. We could hardly even scratch our nuts without the residents complaining. I swear there were people on the hill who just sat there and stared out their windows at us. We kept getting complaints about noise that either didn't exist or wasn't coming from us. We had to spend a bunch of money to prove it. When we had a ship tied up at the dock, the vigilance would really get crazy. The ship would blow some steam, and the phones would start ringing, with people accusing us of polluting. Then the nut jobs would surface. One clearly astute person insisted we had to cover the entire 45 acre terminal with a net to keep the birds out. Uh, okay, we'll get right on that. One of the guys next door at the BP terminal said that some whack job called and accused them of climbing the trees outside her house so they could look in her windows. I told him that if he ever wanted to really do that, I'm in. I love antagonizing the mentally unbalanced. \n\nPeople don't seem to realize that gasoline and diesel has to be transported and stored. It doesn't just show up at the corner gas station. \"Oh, I know that. It gets delivered in a tanker truck.\" Yeah, it does. But where does the truck get it? Some mystery location that's out of sight and out of mind? Nope, right here in this ugly terminal that everyone constantly bitches about. This place sprang into existence in 1925. Were they here then? \nSure, it's gotten bigger and bigger over the years, but so has Portland. And every oil company locates their terminals along the river for a reason, and that reason isn't to fuck up your view.  In fact, being on the river is a giant pain in the ass for us, but since fuel moves by marine transportation, we need a body of water connected to the ocean to make that happen. We have DEQ, the EPA, DOT, the city, our own corporate people, and above all the fucking Coast Guard crawling up our rectums, and now their NIMBY asses want to climb on. Take a number. \n\nBack in the 80's, some genius at the city wanted to move I-5 off of the east bank of the Willamette a quarter mile or so inland. Huh? Why? \nThey said it would increase the value of the land along the river by $100 million or so. Okay, fine, how much to relocate the freeway? Oh, about $325 million. I'm not an accountant, but trading $325M for $100M doesn't make a lot of fiscal sense. In fact, some might say it's a waste of money. Not to mention the nightmare of condemning all those businesses that would be in the way. \nThen there was the plan to \"cap\" I-405 to gain more land downtown. Jesus God Almighty, no. Thankfully, I haven't heard anymore about it in the last 10 years or so. \nBut it was awfully nice of the city to build the Eastbank Esplanade instead. Now the homeless and boat squatters have a great place to live. Too bad the people that paid for it don't get to use it. Same with the parks. Oh, sorry, they're not parks any more. They're campgrounds, open air shooting galleries, and garbage dumps. So is any accessible green space or urban path or trail. Yep, it's great having those places. Urban camping is the hottest thing right now. \nOh, I'm being harsh and judgmental? Maybe because this is my hometown. It used to be a decent place. No gangs, very few transients, no gentrification of the inner city pushing the low income people to the suburbs, police shootings were extremely rare, traffic was manageable and avoidable, housing was reasonable, people weren't piled on top of one another, most people owned their residences, a person could take public transit with no fear of getting killed, and as a matter of fact, you could go anywhere in town with no apprehension. If somebody fucked with you, the cops would actually show up when called. And nobody would shoot you to get \"street cred.\" And if you did get shot at, the shooter would actually aim, not spray a whole clip around and into someone's house where it kills a sleeping baby. \n\nI'm sorry about this rant, but I'm disheartened by what has happened to this place in the last 40 years. Some of it is inevitable, and unavoidable. Other issues, not so much. There's no leadership. Nobody wants to make the tough decisions. IMHO, the city government has never been all that effective, and it's only gotten worse. What they excel at, however, is raping, and/or ignoring, the people who pay the bills. The people who care about this city. The people who want to raise families here, because they themselves were raised here. I gave up on Portland ten years ago, and I don't see myself going back, ever. I do go back every work day, but I escape when my shift is over. I still own a house there, although I don't know why I keep paying taxes to one of the biggest wrongdoers around (that would be Multnomah Fucking County). \nI know, there's plenty of places worse. Some of you have come from those places (the Rust Belt, the Deep South, rural Midwest, etc). My dad came out here from Cleveland after the war, and stayed. Former NBA players came out here for a few seasons, and stayed when their gig was up. Even if they got traded, they kept houses here and came back when they retired. Doctors came out here for residencies at OHSU and stayed. Natives, like me, left to try someplace else and came back. You can't blame a person for wanting to improve their standard of living, so this isn't the usual \"get off my lawn\" rant. If I can move anywhere, you can too. I wish people would go elsewhere, but that's unrealistic and selfish. \n\nOh, since polluted waterways were mentioned, I would like to point out that the Willamette was basically an open sewer and industrial drainage ditch as recently as the early 1970's. It was fucking horrible. It was like a flowing, narrow version of Lake Erie. You could walk across it on the solid waste. People still bitch about the combined sewer, but that ain't nothin' compared to the days of yore. As a kid, anywhere I went on the riverbank had big signs warning people to stay out of the water, and for Christ's sake don't eat any fish you catch. A guy I worked with at the oil terminal told me about another terminal he worked for, and how he used to dump the plant's garbage off their dock every day. If they spilled any gas or diesel into the river, it was worth a shrug, and not much more.\n \nOnce in the late 80's, I was camping at Diamond Lake with friends when we struck up a conversation with our camp neighbor. He used to live in Portland, and when we started telling war stories about spring salmon in the Willamette, he didn't believe us. \"There's no way there's salmon in that greasy outflow.\" We finally convinced him that yes, there were, but he was horrified that we actually ate said fish. \"Inconceivable!\" (okay, I made that part up). But for the next three days, he repeatedly said how impressed he was that the Willamette had been cleaned up to the point you could actually eat fish caught there. And swim in it (although the water reeks at times). It even made it into National Geographic several times, with journalists lauding the successful cleanup. The lower 10 miles of river bottom is still a Superfund site, and probably always will be. The Big Pipe Project eliminated almost all of the CSO problems, so at least boneless corn-backed brown trout are rare now. \nSo Chicago, Seattle, and whomever can fuck off, our river is now clean as well. \nOnce again, I apologize for any vehemence, but this area is not just my birthplace, it's my identity. I've been here for more than 50 years. Yeah, I gave up on it, mostly because of indifferent and incompetent government, but that doesn't mean I don't give a shit. I look at it kind of like an ex-wife I had kids with. Maybe I can't stand the bitch, but I still care, because we'll always be intertwined.",

I hadn\u2019t been there again until my mid 30s, and began wondering if I\u2019d dreamt it or romanticized it because I was young. But no\u2014it\u2019s real! And I\u2019ve traveled the entire country a lot, and never found anything like it. If you enjoy hiking, it\u2019s by far the best of the state and it\u2019s all in one little area that has so much to explore you\u2019ll have to go back for years and you still won\u2019t have seen it all.\n\nAfter Hocking, here is everything that falls way behind it. If you\u2019ve seen Hocking, then you\u2019ve seen the best IMO. The rest is important for anyone who really wants to appreciate the state and it\u2019s diverse offerings. This is a hard state to market because it doesn\u2019t have any particular thing that jumps out, it has a bunch of them, and these are in no particular order:\n\n2. **Cedar Point**\u2014if you enjoy roller coasters, this is must-see. This park consistently ranks in the top 5 amusement parks *worldwide*. At least go once.\n\n3. **Museum of the US Air Force in Dayton**\u2014this place is huge, with silos full of rockets, missiles, and spacecraft, and hangars full of aircraft. It\u2019s exceptional enough to rival the Smithsonian\u2019s National Air &amp; Space Museum in DC.\n\n4. **Visit the Lake Erie Islands**. Put-in-Bay is a party town at night, but is still family friendly up till the last couple trips of the Miller Ferry. Kelleys Island is a lot more laid back. Rent a golf cart or bicycles (or being your own) and spend a day exploring and enjoying the views of the Lake.\n\n5. **Explore Cleveland**\u2014Downtown, University Circle, Little Italy, Ohio City, Tremont, and Gordon Square are great neighborhoods, and Lakewood and Cleveland Heights are very cool little suburbs. Cleveland has incredible cultural institutions like the Cleveland Museum of Art (free!), the Cleveland Orchestra (one of the world-renowned Big Five), Playhouse Square (largest theater district in the US besides NYC\u2019s Lincoln Center), the Cleveland Botanical Gardens, and the Cleveland History Museum/Crawford Auto &amp; Aviation Museum. Cleveland has a rich history and has seen a lot of renaissance in the last 10-20 years. It was known as America\u2019s \u201cSixth City\u201d since it spent a lot of time as the 6th largest in the country. A lot of its best cultural institutions remain, and some neighborhoods have been revitalized to have bustling nightlife and really beautiful urban parks. If you haven\u2019t visited, it\u2019s well worthwhile to see a mix of different urban environments from Downtown, which has stood in for NYC in Hollywood productions, to Little Italy, which feels so charming you can\u2019t believe you\u2019re still in Cleveland. If you like architecture, Cleveland has a lot of character from the skyscrapers and bridges downtown to the fancy neighborhoods around Edgewater Park and the museums around University Circle. There\u2019s a lot more here than just the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame.\n\n6. **Explore Cincinnati**\u2014I will yield to someone who knows more about the city because I haven\u2019t explored it anywhere near as much as it deserves. The riverfront here is very unique, with a beautiful riverwalk complete with riverboats and some very cool bridges. Cincinnati is another old great American city. It\u2019s got a lot of geographic layers to it too...since it\u2019s not on terrain that\u2019s as flat as Columbus or even as flat as Cleveland. This creates exceptional views of the state\u2019s most beautiful skyline. It also has a great market district just north of Downtown as well as a number of college neighborhoods, museums, and great breweries. Cincinnati is also full of some great architecture.\n\n7. **Go to a county fair**\u2014especially if it\u2019s the Lorain County Fair in Wellington or the Canfield Fair near Youngstown. The animals are cool to see, the food vendors are fun to try, and the tractor pulls and demolition derbies at the Lorain County Fair are fantastically entertaining.\n\n8. **Check out the small cities and small towns**\u2014Ohio has so many beautiful little towns that it\u2019s hard to believe! On your treks across the state to visit some of the things above, get off the freeways and drive through some of these places. Often you can find some unique shops, restaurants, or ice cream stands. Some have a college or two that adds an interesting vibe. Some suggestions: Delaware, Medina, Mt. Vernon, Athens, Oberlin, Yellow Springs, Zanesville, Chardon, Wooster...and I\u2019m sure there are plenty more. You probably don\u2019t need to go far to find some near you.\n\n9. **See an event at Blossom Music Center that\u2019s put on by the Cleveland Orchestra.** Yes, they have rock concerts here, but it\u2019s a completely different experience to see the Cleveland Orchestra, the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra, of Yo Yo Ma there. It\u2019s set amid a beautiful forest in the middle of the Cuyahoga Valley National Park, and it has acoustics that were designed for orchestral performances. It\u2019s awesome even on the lawn, where you can set up your folding chairs or picnic blankets and drink whatever wine you chose to bring. I think it has to be one of the most underrated activities in the entire Midwest. You don\u2019t even have to be a huge classical music fan\u2014they have shows where the orchestra plays the score live to films like Star Wars.\n\n10. **Ride the Ohio &amp; Erie Towpath Trail through Cuyahoga Valley National Park.** This is a great experience to commune with nature and the early settlement and industrialization of Ohio. The entire trail extends over 80 miles and will eventually stretch from Lake Erie in Downtown Cleveland to Dover/New Philly on the edge of Ohio\u2019s Amish Country. In CVNP, you can ride your bike in one direction on the Towpath and then ride the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad back to where you started.\n\n**Some other things worth mentioning:**\nColumbus: Explore Short North, the riverfront Downtown, German Village, and the OSU campus. I\u2019ve heard great things about the Columbus and Cincinnati Zoos. Check out Mid-Ohio: Mohican State Park, Malabar Farm, Mansfield Reformatory, Kingwood Center, and more. Take a hike or get tickets for Hale Farm &amp; Village in Cuyahoga Valley National Park. Visit the Great Lakes Medieval Faire or the Ohio Renaissance Festival. Go camping in a state park, go on a hay ride, go pick apples at an orchard and drink hot cider. Explore Ohio Wine Country up along Lake Erie east of Cleveland. Tour the covered bridges of Ashtabula County. Visit Clifton Gorge, John Bryan State Park, and Glen Helen in Yellow Springs. Eat the ice cream: Mitchell\u2019s, Jeni\u2019s, Toft\u2019s, Honey Hut, Tom\u2019s Ice Cream Bowl, and a zillion more all over the state. And definitely try the craft beer wherever you go if you\u2019re into that sort of thing! Ohio has fantastic craft beer.",

A fun, beautiful, playful little piece of an album. Its arias charm me into a daydream.\n\n1169 [**The Police** \u2013 *Ghost in the Machine*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHOevX4DlGk&amp;list=OLAK5uy_n1MxX3DzKitdBVqfxXrQhEx02KC54r06k) (UK, 1981, new wave / pop rock). \"Invisible Sun\" has intimations of *Synchronicity*. There is a definite sense across the tracks of this album of things that are to come on the next album: feelings of anxiety and pessimism.\n\n1170 [**Townes Van Zandt** \u2013 *Our Mother the Mountain*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFrn9VpXIrU&amp;list=OLAK5uy_k9ODTC2bgRXTn5bjzp-3X943b2tmDloj0) (USA, 1969, singer-songwriter / country / contemporary folk). The album is a velvet nightmare on a bed of nails, a lonely road to death on a mountainside, with carousing shame down in the valley.\n\n1171 [**The Oscar Peterson Trio** \u2013 *Night Train*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEPna_EwGgo&amp;list=OLAK5uy_ll_2ugM_Nsg--6LekvLF07zOWZn_I5F50) (USA, 1963, cool jazz). Tap your toe, have a drink and a quiet, pleasant conversation. At night. This is what I put on when my dinner guests say they wanna hear some \"jazz\".\n\n1172 [**Curtis Mayfield** \u2013 *Superfly*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJkjVfOcIxs&amp;list=PLX8ismU_sbV6terbOPGFP4R85E5eZijc2) (USA, 1972, film soundtrack / funk  / Chicago soul). I've yet to meet a person who doesn't like this album. Even when I was on a PHPBB forum back in the day, one old Irish dude recommended this album for our discussion club, and as far as I remember, this is the only pick that was unanimously liked. I mean, sad sacks who think The Smiths are great and cannot escape the absurdity and humiliation of their daily existence to metalheads who shit on everything, everyone loved this album. \"Pusherman\" pushes this music on your ears, and then you're hooked, mainlining falsetto funk.\n\n1173 [**RAIC** \u2013 *Multiplicity*](https://raic.bandcamp.com/album/multiplicity) (USA, 2019, avant-garde jazz). This one is all over the place, sometimes rubbing your back, sometimes kicking you in the nuts. Not sure which part I prefer...\n\n1174 [**EABS** \u2013 *Slavic Spirits*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUaOnIToakU&amp;list=OLAK5uy_nDc8bzdPgxyPCeIG-nrVvvGn_hdrNZKLw) (Poland, 2019, jazz fusion). Part of the band\u2019s purpose is to recognize where jazz came from but not adhere to the thought that the music must therefore continue to be rooted in the Western music market, which the ensemble members have criticized as being an increasingly generic industry. So a lot of these compositions are born of improv sessions focusing on the central European ideas of the Slavic witch and her rejection of, what we would now call, the patriarchy.\n\n1175 [**Fela Ransome Kuti &amp; Africa 70** \u2013 *Expensive Shit*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUNkimxj0Vo) (Nigeria, 1975, afrobeat). Way too short. You don't start a party like this and stop before even half an hour has passed. I feel like I should just link Fela Kuti's albums together and let them go. Rarely have I heard an artist whose first notes make me go \"oh yes, this is gonna be good\". And then he exceeds my expectation.\n\n1176 [**Richard Buckner** \u2013 *Surrounded*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVUOtniQy-A&amp;list=OLAK5uy_mkKJgS54a7_m_Q7gEo7DsRQnWcEb9WMzE) (USA, 2013, singer-songwriter). There's so much mystery in the heady folk phrasings of his guitar and his voice. This album has dark, tempestuous moments that make it perfect for a stormy night at home with a glass of wine and a thick pair of socks. Hell, just sit in the lean-to and enjoy this one.\n\n1177 John Zorn \u2013 The Book Beri\u2019ah (USA for composer / various countries for performers and arrangers, 2018, avant-garde jazz / klezmer / jazz-rock / nueva canci\u00f3n latinoamericana / brutal prog / jazz fusion / Arabic jazz / exotica / chamber jazz / avant-garde metal / experimental big band / progressive metal / experimental rock). Yeah. I\u2019m not posting up the links for each section of this massive compilation, but all the names and section titles are listed below, so go knock yourself out.\n\nOut of the 11 \"parts\" of this project, I have kept eight. Those three missing parts are just not my thing, but that's okay. It's not like I'm cutting tracks. I'm removing whole sections--pretty much albums--done by different artists. Anyway, this isn't an album. It's a compendium of music bound together like a massive tome. Obviously not something one is going to listen to in a single sitting. All this stuff is composed by John Zorn but performed by the following:\n\nSo, chapter one is *Keter*, a nueva canci\u00f3n latinoamericana and klezmer work by Sof\u00eda Rei &amp; JC Maillard. This is a strange and intoxicating mix of disparate influences blended expertly together. Sometimes a dance through a dream, sometimes an off-balanced tip-toeing, especially with the layered vocal sampling.\n\nChapter three, *Binah*, is experimental big band by Spike Orchestra. It has all the meandering, dirty brass joy you'd expect from that genre tag.\n\nChapter four is *Chesed*, free improvisation by Julian Lage &amp; Gyan Riley. Sophisticated, complicated acoustic guitar work that sometimes doesn't sound improvisational at all, but then the rulebook gets thrown out the window and everything breaks down so wonderfully.\n\nChapter six, *Tiferet*, is more klezmer, this time done by a Mexican band known as Klezmerson. The gypsy punk feeling of this mixed with some pronounced Latin rhythms doesn't fail to get me moving.\n\nChapter seven is *Netzach*, chamber jazz performed by Gnostic Trio. The vibraphone and harp are a wonderful combination, giving the music a dreamlike quality. There are some really beautiful shimmering guitar moments here. This is my favorite of the bunch.\n\nChapter eight is *Hod*, jazz-rock performed by Zion80. Zorn himself pops onto this album to play saxophone. This one feels like it's the most fun to have performed. A real party atmosphere. Amid all those heavy metal guitars the saxophone really sounds like it's crying for help, like it's been surrounded and cannot escape.\n\nChapter nine, *Yesod*, is a beautiful jazz-fusion garden of delights performed by Banquet of the Spirits. Their handling of the material is wild and tribal at times as well as embracing the serenity of open, minimal soundscapes. Wonderful.\n\nChapter ten is *Malkhut*, an experimental rock exploration by Secret Chiefs 3 with all the technical playfulness of an avant-prog romp. Sometimes this one has a kind of ineffable open-road feel to the guitars.\n\n1178 [**Ex Eye** \u2013 *Ex Eye*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aipg9gjEySc) (USA, 2017, avant-garde metal / progressive metal / post-metal). The echoing, ethereal jazz fusion moments are what really grab me on this album. It's like some clarion call appealing to something beyond what the guitars can reach. Without this strange exploration, this would just be another guitars-playing-at-acute-angles album.\n\n1179 [**T. Rex** \u2013 *The Slider Close*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfA6ucQE92k&amp;list=PLz6cAheObZchibGOwawEd3eG8msDvVF_s) (UK, 1972, glam rock). Close ups. Big lipstick lips. Glitter. Come hither looks. Baby baby baby fa la la la la. As sexy rocking as crooning. Not much more to say about the boyish charm of this sexy album.\n\n1180 [**Rodriguez** \u2013 *Cold Fact*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_-JhUNuc-c&amp;list=OLAK5uy_kJoM8fDbg2I5aywnlQNufWsFUEG-yX0ks) (USA, 1970, folk rock / singer-songwriter). He was birthed by the inner city. The dirty streets are his dam, the prostitute back alleys his mother. The symbolism of the album cover is no mistake: he's in his womb, and he's above the city. But the womb is one of his own making, the womb of his untouchable heart. He's wrapped himself in it like armor, protecting himself from...everything, and more importantly, from everyone. He sings of social problems, but they don't seem to affect him directly. He's outside looking in. He's in his calm bubble. He sings of what could be personal problems, but he doesn't really have any, since he eschews personal relationships.\n\n[Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/gm38g0/what_have_you_been_listening_to_week_of_may_18/fr2iucc/)",

        "*Around the globe, steel makers are coping with the pandemic by slashing capital spending.*\n\n*With sales in free fall, Europe\u2019s ArcelorMittal S.A. cut planned investments by US$800-million last week, a 25-per-cent trim, while United States Steel Corp. recently chopped $125-million out of its budget, a 14-per-cent reduction. Meanwhile, Japan\u2019s Kobe Steel Ltd. ratcheted down spending by a third.*\n\n*Alan Kestenbaum is taking the opposite approach at Stelco Holdings Inc., despite being chief executive of a business that\u2019s gone bust twice in the past two decades. He\u2019s hiked spending on the Hamilton-based company\u2019s facilities. In the midst of a global downturn, Mr. Kestenbaum decided to make a $110-million wager on a rebound in North American manufacturing and construction.*\n\n*If he\u2019s made the right call, Stelco will head into next year as North America\u2019s most efficient steel maker. If the 56-year-old CEO has got this wrong... Well, Stelco went into this crisis with the luxury of $232-million of cash, no debt and a balance sheet that analysts say is strong enough to weather the storm - even with the extra expenses.*\n\n*\u201cYou have to have the audacity to spend money at a time like this,\u201d Mr. Kestenbaum said in an interview from his home office in Miami. \u201cI understand the instinct to say \u2018let\u2019s be cautious, let\u2019s not spend money,' but we decided we had to spend on the things that really matter,\u201d said the Brooklyn-born son of a Wall Street commodities trader.*\n\n*Two things really mattered at Stelco when the COVID-19 crisis hit, beside keeping employees healthy. The first was the planned once-in-a-generation refurbishment of 35-year-old blast furnaces. The second was locking in a long-term supply of iron ore, a key raw material. Stelco\u2019s existing iron ore contract expires in 18 months. Completing the two projects is central to Mr. Kestenbaum\u2019s strategy of making Stelco a low-cost North American producer. The goal is a steel company able to make money during even the low points in the cycle of an industry known for its deep valleys.*\n\n*Rather than simply maintain its furnaces \u2013 a process known as relining \u2013 the CEO wanted to update them with the latest technology. Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, Stelco executives toured European and Asian steel mills and equipment manufacturers. They compiled a 13-point plan to dramatically upgrade Stelco\u2019s operations on Lake Erie, near Nanticoke, Ont., potentially adding 300,000 tons a year of steel-making capacity, a 13-per-cent increase in the company\u2019s overall production.*\n\n*When COVID-19 began shutting down North American manufacturing in March, Stelco had already sunk $35-million into the furnace upgrade. It will take another $85-million to complete the job. Mr. Kestenbaum said the company had three choices: postpone the work, do a low-risk partial upgrade or move forward with the whole job. The middle option would have cost just $30-million but only produced half the increase in capacity and would have needed to be revisited within five years. The CEO went for door number three, a decision rooted in three decades of building successful industrial companies on the back of someone else\u2019s mistakes.*\n\n*Mr. Kestenbaum started his career as a commodity trader at global mining company Glencore PLC, then struck out in his own in 1985. Bankrolled in part by his father-in-law, a former Wall Street executive, he founded a company called Marco International Inc. that shipped aluminum from producers in South America, Romania and Russia. Then he bought a second business out of bankruptcy, Globe Specialty Metals, and built it through the acquisition of a series of troubled companies before cashing in 2015 as part of a US$3.1-billion merger.*\n\n*The experience gave Mr. Kestenbaum an approach \u2013 avoid debt and be bold in tough times \u2013 that he brought to Stelco after his private equity firm, Bedrock Industries Group LLC, acquired the company out of creditor protection in 2017. It also gave the steel tycoon the cash needed to join one of the world\u2019s most exclusive clubs: He is part owner of the National Football League\u2019s Atlanta Falcons.*\n\n*To feed iron ore into those upgraded furnaces, Stelco used the current downturn to strike a US$600-million supply deal with U.S. Steel. The contract, announced at the end of April, locks in supply for eight years and gives Stelco the option of buying a 25-per-cent stake in a massive iron ore mine in Minnesota. Stelco put down just US$20-million to strike the deal. It owes another US$80-million over the next eight months, then US$500-million if it chooses to close the transaction next year.*\n\n*Stelco opted to go forward with the full furnace rebuild, a 75-day process scheduled to take place this fall, and sign the long-term iron ore deal partly because Mr. Kestenbaum is relentlessly optimistic and partly because Stelco customers are snapping up steel, despite the economic downturn. The CEO says a nimble sales force, largely working from home, found new clients in sectors such as construction when demand from traditional sectors such as auto making dried up in March.*\n\n*Stelco expects to operate at 100-per-cent capacity this quarter. Mr. Kestenbaum said employees moved swiftly to redesign work spaces, cafeterias and locker rooms to ensure they could work safely, but keep working. No Stelco employee is known to have contracted the novel coronavirus at work.*\n\n*Bank of Nova Scotia analyst Michael Doumet said despite all the economic headwinds, Stelco is projected to post $9-million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the current quarter. This, in a time when most steel makers will be losing money and idling facilities. \u201cWhile we acknowledge the name isn\u2019t for the faint of heart, we believe the shares offer an attractive risk/reward,\u201d Mr. Doumet said.*\n\n*Looking ahead, Mr. Kestenbaum is confident the political winds are blowing Stelco\u2019s way. The company was rocked by 25-per-cent tariffs that U.S. President Donald Trump slapped on Canadian steel and aluminum makers during recent trade negotiations. With those tariffs now history, Stelco\u2019s CEO said the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement holds the potential for greater demand from automakers, pipelines and appliance companies that need to use more North American-produced steel to meet government regulations. Mr. Kestenbaum said he also expects to see a renaissance in domestic manufacturing, as companies revisit global supply chains and outsourced operations in the wake of the pandemic.*",

        "AND:\n\nIn terms of prior civilizations, ironically, I am part of a team assembled as a set of computer, tectonic/vulcanology and archaeological experts who are asking the question of: \n\nFrom 65 million years ago to 500 million years ago GEOGRAPHICALLY and stratagraphic-wise, WHERE WOULD advanced ancient civilizations actually BUILD cities for us to discover in the strata?  Based upon our current research in the last 10 years, we have found 20 stratagraphic and geographic zones of likely habitation for such advanced civilizations. We are also modeling human oral and written histories to narrow down the scope of LIKELY time periods where certain civilizations did or would likely arise from geographically.\n\nWe are getting early indications via secretly obtained fossil evidence that dinosaur-like beings EVOLVED from their own reptilian ancestors and became advanced enough to become humanoidal in stature with hands, feet and large brains to eventually become spacefaring and FTL capable! We BELIEVE this to have occurred as early as the Permian era (300 to 250 million years ago!) WITH ANOTHER reptoidal civilization appearing mid-Cretacious from 125 million years ago to 90 million years ago!  We have already found evidence of what we believe are fossilized imprints of entire cities in the lower strata near what is today coastal Northern Chile AND just inside-of and off the east coast of Brazil.\n\nSee map of Pangea supercontinent:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangaea#/media/File:Snider-Pellegrini_Wegener_fossil_map.svg\n\nThe area that is coloured light orange is what we believe was relatively temperate to sub-tropical and would have been ideal for reptoid forms to evolve into semi-humanoidal forms unhindered by the larger more carnivorous dinosaurs.  We THINK a twin-set of large very high mountain ranges existed in that area cutting it off from the rest of the Pangea supercontinent environment and lowering the temperatures enough to allow for big-brained beings to evolve within a very large super-valley containing many rivers, lakes, plains and transition areas that seemed to be present between two large mountain ranges. Area wise we think the super-valley was about the size of Alberta and Saskatchewan combined but long and thin stretching from the coast to the interior of the Pangea supercontinent buffered in-between two high mountain ranges probably about the height of the Colorado Rockies (i.e. 10,000 to 14,000 feet high) that would have blocked the normally super-hot and humid outer environment from encroaching into the super-valley. It would have been temperate to sub-tropical in nature PERFECT for big-brained beings to evolve!\n\nWe THINK the overall evolution process would have been much longer than humans probably taking around 100+ million years to occur to pre-verbal/land dwelling levels and then another 25 million years to become technological and spacefaring.  This is likely due to a lower metabolism when compared to humans. The reptoids would have been slow acting compared to us so it took a LOOOOONG while to become technological.\n\nANOTHER SET of simian-being (i.e. ape-like humanoid) civilizations SEEM to have arisen to space-faring capability from 55 million years ago to 35 million years ago near what is today Patagonia and South Africa. We have found synthetic-seismic modeling evidence of large sub-surface solid structure imprints that are likely artificial (i.e. dams, buildings and even roadways). We suspect the local geographic environment SHELTERED these beings from the big post-dinosaur-era meat-eaters enough so that they could expand their population enough to become agricultural and technological!\n\nAND a final set of strata evidence of technological beings around 525 thousand to 350 thousand years ago in South India/Southwest Asia which may have been \"helped\" by \"Sponsors\".  The reason is that we have found strata evidence of nuclear warfare byproducts in various subsurface portions of India and South Asia where Zirconium and Cesium fission byproducts were found in subsurface soil samples where NO recent nuclear testing ever occurred AND glass fusion pellets occurred indicating nuclear detonations was present in strata that is around 525,000 to 350,000 years old!  We have a loose correlation that the environment in those areas was a more sheltered post-glacial temperate/mild-subtropical allowing large brained sentient beings to evolve for a long enough time period without being adversely affected by larger more-predatory animals. Again synthetic-seismic data indicated presence of solid structures such as dams, buildings, roadways, etc)\n\nALSO .... within the east side of the Rocky Mountains of North America, we have subsurface evidence of a large artificial lake about half the size of Lake Erie (around 120+ km long by 25 km wide) being present near what is today west and south of the City of Calgary out to the foothills indicating multiple lakeside metropolises. Recent glaciation post-350,000 years ago has moved the evidence of the bottom of the lake around but the strata evidence of large solid city structure imprints IS visible in certain subsurface strata locations with the Alberta foothills! This means BOTH the Alberta lakeside metropolises and the India/South Asia locations existed in the same time period from 525,000 to 350,000 years ago BEFORE the ILLINOIAN GLACIATION PERIOD but suddenly disappeared! (i.e. possibly due to warfare?) We believe the lake is artificial due to the large damming structure imprints found in subsurface scans. The actual dam structure itself would normally be ground into dust by glaciation BUT we would LIKELY find engineered metal or ceramic constructs in that area and evidence of engineered concrete-like till!\n\nWe are 3D-modeling the locations to give a general idea of WHERE the limits of the inhabited areas versus the artificial lake bounds are, but WE NOW BELIEVE we may be able to obtain uncrushed-by-glaciation metallic and ceramic fragments of pre-historical technology.  In the Late 1980's/Early 1990's I had heard of multiple Alberta water well drillers finding what they thought was home electronics and ceramic household junk at the bottom of their well holes ranging from 200 feet to 400 feet down. Normally the drillers would have thought it was a previous drilling operation or sub-surface mining operations from the 1950's-1970's so they tended to junk the items found. (they weren't too bright or simply didn't care about what they found!)\n\nOne Xerox copy of a photo of one such discovery NOW LOOKS LIKE TO ME a set of undamaged very large flash memory cards and ceramic coffee cups and uncorroded metal containers. (i.e. when a drill bit hits a snag or someone loses some monitoring gear down the drill hole, the drillers go \"Fishing\" and use pumps, water pressure, or actual lines/hooks to retrieve detritious that the drill bits snag on or can't get through! -- They also sometimes stick some dynamite/explosives down the hole to help the drill process go faster! --- AND SOMETIMES they retrieve some pretty interesting things from those drill holes!) and what was retrieved more than a few times in those Alberta Foothills IS VERY TECHNOLOGICAL IN NATURE !!! We have been trying to retrieve and examine the actual item samples shown on the Xerox photo copies from the parties involved in the original water well drillings AND when we finish the 3D modelling, we will be drilling and digging into the strata to find proper and verifiable evidence!\n\nWe also found fission products such as selenium and technetium within multiple sites in both India and the Middle East that indicate multiple recent nuclear detonations from 50,000 years to as recently as 35,000 years ago.... SOOOOOO it is evident that we humans are NOT the first to arise here on Earth and become technological!\n\nI hope that Helps!\n\nV",

        "I haven't heard too much on Mars artifacts or local near-space activities but I just haven't looked much at that specific topic though!\n\nIn terms of the Synthetic Seismic scans, we are talking about cities LARGER than Toronto and even Tokyo which contain sub-surface fossilized imprints of what we believe to be tracked roadways i.e. not designed for wheeled vehicles but it looks more like large concrete tracks for very wide guided rail travel systems similar to Skytrain or the Toronto Subway system but MUCH LARGER in width and height!\n\nI have also seen evidence of VERY LARGE DAMS similar to if not larger than China's MASSIVE Three-Gorges size! Of course, due to glaciation we would find mostly only pulverized dust BUT there may still be metallic or composite fibre reinforcement which we could drill for and obtain to study further.  We think the dams were only used for water containment and diversion since a spacefaring society would ALREADY HAVE access to powerful Fusion-like power production systems for transport and general citizen usage!\n\nWe also see evidence of what we believe to be office/living tower blocks that are in scale much larger than any modern building which we THINK were actually made of a composite fibre and NOT concrete material. THESE are our best bets for obtaining DEFINITIVE PROOF once we start drilling into the strata!  \n\nif we do an extrapolation using TODAY's building envelope designs for weight loads and typical volumes of steel, concrete and composite material construction, we can make a very general ballpark figure estimate of buildings at least twice the height of the Burj Khalifa in Dubai (world's tallest building as of 2020) with a base volume maybe ten times to 30 times the size of the Burj Khalifa which means these are HUGE structures requiring extreme levels of engineering (i.e. 4000 feet high at 750 feet by 750 feet in on teh X and Y axis!). That type of building could hold the equivalent of 250,000 people working and living in EACH building if we use common modern condominium-centric human living-space footprints as the base calculation example. (we saw MANY such building imprints!) \n\nIn terms of population, if these were humans of normal 1.5 to 2 meters tall at 150 to 300 lbs in weight, we are estimating for the West-of-Calgary artificial lake from before the Illinoian Glaciation, that there were about SIX major lake-side metropolises each with a possible population of up to 20 MILLION PEOPLE so that is 120 million+ persons in an area half the size of Lake Erie!  That's even more dense than TOKYO since the square areas we found were less than 15 km by 15 km or about the same size as the west coast city of Vancouver proper!  We think the population density was nearing Honk Kong or Manila levels per square km. These would have been VERY BUSY and very crowded cities!\n\nINTERESTINGLY, we find NO EVIDENCE of other sub-surface strata city imprinting ANYWHERE ELSE in Alberta, Saskatchewan or Manitoba, so we believe this was a specific locale for a highly-specific species that kept to only that southwest of modern-day Calgary location. We find the SAME fossilized imprinting of city-structures on the other side of the globe in India and Southwest Asia -- These may be competing societies or geographically-separated groups of the same society.\n\nIf we look at it from an anthropological viewpoint, this type of extreme localization only occurs in societies that are NOT NATIVE to a climate or land/sea region. Normally, a society expands to FILL the entire geographic location. If one keeps to a Fortress-like city construct, that does suppose and posit that this ancient society may NOT actually be native to Earth! They may have just built a few city-sized bases for whatever purpose required and then when done, much like a mining site, it simply gets abandoned, burned down or otherwise destroyed after they leave!  This kind of ties in with many ancient human legends where people from the stars came to Earth very long ago, stayed a while, interacted barely with the local humans and then left abruptly!\n\nWe are starting to get the impression these highly-localized cities were either stop-overs for further galactic exploration and/or transport hubs OR they may have been a mining colony for some sort of highly-specific material that was required for their civilization. \n\nIf these societies WERE already spacefaring, it is very likely they would already have the technology and power production systems (i.e. Fusion) be able to mine the asteroids or the gaseous planets for raw materials so SOMETHING very specific to a living planet was required. We think it was RAW genetic material likely used for medicinal purposes be it from plants ONLY available/growing here on Earth or actual living being genetic material (i.e. human tissue!) used for something like longevity extension or human/simian-compatible genetic heritage rebuilding purposes.\n\nAnyways, during our future drilling/mining operations WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIND actual fossilized bones or solid structures evidence at those strata depths to give us definitive proof! What WE PERSONALLY WANT TO FIND is some rock-encased flash memory still photo/video card which we can eventually decipher using electron beam-based microscopy of its internal memory storage cells so that an advanced computer search, compare and examination/reconstruction software can maybe get a copy of somebody's home or work video files which we could then watch to our heart's delight! THAT WOULD BE IDEAL !!!\n\nWe should also LIKELY find evidence of small-sized home/work/societal detritous and even garbage such as the equivalent of ceramic coffee cups, plates, containers, electronics and other gear embedded or encased in solid rock formations that would inhibit sub-surface strata weathering, corrosion and crushing by glaciation or tectonic movements. THAT is our hope!\n\nFIRST, we have to 3D-XYZ map it all on a computer and then get proper Alberta mining/drilling permits and other financial and political issues in place first before we do our first sub-surface strata explorations!\n\nMaybe another five years is our best estimate for a first drilling program to start!\n\n---\n\nI don't know anything else about Venus, Mars, the Asteroids, etc as bases for current or ancient spacefaring beings! BUT I also didn't look or ask either!\n\nIn terms of visit/asylum requests, THAT i can tell you is a definite NO !!! You need to be INVITED / SPONSORED to a Dyson Shell !!!\n\nYou might also get \"kidnapped/abducted\" and taken for a ride to one once in a tiny while but that seems to be VERY RARE as far as I can tell!  \n\nIn terms of close-by-Earth-civilizations, the outer leading edge of each arm in this galaxy are rife with primitive and close-to-Earth-human levels of technological civilizations. It has been indicated to me that we are looking at HUNDREDS just in this Arm of Orion alone! BUT again, only a TINY FEW are space-faring or even ahead of Earth itself in technology!  I am going to suggest only TEN to TWENTY of the Arm of Orion civilizations have the ability to travel within or just beyond their own solar system!  All the super-advanced beings are already in a Dyson Shell!  To find a multi-planetary-based FTL spacefaring civilization that is a Type 1.5 on the Kardashev scale (i.e. similar to the fictional Star Wars Universe), we are going to have to go outside of the LOCAL GROUP of galaxies.\n\nStart looking here:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephan%27s_Quintet\n\nand here \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert%27s_Quartet\n\nfor the Type 1.5 civilizations with FTL or low-distance hyperjump capability!\n\n\nV",

To man the blockade, Britain pressed American merchant sailors into the Royal Navy. American sentiment grew increasingly hostile toward Britain due to incidents such as the Chesapeake\u2013Leopard affair, which happened five years before the war. The British were in turn outraged by the Little Belt affair in 1811, in which 11 British sailors died.[9][10] Britain supplied arms to American Indians who raided American settlers on the frontier, hindering American expansion and provoking resentment.[11] Historians debate whether the desire to annex some or all of British North America (Canada) contributed to the American decision to go to war. However, the Western interest was in expansion into American territories such as Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin, where they were threatened by Indians supported by the British. On June 18, 1812, President James Madison signed into law the American declaration of war, after heavy pressure from the War Hawks in Congress.[12]\n\nWith most of its army in Europe fighting Napoleon, Britain adopted a defensive strategy, with offensive operations initially limited to the border and the western frontier along with help from Native American allies. American prosecution of the war effort suffered from its unpopularity, especially in New England, where it was referred to as \"Mr. Madison's War\". American defeats at the Siege of Detroit and the Battle of Queenston Heights thwarted attempts to seize Upper Canada, improving British morale. American attempts also failed to invade Lower Canada and capture Montreal. In 1813, the Americans won the Battle of Lake Erie, gaining control of the lake, and they defeated Tecumseh's Confederacy at the Battle of the Thames, defeating the largest Native ally of Britain and securing a primary war goal. The Americans made a final attempt to invade Canada but fought to a draw at the Battle of Lundy's Lane during the summer of 1814. At sea, the powerful Royal Navy blockaded American ports, cutting off trade and allowing the British to raid the coast at will. In 1814, one of these raids burned the capital, but the Americans later repulsed British attempts to invade New York and Maryland, ending invasions from Canada into the northern and mid-Atlantic states. In early 1815, the Americans decisively defeated the invading British Army attacking New Orleans, Louisiana. Fighting also took place in Spanish Florida; a two-day battle for the city of Pensacola ended in Spanish surrender.[13]\n\nIn Britain, there was mounting opposition to wartime taxation, and merchants demanded to reopen trade with America. With the abdication of Napoleon, Britain's war with France ended and Britain ceased impressment generally. This made moot the issue of American sailor impressment, and removed one of the original causes of the war. The British were then able to increase the strength of their blockade of the United States coast. Attempts to smother American maritime trade failed, however, at which point both sides began to desire",

        "With false \"data\" from models, that's what the falsified datasets will say.  The actual temperatures on the ground were higher in the 1930s.\n\nThe Great Heat Wave of 1936; Hottest Summer in U.S. on Record\n\nBy: Christopher C. Burt, 10:10 PM GMT on July 21, 2011\nThe Great Heat Wave of 1936; Hottest Summer in U.S. on Record\n\nAs the eastern two-thirds of the United States continues to swelter under some of the hottest temperatures seen in recent years I thought it opportune to look back at the nation\u2019s worst heat wave and hottest summer in history, that of 1936.\n\n1936; A Year of Extremes\n\nThe climatological summer (June-August) of 1936 was the warmest nationwide on record (since 1895) with an average temperature of 74.6\u00b0 (2nd warmest summer was that of 2006 with an average of 74.4\u00b0) and July of 1936 was the single warmest month ever measured with an average of 77.4\u00b0 (beating out July 2006 by .1\u00b0). Ironically, February of 1936 was the coldest such on record with an average nationwide temperature of 26.0\u00b0 (single coldest month on record was January 1977 with a 23.6\u00b0 average). In February of 1936 temperatures fell as low as -60\u00b0 in North Dakota, an all-time state record and Turtle Lake, North Dakota averaged -19.4\u00b0 for the entire month, the coldest average monthly temperature ever recorded in the United States outside of Alaska. One town in North Dakota, Langdon, went for 41 consecutive days below zero (from January 11 to February 20), the longest stretch of below zero (including maximum temperatures) ever endured at any site in the lower 48.\n\nWith this in mind, it is truly astonishing what occurred the following summer. The temperature in North Dakota that had reached -60\u00b0 on February 15 at Parshall rose to 121\u00b0 at Steele by July 6, 1936. The two towns are just 110 miles from one another!\n\nThe Great Heat Wave\n\nJUNE 1936\n\nJune of 1936 saw unusual heat build initially in two nodes, one centered over the Southeast and another over the Rocky Mountains and western Plains. This differs from the current heat wave that began mostly over Texas and the Deep South.\n\n\n\nBy the end of June 1936 all-time state monthly records for heat had been established in Arkansas (113\u00b0 at Corning on June 20th), Indiana (111\u00b0 at Seymore on June 29th), Kentucky (110\u00b0 at St. John on June 29th), Louisiana (110\u00b0 at Dodson on June 20th), Mississippi (111\u00b0 at Greenwood on June 20th), Missouri (112\u00b0 at Doniphan on June 20th), Nebraska (114\u00b0 at Franklin on June 26th), and Tennessee (110\u00b0 at Etowah on June 29th). A total of 8 states and all these monthly records are still standing.\n\nJULY 1936\n\nBy July the dome of heat locked in place over the central and northern Great Plains and remained there for the entire month.\n\n\n\nAround July 8-10 the ridge briefly extended all the way to the East Coast when virtually every absolute maximum temperature record was broken from Virginia to New York. This held true for most sites in the Ohio Valley, Upper Midwest, and Great Plains as well. There are so many superlatives that it is impossible to list them all. In short the following states broke or tied their all-time maximum temperatures that July:\n\n\n\nAdd to the above list a 120\u00b0 reading at Gann Valley, South Dakota on July 5th. Unfortunately I am unable to update the table with this record since it would involve rewriting and posting the table (not an easy task!). Sorry for the omission!\n\nSome of the many major cities to record their all-time maximum temperatures during July 1936 included:\n\n\n\nOn July 15th the average high temperature for all 113 weather stations in Iowa measured 108.7\u00b0. Similar to the current heat wave the nighttime low temperatures were also remarkably warm. Bismarck recorded a low of just 83\u00b0 on July 11th. Milwaukee, Wisconsin endured five consecutive nights above 80\u00b0 from July 8-13. Even near the normally cool shores of Lake Erie amazing temperatures were recorded such as the low of 85\u00b0 and high of 110\u00b0 at Corry, Pennsylvania on July 14th. And most amazing of all was the low of 91\u00b0 at Lincoln, Nebraska on the night of July 24-25th warming to an all-time record of 115\u00b0 on the 25th.\n\n\n\nResidents of Lincoln, Nebraska spend the night on the lawn of the state capital on July 25, 1936. The temperature that night never fell below 91\u00b0, perhaps the warmest night ever recorded anywhere in the United States outside of the desert Southwest. Photo from the Nebraska State Historical Society.\n\nAUGUST 1936\n\nBy August the heat dome shifted a bit further south from its position over the northern Plains and became anchored over the southern Plains.\n\n\n\nMore all-time state records were broken or tied:\n\n\n\nOklahoma City also broke its all-time heat record with a high of 113\u00b0 on August 11th as did Kansas City also with 113\u00b0 on August 14th and Wichita with 114\u00b0 on the 12th. The list just goes on and on.\n\nAll in all, nothing like this heat wave has before or since occurred. It is hard to believe how people fared without air-conditioning, although there were some rudimentary forms of such:\n\n\n\nWhen the temperature peaked at an all-time high of 108\u00b0 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the want-ad staff at the 'St. Paul Daily News' was provided with 400 pounds of ice and two electric fans to cool the air in the press room. Photo from the Minnesota Historical Society.\n\nThe only saving grace was that, unlike the current heat wave, humidities were low as a result of the ongoing and prolonged drought which had been affecting almost all of the central part of the country for several years come the summer of 1936. This is also probably one of the reasons that such anomalous extreme high temperatures were recorded.\n\nSeventeen states broke or equaled their all-time record absolute maximum temperatures during the summer of 1936 (still standing records).\n\nBelow is a map reproduced from my book Extreme Weather: A Guide and Record Book that summarizes some of the records broken during the summer of 1936:\nhttp://icons.wxug.com/hurricane/chrisburt/1936map2.jpg",

        "I bet you thought I'd write less with Staubach retired... so did I, this monstrosity just sort of happened.\n\nIn the actual voting, the 1980 MVP race turned into a two-horse contest between Brian Sipe and Earl Campbell, which is a little disappointing to me because the contest for best quarterback of the season is so interesting. There are three reasonable contenders, Sipe, Fouts, and Philly's Ron Jaworski. We'll start with the numbers. Key at the end of the post, as usual.\n\nQB|Dropbacks|ANYA|PYAE|Rush|Adj. Rush Yards|RYAE|Fumbles|TYAE|YAE/touch|Schedule|HoF Teammates|Est. DVOA\n:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:\nJaworski|478|6.94|994.24|27|115|7|6|866.24|1.72|-0.4|1|35.6\nSipe|577|6.73|1078.99|20|75|-5|3|1006.49|1.69|-1.1|2|31.6\nFouts|621|6.48|1006.02|23|55|-37|11|721.52|1.12|0.4|2|33.9\n\n1980 was the year of the tiebreaker. All five(!) AFC playoff teams finished at 11-5, with the seeding being determined entirely by tiebreakers... and the NFC tiebreaker situation was even screwier, but we'll get to that. It feels like it had an impact on the race, to me. Does Brian Sipe still win \"the quarterback primary\" handily if the Browns are the second wild card and Fouts has homefield?\n\nI any event, Brian Sipe had the narrative advantage. He joined forces with coach Sam Rutigliano, the \"Pied Piper of Lake Erie\", to end Cleveland's team record seven year playoff drought (times have changed, haven't they?) by winning the AFC Central over Houston and Pittsburgh, which had met each other in the previous two AFC title games - which was *before* the Oilers added Ken Stabler. He did it by tying for the league lead in fourth quarter comebacks with four (he tied with Steve Bartkowski, probably explaining the latter's MVP votes on a statistically good-but-not-great season), leading the media to dub the Browns the \"Kardiac Kids\". His statistical case was very good as well, as you can see.\n\nWhatever magic the Browns had captured died with the calendar year of 1980. On January 4th, their season ended with Red Right 88, and Sipe faded back into the pack of NFL QBs afterward. The most interesting thing (and the unique thing; he'd had big touchdown totals and high YPA before) about Sipe's stat line is his low interception rate. Interceptions are high impact and notoriously \"swingy\" year to year; His career average interception rate was 4.3%, and the second best for his career was 3.8%. During the 1980 regular season he got that down to 2.5%, but their one playoff game was a three-pick fiasco, including the killer, a forced pass into the end zone in the last minute, in easy field goal range, down by two. My read on Sipe '80 is that he was a gambler who kept rolling sevens; I would be fascinated to see if he had 8 to 10 or so more dropped interceptions than normal.\n\nRon Jaworski's Eagles already had the most talented roster in the NFC in 1979 but got kicked to the wildcard round as they were out-coached and out-quarterbacked by Landry &amp; Staubach. In 1980, Jaworski stepped forward into the one-year interregnum between Staubach and Montana and for one brief season was the best quarterback in the conference. Combined with one of the NFL's elite defenses, it's no surprise Jaworski led the Eagles to the top of the NFC without having to rally every other week like his AFC counterpart. Philadelphia was 11-1 on Thanksgiving, two games clear of Dallas for both the East title and homefield. Then the ship hit a rock, and going into the season finale the Cowboys were back within a game and set to host the Eagles. Still, there was no cause to panic at kickoff; all Philly had to do was not lose by 24. Cause to panic arrived when Danny White hit his 4th TD pass of the day to give the Cowboys a 35-10 lead early in the 4th quarter. The stage was set for the most unusual comeback in NFL history, as Jaworski led the Eagles to two fourth quarter touchdowns and the NFC East title - to this day, the only ever 4th quarter rally ending in a two score loss that can be considered a total success.\n\nLike Sipe, things went wrong for Jaworski as soon as the regular season ended. He went 17 for 38 and was intercepted twice in the divisional round, but the Eagles won easily as their defense got five picks off Tommy Kramer. Jaworski was more or less useless in round three against Dallas (9 for 29, two picks), but again the Eagles won handily as their running game paved over the aging Doomsday Defense and neither White nor Dorsett could get anything going. In the Super Bowl, Jaworski melted down *again*, going 18-for-38 with three picks. The defense was unable to bail him out a third time; Jim Plunkett tore them to shreds. Jaworski spent the rest of his playing career as a league average starter, then had a good run as a TV analyst.\n\nStatistically, Jaworski (**very** marginally) eked out the top spot ahead of Sipe in terms of efficiency. He didn't throw nearly as many passes, but he clearly didn't need to. Whether that should be held against him is an interesting philosophical question. What went right for Jaworski in 1980 isn't as clear to me as it is with Sipe. Jaworski's interception rate was better than his standard, but not as dramatically as Sipe's - it wasn't a career best, and was only a modest improvement on 1979.\n\nDan Fouts' season doesn't make as dramatic a story as Sipe's or Jaworski's; the basics were pretty simple. Coach Don Coryell liked to throw the ball - a contemporary media guy observed \"His idea of a running game is for three receivers to run for the goal line while Dan Fouts runs back to pass\" - so he built himself a passing game around QB Dan Fouts (Hall of Fame), WR Charlie Joiner (also Hall of Fame), TE Kellen Winslow (also Hall of Fame), and WR John Jefferson (Not in Canton, but twice All-Pro)^1, and then he wrecked teams with it. In an era when 3,000 yards was still considered the benchmark for good QB play, \"Air Coryell\" had three 1,100+ yard receivers. They took the passing yardage record, which they had set themselves the previous year, and shattered it by more than 600 yards. Statistically, what hurt Fouts relative to Sipe and Jaworski was turnovers, with twenty-four picks and eleven fumbles. For that era and that many dropbacks those numbers aren't actually bad, but it's far short of what Sipe and Jaworski did. The other knock against Fouts is his stacked offense, which begs the question: How stacked was it, really?\n\nJohn Jefferson left after 1980, at the prime age of 25, to join Lynn Dickey in Green Bay. He accomplished approximately nothing, was a backup by 29, and was out of the league at 30. Without him the Chargers actually somehow found yet *another* gear. Charlie Joiner was a journeyman who'd never had a 40 catch season until joining up with Fouts at age 29; he's in the Hall of Fame based on what he did in his 30s (and he wasn't playing with trash QBs before either, he spent his prime years on Ken Anderson's Bengals at the height of Anderson's powers). Kellen Winslow spent his while career with Fouts; possibly a clever move, given his effect on the wideouts! Just to complete the narrative, Fouts played well in the playoffs, advancing to the conference title game before losing a 34-27 shootout with the Raiders. \n\nI don't have much to say about the other QB who got votes - Atlanta's Steve Bartkowski - as while he was good he was a substantial step behind the big three and the votes were pretty clearly narrative driven. I do find it interesting that, like the Browns, the Falcons lived by the comeback all season and promptly died by it in the playoffs, although in a completely different fashion. Where the Browns failed a 4QC opportunity, the Falcons, a 12-4 second seed, blew a 14 point 4th quarter lead to the Cowboys.\n\nAny of the three is a fine choice, but for me Dan Fouts is the \"open field\" MVP of 1980. He proved he could do it before and he proved he could do it again, where Sipe and Jaworski came from nowhere and vanished just as quickly, while his team was stacked there are good reasons to think it maybe wasn't as stacked as it looks, and he played the toughest schedule of the contenders.\n\n**Key**\n\n- Dropbacks : Passes + Sacks.\n\n- ANYA : Conventional measure of passing efficiency.\n\n- PYAE : Dropbacks*(ANYA - League average ANYA).\n\n- Rush : Number of rushes; unfortunately, I have no way to filter kneeldowns here on in yardage.\n\n- Adj.

        "BOSTON COLLEGE OFFERS BRANDON MILLER (#11 OVERALL, #1 PENNSYLVANIA, #3 FC)\n\n\nSCHOLARSHIP\n\n________________\n\nSome coaches simply don\u2019t have the longest of resumes when it comes to players who were sent pro. When they join a school that has only ever sent a handful of players, it\u2019s hard to make that values judgement, but I respect that. I\u2019ve been there too, worked up from the bottom, sending players to the NBL who, when they first entered college, other things were their priority.\n\nOther coaches are, arguably, worse. They\u2019ll talk trash about their fellow coaches who have these unassuming resumes, but masquerade as the sole force of their program. They\u2019ll claim other coaches' successes, coaches that have since moved on to different projects and aren\u2019t associated with their old programs in any way. They\u2019ll take credit for the work that was done while they weren\u2019t even unattached to the program, but rather attached to a *completely different program in the country.*\n\nThe latter is inexcusable, in my opinion. The institutional knowledge just isn\u2019t there anymore, the assistant coaches have long since left, and, while I understand what it\u2019s like to work with a less than stellar history, I didn\u2019t try to pass off my predecessors accomplishments as my own. I worked to build this program, to build a system that became renowned over time. I didn\u2019t take a short cut.\n\nThat has led to this program: The Boston College Golden Eagles. It is, perhaps, one of the strongest destinations for any player, but is unequivocally head and shoulders above any other program in the country when it comes to sending a FC to the NBL, and guaranteeing they stay there.\n\nThis is a program that has had forty-five alums go to the NBL, an astounding number, but only the first of many that will shock you. 17 of those players are *currently* playing in the NBL, and twelve of them are on their second, third, or fourth contracts. Zero Boston College alums are on a minimum deal, with our *lowest* paid non-rookie pulling in nearly ten million dollars a year.\n\nBut, just when it seems too good to be true, I want you to listen to the kind of players we have sent. See, while even pitching Boston College\u2019s least successful pros makes the other schools wilt before us, Boston College is more that. I\u2019m not going to waste your time by harping on about UDFAs that signed for a paltry second deal. You\u2019re better than that.\n\nWe\u2019re the school that has sent *twenty-four* players in your position to the NBL. Even in your archetype we\u2019ve sent players just like you - athletic, floor stretching bigs that can shoot from anywhere - to the pro in the last *few years*, like Alvin Crawford, the stretch big in Boston this year on a 10M$ deal. Meanwhile, I am \u201cone of the few that can match\u201d Irish\u2019s successes of sending bigs to the draft; and top it, with Vernon Carey III, Jamie Mutombu, and BJ Melville all first round picks in the last few seasons.\n\nOr, we could talk about players like Roger Moore, who translated a nineteenth overall pick in Chicago into a 19.5 million dollar deal. Or BJ Melville, the big from Brooklyn who was drafted 20th overall and went to Indiana for 15M per year. Players deep from our history, like Anthony Miller who had three contracts with the Lakers and Brad Kinder who played in the ATL for a decade, or players that are\u2026 perhaps\u2026 more starry. This year Stephen Wilder signed a 5 year, 143 million dollar renewal with the team he was drafted with. Alone, he has generated more than a quarter billion dollars, but he only represents a portion of the more than 400M$ BC players signed in renewals this year and the more than $2B they\u2019ve generated overall.\n\nSee, this is big country. This is where bigs come when they want to have a *career* in the NBL, not when they want to go undrafted and luck out.\n\nI know this because my history is more than just unblemished, it is exemplary. I\u2019ve done more than promise that I\u2019ll be here until the end of your NCBCA career, I\u2019ve promised that I\u2019d be at Boston College for players\u2019 entire *basketball* careers, and I\u2019m prepared to make the same promise to you right now. Much like I promised players who started here twenty, nearly thirty years ago, I promise that when you retire from your inevitably stellar career in the NBL, I will still be here, coaching the next generation at Boston College. I\u2019ve been here for players, and then, when they came for their kids freshmen seasons, I was the first to greet them at Logan.\n\nI too have never cut a scholarship player, never broken contract, but these things are trivial in the grand scheme of proving loyalty. When offered a chance to jump to my alma mater, I refused, and I\u2019ve built a career here over the last twenty-seven years - the only prominent one-team coach not associated with his alma mater.\n\nAnd, you know, if I was in Oklahoma, I too would pitch the OKC Plunde, I mean Thunder. It\u2019s not like there\u2019s anything better to do in a town that had to steal an NBL team. Boston, on the other hand, is different. This is a city with culture that oozes out of the cobblestone alleyways of Beacon Hill, with 1300 acres of urban parks instead of 4300 acres of \u201cflat\u201d, the most storied franchises in the country with the Bruins, Celtics, Red Sox, Revolution, and the Patriots, and one of the strongest party cultures in the country, with a strong mix of Irish catholicism and 100 000 students within the city.\n\nYou\u2019ll have opportunities like running a show on WZBC - the student run radio station that broadcasts to all of New England, or living in our pristine dorms, which our students find so excellent that 90% of Seniors live on campus. You\u2019ll find various cultural clubs, as well as activities like the Boston College sailing club, where you can learn to sail for free and take those skills back home to Lake Erie.\n\nThis is the best school for you. You\u2019ll be given the opportunity to play twenty, twenty-five minutes a game here for a coach that has a peerless history in rotating bigs to play strong minutes, at the best school for bigs in the country, and at a school where you\u2019ll be the favorite to win the Natty instantly.\n\nSo let\u2019s make your trip to the NBL a reality, huh?",

Evidently, these aliens knew a LOT about human physiology in order to use a PCM-based (Pulse Coded Modulation) of the human nervous system to induce auditory responses (i.e. voices in her mind!) \n\nThat DOES predispose that those aliens have been around on Earth for quite a bit longer on this \"exploration trip\" than just a mere few weeks! I would guess it's been hundreds if not THOUSANDS of years due to comments by them acknowledging OTHER alien groups on Earth AND acknowledging their own material longevity! I can actually make a definitive statement that too many alien hands are ACTIVELY in the Earth's political and societal pie. There are so many competing and cooperating alien groups that actual disclosure WILL be either fully deliberate by non-state or secretive agency actors or it will be an accidental disclosure caused by some local-yokel hunters with some dead alien bodies and pieces of a UFO tied to their pickup truck beds!\n\n----\n\nSynthetic Seismic surveys using acoustic waves allows us to view differences in density between layers of strata and see when there are HARD BOUNDARIES between artificial structures made out of dense solid materials such as metal block or metal-or-fibre reinforced concrete and areas composed of softer rocks such as sedimentary deposits. When we see 750 by 750 feet SQUARE imprints of support bases that are high density vs low density WE KNOW that is an artificial structure (i.e. the solid concrete block and under-pillars ARE STILL INTACT after 650,000 years (excepting for the typical lateral and uplift movement of strata during tectonic activity and glacial action which we can take into account when we do our 3D models!)\n\nYou ONLY SEE the ancient structures when you turn the Synthetic Seismic data into an actual 3D model which is where you see obvious artificiality!\n\nUsing Peizo-Electro-Mechanical Strata Strain Measurement sees material composition differences so that we can ESTIMATE whether the material we are looking at is fibre/rebar filled concrete, an igneous or sedimentary rock or metallic ore or seam and various combinations thereof. Electrical Current transmission/absorption capabilities and the peizo-electric nature of much strata lets us 3D map which materials EMIT electrical current and/or ABSORB/propagate fast-pulsed and slow-pulsed electrical signals. Normally this ONLY USED for very shallow strata measurements (usually used for coal bed seam finding and quartzite deposit mapping to find diamonds and gold)  BUT recent advances in DSP (Digital Signal Processing) allows us to map deep into the Earth into the many kilometers range now!  And NO we don't shock people using high current pulses. Only medium voltage adequately guarded test areas and safety-conscious/well-geared personnel are used to pulse survey into the upper and lower strata layers!\n\nThe 3D maps we found of the BASE concrete structures indicate Mechanical Support for a TOWER and using simple math for MODERN metal rebar and fibre reinforced concrete AND steel beam construction techniques allows us to ESTIMATE to a reasonable certainty their weight-bearing loads and determine WHAT THE LIKELY final height of said tower originally was. All the estimates came to between 3000 to 4000+ feet high which is GARGANTUAN in size with enough room for up to 250,000 people. We are pretty sure NONE of the concrete bases we saw were for pyramids but rather were actual weight-bearing bases for large commercial/living space tower blocks!\n\nAnd the sheer numbers of them organized as a GRID indicated a LARGE CITY from 5 million up to 20 million persons in size with an upper estimate to as much as 60+ million persons depending upon the AVERAGE user-footprint estimates we take into account on a cultural basis (i.e. was it the Population density of Vancouver (fairly low) or it is LA/San Francisco-size (medium) or Hong Kong/Manila (i.e. very high population density). And since we can now ESTIMATE that the beings seemed to be larger than many modern humans into the 1.8 to 2.0 to 2.5 meter range in height due to strata analysis of POSSIBLE CEILING HEIGHTS in actual building imprints, we can estimate end-user commercial and living-space footprint when compared to MODERN HUMAN populations.\n\nErgo, we got a very high population 120 million+ population count to as much as 300 million people (i.e. the uppermost estimate!) organized in multiple shoreline cities surrounding an artificially created fresh water lake (i.e. held by major dams in both the south and north) in an area half the size of Lake Erie located to the west and south of Calgary, Alberta, Canada! --- From a environmental standpoint this would be an IDEAL LOCATION climate-wise to set up such large cities. From 650,000 to 800,000 years ago, our climate had a Low CO2 count (180 to 260 PPM) temperate mountain conifer forest, just a tad colder than today very much like what the northern rocky mountains parts are like today but with heavier snowpacks.  It would have been much like Winter and Mid spring Jasper and Banff is today but all year round. The large fresh water lake would have tempered the normally WILD Alberta Foothills temperature swings and average temperatures would have been -15 C to +5 C in Winter to about +15 C to +25 C in Summer. They would NOT have had the bone-chilling -45 C that Alberta sometimes gets today.\n\nThat in my opinion is an IDEAL CLIMATE to be living and working in -- Very predictable and comfortable with all four seasons in place (a pronounced but consistent year-after-year round of well-defined winter, spring, summer and fall seasons). The rocky mountains to the East of the lake would have been a buffer allowing for the warming Chinook winds to occur even in winter and the lake would have moderated the bone-chilling North/South Arctic winds. You would have LIKELY had Lake Effect Snows giving winter a truly Winter-Wonderland look.\n\nAND knowing what modern societies do as social activities, we were ACTIVELY LOOKING for evidence of LIKELY localized Winter/Summer Resort locations along with their likely mountain clearing infrastructures and we believe we have found MULTIPLE such areas where strata DID NOT HAVE evidence of conifer forest fossilization compared to other local locations (i.e. the land was fully cleared at certain strata depths indicating a large ski/snowboard/hiking hill perhaps?) AND we found small numbers of large base blocks for towers in areas WITHIN the valleys of the Eastern Rockies PROBABLY indicating a mountain retreat/small town living area???\n\nWe can GUESS using computer animation of what we THINK are the actual strata movement, glaciation and till movement patterns happening over the last one million years and we found what WE THINK are the equivalent to modern day Whistler/Blackcomb mountain resorts hooked up to the lakeside cities via the remnants of a VERY LARGE concrete guideway rapid transit system that puts every modern subway to shame! We are talking \"Rail Cars\" PROBABLY the size of 4000 square-foot HOUSES being PROBABLY moved about on magnetic levitation rail systems. WE ARE GUESSING it was above-ground rather than fully underground PROBABLY for aesthetic/tourist view purposes.\n\nBecause of the high population count estimates we have made, we believe we are looking at mountain resorts TEN TIMES the size of Whistler/Blackcomb with a population around 500,000 up to two million people! It would have been Whistler/Blackcomb/Aspen/Vail on Steroids! When we do the final drilling/mining, we can be much more sure of what we have espoused earlier to be the LIKELY social and physical configuration of that 650,000 to 800,000 year old Western Alberta lake-side society!\n\nWe are PRETTY SURE they are NOT an Earth-native society! They came here from OUT THERE FOR A REASON! We do NOT KNOW that reason --- BUT --- We will find out soon enough!\n\nAND there was also a correspondingly-sized super-city within the borders of the Indian sub-continent and East Asia (i.e. near modern Kashmir/Eastern China districts) which we found due to what we believe is evidence of ancient Nuclear Detonation byproducts in the strata! (By the way, that Kashmir/Eastern China region was a nightmare situation to secretively fund and low-key-visit and get-into for synthetic seismic work!) It too had a large lake (probably artificially created!) due to the TYPES of strata deposits and shoreline configurations found! And it too likely had a conifer-forested temperate climate 650,000 to 800,000 years ago!\n\nThat basically begs the question of were the two societies AT WAR? What caused/precipitated the war OR was the evidence of nuclear detonation byproducts simply a demolition to remove evidence of a city before leaving back towards the stars, being kinda like what modern mining companies do when they destroy/demolish a local mining city before finally leaving once they have finished their economic activities!",

        "Note: I am not an expert on Chernobyl, nuclear energy, the Cold War, emergency response, or pretty much anything. Just a person with a little too much time on their hands and Wikipedia. \n\nIf a Chernobyl-esque incident happened in rural Ohio, assuming basically the same style of reactor, lax response, cover-up, etc. I think it could end up with just as if not more deaths. According to current data (because I'm lazy and don't want to find stats from the mid-80s) modern Ohio has a greater population density than modern Ukraine. According to Wikipedia, there are currently 3 operation nuclear power plants in the state, one near Toledo and the border with Michigan, one along Lake Erie nearish to Pennsylvania, and the third along the Ohio River border with Kentucky. Random number generator gave me a three so I'm gonna look at the [William H. Zimmer Power Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_H._Zimmer_Power_Station). \n\nAgain, according to the god Wikipedia, a 30km/19mi exclusion zone was eventually evacuated around Chernobyl. Assuming a similar response at the Zimmer station, this exclusion zone would extend to the suburbs of Cincinnati, including much of the city of Covington, KY, which has a population of 40,000. For an incident like this to occur so close to a major American city, any cover-up is going to be paper-thin and pretty obvious. The Ohio and US federal government would get reamed both locally, nationally, and internationally for having lax regulations and covering it up. Depending on where the wind was blowing the resulting radiation could be blown to any number of major American cities. Much of Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana would see contamination, with the major cities of Columbus, OH, Louisville, KY, and Indianapolis, IN seeing the most acute effects. If the wind was blowing north it could all over southern Canada. \n\nDue to the freer media of the US, the news of this would be much more widespread much sooner than in Chernobyl. This is a propaganda coup for the Soviet Union, as they can now shout from the roofs about what happens when capitalists are more concerned for profit than creating safe sources of energy for their people. They might even go so far as to make very public offers of aid and support for affected American workers. Other western nations condemn the US government for not being more open with what was going on, but I imagine they wouldn't go too far for risk of alienating the US. Reagan is likely not as beloved by conservatives as he currently is, given his participation in cover-ups. American leftists have an additional reason to despise the man. Bush the First probably loses the '88 election due to his connection to Reagan. Mainstream American liberals probably adopt a clean energy platform/environmentalist rhetoric earlier than they would otherwise. \n\nThe effects this would have on the perception of nuclear energy by the public is going to be magnified. Support for nuclear energy will be seen as toxic by many politicians, with most moving to phase out nuclear energy in the US and numerous other countries. Initially, this would lead to a rise in coal plants and probably earlier exploration of fracking in the US. Given the larger amounts of deaths associated with coal as an energy source vs nuclear, this would likely result in a greater amount of deaths due to lung cancers and things like that. Possibly this is recognized by the rising environmental movement, who push to move away from fossil/non-renewables altogether in favor of wind and solar. Opposition to nuclear weapons would absolutely rise and arms limitation treaties between nuclear powers would likely happen earlier and be stronger. \n\nThis would definitely not bode well demographically for the region. Due to deindustrialization and white flight, major cities in the area were already losing a significant amount of people. [From 1970 to 1980](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati), Cincinnati lost 14.8% of it's population. '80-'90 saw 5.6% leave. Add in the Zimmer nuclear disaster and that will skyrocket, with (at the very minimum) thousands leaving the city of Cincinnati itself, potentially tens or hundreds of thousands in the region itself. This could effect other major cities in the area as well: Columbus, Cleveland, Louisville, Indianapolis, Detroit, Chicago, Pittsburgh. \n\nAll in all, I imagine that the number of deaths would largely be similar to real-life Chernobyl, plus or minus several thousand. Due to the massively increased media coverage though, this would probably kill nuclear energy in the West for a long-time. Depopulation of the Rust Belt is even more exacerbated. The US is momentarily a political pariah internationally, but I can't see that lasting too long because the Soviet Union is still seen as a threat. This definitely wouldn't stop the Soviet Union from falling apart. It *might* temporarily delay it, but the problems with the USSR are too ingrained and widespread for this to change anything. \n\nSince this is so close to major American cities, exploration of the exclusion zone would probably happen more frequently than if it was in a rural area. I imagine popular culture would be even more obsessed with post-apocalyptic media than it already has been. Tourists (of both legal and illegal varieties) would be widespread.\n\nEdit: This got a little rambly as I went on. I kept going back and adding stuff so parts might not flow or connect very well.\n\nEdit pt 2: See the below comment for the actual size of the evacuated areas. This would likely include the entire city of Cincinnati who would have to evacuate. That's several hundred thousand people in that city alone. I could legitimately see politicians fudging the numbers/evac zones so that the bulk of the city isn't included. If the city isn't ordered to evacuate, I imagine everyone who can afford to would get out, leaving everyone left to suffer from much higher cancer rates, birth defects, and incredible poverty. Imagine stereotypes of Detroit + health effects of Flint on steroids.",

        "&gt; You say that it is impossible to restore traditional flows but not only is it possible, we are working on part of it. The Kissimmee River Restoration Project is restoring 40 square miles of destroyed basin almost back to natural standards. All it took was the will to do it and business not actively paying politicians to stop it.\n\nWe learned about it in Water resource management class (4000 level). The Kissimme river became the C-38 canal but the local wildlife all but disappeared, so the river was restored, one of the biggest successes out of cooperation with the US Army COE and the South Florida Water Management District.Also you weren\u2019t off base I\u2019m a junior, but my parents raised me left till college. \n\nAnywho I\u2019m not wrong it\u2019s impossible to achieve the historic flows. The Everglades used to extend all the way from Lake O down the tip 4000 MILES.  Too much development would need to be wiped away to permanently fix and restore the everglades.\n\n&gt; You mention climate change as an issue\u00a0 and yet again conservative governments\u00a0 have not acted to improve the situation with many conservatives disbelieving it exists at all.\n\nOnce again more redditors painting broad strokes on conservatives. Yes there is ignorant conservatives who have this ideology but I\u2019m willing to bet majority of conservatives in THIS STATE don\u2019t believe such a stupid lie that Climate change isn\u2019t real.\n\n&gt; You say phosphorus isn't the issue from farms but the reference was a state report not a study. It also ignores the nitrates, industrial and livestock runoff which there are studies on, one linked at the bottom. Also it is interesting how you don't mention all of the sugar cane production that we dont have control over is being subsidized by the government. Why is the business supported without pushing them to improve mitigation for that subsidy. Side note, those subsidies disproportionately are given to the large producers that lobby. Huh who would have guessed.\n\nCorrect, their are multiple nutrients we have to take into account as well as livestock, I only specifically mentioned phosphorus for the sake simplicity (it\u2019s what most people recognize as a leading contributor to the blooms). I could talk about various TMDLs on various nutrients that we had to read for class but that would lose the point.\n\nWhen I say we don\u2019t have control over the sugar plantations/ farmers I literally mean we, environmentalist, the people, etc., can\u2019t do anything about it because of how tied up it is with politicians and interest groups who will do anything to stay alive and pay off (admittedly conservative) politicians to keep them alive. Of course their are huge economic benefits from the plantations but at the detriment of the environments health. Even if we actually somehow got a left governor in office who\u2019s all or nothing for the environment (fat chance but hypothetical), the way politics works here in this state is theirs a huge chance a governor like Andrew would lose re-election and thus any serious change would be forgoed. That\u2019s just the way policy works but I\u2019m just the first to admit it.\n\n&gt; One reason we have high population densities in those areas is because conservatives have pushed and approved those densities to maximize profits for their developer friends before. It's like saying I'm not pro your house burning down, but I did just set a fire in the kitchen and I don't feel like calling 911.\n\nYou know I was waiting for someone to rebuttal with this point so that\u2019s fair and true. But the way population growth is going with this state it\u2019s not gonna get better regardless of which party is in control for the near future.\n\n&gt; Right now though you are choosing data to support your belief and making excuses for politicians that don't deserve your loyalty.\n\nNo, I\u2019m trying to make people stop making this sub a \u201cconservative is evil nothing can come good from the right circlejerk.\u201d I\u2019m trying to give perspective and undermine such pessimism by showing that you don\u2019t have to be left to care about this stuff, their are educated people in this field that aren\u2019t liberal(I\u2019m definitely not their yet, but I know enough to form an educated opinion especially over the average redditor on this topic). I promised myself to go into College with an open mind and started to question the ideals I was raised with. Ultimately in retrospect I started to realize I leaned more the other way despite the pros and cons that entail conservatism vs what I was raised with.",

        "A school district in Beverly Hills, California, was saddled with a bill of at least $11 million to plug 19 oil wells on the property of its high school, after a judge in 2017 absolved Venoco LLC - the bankrupt company that had been operating the wells - of any responsibility for clean-up because other creditors took priority. The city of Beverly Hills is contributing another $11 million to the job.\n\n\u201cThis is an incredible amount of money\u201d siphoned away from education, said Michael Bregy, superintendent of the Beverly Hills Unified School District.\n\nState and federal regulations normally require drillers to pay an up-front bond to cover future cleanups if they go belly-up. But the rules are a patchwork, with wildly differing requirements, and they seldom leave governments adequately funded. In Pennsylvania, for example, it would take several thousand years to plug its estimated backlog of 200,000 abandoned oil wells at the current rate of spending, according to data from the state regulator.\n\nOil-industry lobbyists have been fighting state and federal efforts to increase the bonding, arguing it would hurt jobs and economic growth during an already tough time for the industry.\n\n\u201cStates and the federal government have many sources of funding available to reclaim and plug abandoned wells,\u201d said Reid Porter, a spokesman for the American Petroleum Institute, the country\u2019s largest oil and gas trade group.\nThe API spent $1.44 million in the first quarter of 2020 lobbying on Capitol Hill, with oil well bonding legislation one of the target issues, lobbying disclosures show.\n\nThe U.S. Government Accountability Office estimates that cleaning up and plugging an abandoned well runs from $20,000 to $145,000, **putting the price tag for cleaning up all of America\u2019s abandoned wells somewhere between $60 billion to $435 billion.**\n\n#\u2018SHOOTING OUT OF THE EARTH\u2019\n\n**The pollution threat goes beyond climate change. Leaks from abandoned wells have been found to contaminate groundwater and soil. In extreme cases, gas from abandoned wells has caused explosions.**\n\nIn Ohio and Texas, state regulators have each found an average of around two groundwater contamination incidents per year related to orphaned wells, according to research by the Groundwater Protection Council published in 2011 and dating to the 1980s.\n\nIn April 2017, for example, neighbors of Ohio farmer Stan Brenneman alerted him to the smell of oil coming from a drainage ditch on his 111-acre corn and soybean farm near the town of Elida, Brenneman told Reuters. The ditch drains water from the farm and carries it into rivers, streams and eventually Lake Erie.\n\nOhio\u2019s Division of Oil &amp; Gas Resources Management excavated 800 feet of the farm\u2019s drainage system to find a well casing - about 130 years old - releasing oil three feet underground. The plugging operation took two months to complete and cost the state $196,915, according to a spokeswoman for the state Department of Natural Resources.\n\nMore recently, in 2018, the U.S. EPA was alerted to the presence of nearly 50 abandoned oil and gas wells on Navajo Nation lands within the borders of Utah and New Mexico that were bubbling water at the surface. Tests showed the way from some of the wells contained potentially dangerous levels of arsenic, sulfate, benzene and chloride.\n\nThe Navajo Nation Environmental Protection Agency said plugging the wells would require \u201cmajor funds\u201d and that, in the meantime, the public had been warned not to drink the water.\n\nIn rare cases, gas from long-abandoned wells can cause dangerous accidents.\n\nIn January of last year, a 1930s-era well sent a geyser of gas and dirt 100 feet into the air at the construction site of a Marriott seaside hotel in Marina del Rey, California, an upscale community in the Los Angeles area, according to a state report. The hotel owners did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\u201cIt was horrifying,\u201d said resident Marilyn Wall, who witnessed the explosion from her home across the street. She said she was stunned \u201cby the extent and the length of time that the stuff was shooting out of the earth.\u201d\n\nA worker standing on a construction platform above the plume was sprayed with debris and scrambled to lower himself down with an escape rope, a video of the explosion shows.\n\n#DON\u2019T DRINK THE WATER\n\nFor Hanson and Michael Rowe, their troubles did not end the day their abandoned well was plugged. They no longer drink from the water well on their property because it gives them diarrhea, they said. Michael Rowe said she still suffers from headaches and coughing spells.\n\nKentucky\u2019s Energy and Environment Cabinet is still fighting to recoup the $383,340 cost from the now-defunct J.D. Carty and Blue Energy in an ongoing court battle.\n\nAn attorney for John Carty, founder of J.D. Carty, said his client had sold what few assets remained in the company and therefore bore no responsibility. A lawyer for Blue Energy said the company denies ever operating the wells on the property and has no responsibility to maintain or plug them.\n\nJ.D. Carty was only required to have one $50,000 \u201cblanket bond\u201d to cover all its wells in Kentucky. The amount forfeited to pay for the leaky well on Rowe\u2019s land, determined in part by its depth, was just $2,500 - less than 1% of the cost to fix it.\n\nAfter the incident, Kentucky lawmakers passed a bill last year that effectively doubled bond requirements for shallow wells to help cope with the state\u2019s 13,000 abandoned wells. Still, state regulators say the list of wells is growing.\n\nHanson Rowe said he supports fossil fuel development because using natural gas for heat and cooking has improved his quality of life. But the couple say they hope their lawsuit against the companies involved will help change the way the energy industry manages its wells.\n\n\u201cYou lost your health, you\u2019ve lost it all,\u201d Hanson Rowe said.\n\n#**(I've boldened sections that I feel are particularly noteworthy)**",

        "Without European colonization, the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois Confederacy) would have a much harder time rising to prominence among the other Iroquoian confederacies of the region. They'll have lost all their historic reasons for becoming expansive. No Europeans means no European diseases, means no grand Mourning Wars to rebuild the population. No Europeans means no European trade means no Beaver Wars to secure more hunting grounds for luxury furs.\n\nThat said, the Neutral Confederacy (which wouldn't be called \"Neutral\" in this timeline, because it'll have also lost its historic motive for remaining neutral) did have non-European aspirations for expansion. In the early 1500s, they were waging war with the Mascouten in southern Michigan to their west, and the Wenro (one of the members of the Confederacy) were pushing east into New York at the same time. They weren't the most populous people at the time, but held singificant influence over the flint trade - which meant they could influence who had access to better weaponry, pre-firearms. The major power within the confederacy, the Chonnontons, were also apparently experimenting with domesticating white-tailed deer, which would be a fun thing to extrapolate from if that had continued successfully. Unlike the Haudenosaunee though, they seem to have had more power centralized in a singular figurehead rather than distributed among the members of the Grand Council and the Clan Mother Council, though this could also be an erroneous interpretation by French missionaries looking for a king where none really existed.\n\nOf course, despite the lack of a nail, you could have the Haudenosaunee triumph over the Neutral Confederacy during the Wenro War and find some excuse for them to continue bringing more of the Iroquoian nations around them into the fold. Whether they'd extend further than that becomes trickier. They certainly wouldn't have a need for recruiting smaller Algonquian and Siouan nations from the Appalachians to help populate the newly depopulated Ohio Valley. Without the epidemic of the 1630s sweeping through the Ohio Valley or the subsequent Beaver Wars, there's no need to repopulate the area and nations like the Ofo / Mosopelea, the \"Monogehela\" / Massawomecks(?), Honniasont, etc., who are barely historical footnotes for us, would still be around in the region. It would be interesting to see what would have become of the post-Mississippian confederacy known to archaeologists as the Caborn-Welborn culture in the lower Ohio had they not be displaced.\n\nOne unassuming but significant change that seems likely to occur in the 500 years sans Columbus is the introduction of cotton to the Eastern Woodlands. We find cotton cloth among Mississippian grave goods, but no evidence that the Mississippians grew cotton themselves. They were probably trading for it from the Southwest. A lot of crops came to the Eastern Woodlands from the Southwest. Beans, for example, reached the Eastern Woodlands around 1300 AD. Cotton could be the next to make the jump across the Plains. This opens a new avenue for textile traditions in the area. Combined with the possibility of newly domesticated deer, it would revolutionize how people are clothed in the area - which was one of the less obvious limits on population growth. \n\n&gt; I.E. roadways are replaced with branching waterways cut from the Mississippi river leading east.\n\nHistorically speaking, even pre-Columbus, the rivers of the Eastern Woodlands were already utilized heavily for trade and travel. But there were also a significant network of major pathways crisscrossing the region - but I'll just mention three major ones here. The north/south Great Path stretched from Gasp\u00e9, Quebec on the Gulf of St. Lawrence to Mobile Bay on the Gulf of Mexico, following the valleys of the Appalachians (it ran parallel to the modern-day Appalachian Trail but was not synonymous with it). At Mobile Bay, it intersected with the Scioto Path, which ran due north Lake Erie - once it crossed the Ohio River, it ran parallel to the Scioto River, which gives it its name. At Lake Erie, it intersects with the east-west Great Path. If one turns eastward, this path runs down to Chesapeake Bay; if one turns westward, it heads into Michigan, turning north to cross into the Northern Peninsula before heading out to the northern Plains. These were major avenues for peace-time trade and travel as well. Warriors tended to favor less well-traveled highland trails where they'd be less likely to chance upon someone who could inform the enemy of their movement. When Europeans arrived, they used these trails as well, and only need to make slight modifications to accommodate their own wagons.",

I can only speculate about the purpose of this tag, but given the vintage and origin of the coin, it seems likely to be associated with that history.\n\nWindsor dog tax planchet tag (1900). The only significant find from my own property! In 1900, my home was occupied by an aging [Thomas H. Wright](https://accessgenealogy.com/canada/biography-of-thomas-h-wright.htm), former county treasurer, and some relatives.

        "Couple notes. Some you might already know, some might provide more context for others. (had a few drinks sorry). Important: I don't consider myself First Nations.\n\n1. Prior to the 1650s, this area was inhabited by First Nations (The Neutrals, Chonnonton, Attawandaron, many other names). The Neutrals faced disease and famine and greatly reduced numbers. Their final blow came from the Six Nations (five at the time), who destroyed the remaining population, either by killing them, or general diaspora. This was after the Neutrals accepted refugees from the enemies of the Six Nations. This area became significantly less-populated in the century following - the Six Nations didn't settle in this area, they returned home, to New York. Little (to my knowledge) archaeological evidence of settlement dates from 1650s-1800s. That said, after the removal of the Neutrals, the Mississaugas did make some use of the northern areas (reportedly little, but many sources around this subject aren't exactly great in reliability). This would have been probably quite far from Waterloo.\n\n2. The Six Nations got totally fucked in the American civil war, and the Six Nations were promised a sovereign nation of their own should they side with the British. **This has never happened.** They *weren't even present at the Treaty of Paris!!* This meant they had to sign their *own* treaty with the new USA, and gave up most of their land doing so. They got completely fucked by the British, who they helped. Following the war, the British, decided to use the Six Nations deal as a political buffer against the United States. There were two options to settle, the Grand River, or an area between Toronto and Kingston. Both were designed to position the Six Nations between Britain and the USA. Brant and his group chose GR. \n\n3. Even though there wasn't too much going on in this area in particular, Haldimand bought the land from the Mississaugas northeast of here, closer to Toronto. They didn't really inhabit too much of what you'd consider the Grand River area today, but they were nearby and made a little bit of use of the land. I can't remember my source right now, but I have also read suggestions that the Mississaugas understood that the lands would be shared.\n\n4. From the start, the idea of \"a sovereign territory for the Iroquois\" was complete horseshit. They *never* treated any of the six nations as self-governing or sovereign after they settled. The agreement sidestepped that completely. \n\nSeriously, read this shit. This is the proclamation:\n\n&gt;\u201cFrederick Haldimand, Captain-General and Governor-in-Chief of the Province of Quebec and Territories depending thereon, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c , General and Commander-in-Chief of His Majesty's Forces in said Province and the Frontiers thereof, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.\n        \n&gt;\u201cWhereas His Majesty having been pleased to direct that, in consideration of the early attachment to his cause manifested by the Mohawk Indians, and of the loss of their settlement which they thereby sustained, that a convenient tract of land, under his protection, should be chosen as a safe and comfortable retreat for them and others of the Six Nations, who have either lost their settlement, of wish to retire from them to the British. I have, at the earnest desire of many of these His Majesty\u2019s faithful allies, purchased a tract of land from the Indians, situated between the lakes Ontario, Erie and Huron, and I do hereby, in His Majesty\u2019s name, authorize and permit the said Mohawk Nation, and such others of the Six Nations Indians as wish to settle in that quarter, to take possession of and settle upon the banks of the river commonly called Ouse or Grand River, running into Lake Erie, allotting to them, for that purpose, six miles deep from each side of the river, Beginning at Lake Erie and extending in that proportion to the head of said river, which them and their posterity are to enjoy forever.\n\n&gt;Given under my hand and seal at arms, at the castle of St. Louis, at Quebec, this twenty-fifth day of October, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-four, and in the twenty-fifth year of the reign of our sovereign Lord George the Third, by the Grace of God, Great Britain, France and Ireland, King, Defender of the Faith, and so forth.\n\n&gt;                           FREDERICK HALDIMAND\n\nLike.....a sixth of the proclamation, maybe, describes what the fuck the land actually is. Imagine if today, you bought land and then sold it under the pretense of \"uh yeah the 6 miles either side of the river.\" Like I understand it was the late 1700s but come on, surveying was a thing, cartography was a thing, they didn't even know where the river headwaters WERE.\n\nTHAT's where some of the most contentious of this stems from today. It turns out, 15 or so years later, uh oh, the headwaters AREN'T in the area that Haldimand bought from the Mississaugas! Whoops! The Government DID own the land containing the headwaters at the time, but they refused to hand it over, claiming Haldimand could only have granted what the government owned at the time, despite the fucking legal proclamation he wrote (he was dead by then). \n\nSo they called up Surveyor Jones who mapped out the baseline, and it cut the proclaimed lands by about HALF. This, along with it being clear that a narrow strip of land through the middle of white settler-ville made it extremely difficult to keep manifest-destiners from settling, and limited the game available, are some of the reasons that the Six Nations began to sell other parts of the land. They preferred the guaranteed financial income of a mortgage, to the possibility the government might come around again with more bullshit like \"whoops! cartography glitch! half your land is gone to white settlers!\" which became more and more concerning, especially considering that european settlers were beginning to squat in the Six Nations lands, including here in Waterloo. This all leads eventually into the mennonite business and our current weird-ass city layout.\n\nSo, whether the sale of the lands was fair under the duress or not, is a concern that's less often addressed. Also less often addressed, is the idea of a sovereign Six Nations territory. What commonly comes up is that business about the headwaters.\n\nHonestly, at this point, a land grant of any kind is going to fuck over such a magnitude of people its pretty much impossible. Reconciliation is extremely complex and difficult. Cash in lieu is also extremely difficult, because if the government tries to make this move, the argument will come out that they need to pay current land value (arguable, sure). But current land value would be so absolutely insane in terms of cash......again I don't even know if its possible. And who does it go to, exactly? Six Nations Leadership, to distribute? Democratic leadership, or in the cultural norms of first nations? Current cultural norms, or those of 1784? How do we decide, a vote? Is that even right by the cultural norms? Cash payments to any first nations? how are we going to decide that, DNA/race testing? I'm sure thats a can EVERYBODY wants to open up. Its an absolute boondoggle.\n\nFrankly, in my personal opinion (which is always arguable) here in Waterloo, our debts to the Six Nations mostly concern whether the purchase of the lands from Six Nations (which was paid in full) was a sale under duress after losing the first half, or was a fair purchase. It might help to compare other land purchases around that time, and their values.  I haven't done that. Outside of the land purchase, there are always questions about the politics, like responsibility for the promises to grant land as a sovereign nation, or abandonment at the treaty of paris. \n\nEither way, I find it somewhat odd that most of the posters I see of the original grant, showing the original grant vs what Six Nations ocucpy today, don't highlight the difference between land sales, and the rescinding of the northern half by the Canadian government. Because that's seriously something that should be highlighted.",

        "--------\n**My Predictions for 2030**\n--------\n\nMy predictions might seem pessimistic compared to /u/Eudaimonics, but I think they are more realistic.  I do love my hometown, but I also know that, historically, this area is slow to grow and change.\n\n-------\nPopulation\n--------\n\nI think the population will remain stable, give or take 2%.\n\nToday we're at 258,612 for Buffalo and 925,528 for Erie County.\n\nThe city will remain a strong choice for many Millennials, however as they grow older and start families, many will move to the suburbs for the better schools.  However, Gen Z will be moving into the city at the same rate Millenials are moving out.\n\nNorth Buffalo, Elmwood, and downtown will remain hot spots.  South Buffalo and West Side will see some growth.  East Side will continue to disappoint.\n\nAs for the state of New York as a whole, I predict that we will see a sharp population decline.  (Buffalo will hold it's own.)  Florida and Texas will continue to see large population growth.\n\n-------\nSports\n------\n\nThe Bills will make the playoffs more times than not in the 2020s.  We'll go to one Super Bowl during the decade.\n\nA new football stadium will be built (or underway) by 2030. Unfortunately, it will be mostly funded by Erie County and New York taxpayers.   The field in Orchard Park will be an abandoned concrete wasteland and politicians will be debating what we should do about it.\n\nThe Sabres will make many playoff appearances, but no Stanley Cup.\n\n------\nSuburbs\n-------\n\nThe City of Tonawanda will be an \"up and coming\" neighborhood.  People will be attracted by new developments along the Erie Canal and Gateway Park.  It wil appeal to young people who want an urban-like atmosphere without the high housing prices of Buffalo.\n\nGrand Island will see significant development.  Amazon will open its new warehouse and there will be huge increases in truck traffic on the 190. Acreage will be swallowed up by developers, destroying the town's woodlands and semi-rural appeal.  There will be talk of a new bridge due to increased traffic going to and from the island.\n\n-------\nInfrastructure\n--------\n\nThe metro rail will not extend to Amherst by 2030.  I just can't see it getting through all of the studies, land acquisitions, and funding hurdles.  However, I bet we have new, sleek, futuristic-looking trains on the Metro by then.\n\nThe skyway will still be there, but it will be closed to traffic.  It'll be a park-like thing that not many people use.  Some will say it's still an eyesore.  (Personally, I don't mind it.)  There will be groups of people rallying to re-open it to traffic.  (Similar to the \"re-open Main Street to traffic\" demands that we saw from the public several years ago.)\n\nRide sharing services will continue to grow.  Very few Millennials and GenZers will own cars, but older folks will hold onto them.  Self-driving cars will not be common in Buffalo throughtout the 2020s, but they'll just start to come onto the scene around 2030.\n\n-------\nBusiness\n-------\n\nThe redevelopment of the Eastern Hills Mall and Boulevard Mall will only be partly complete.  I predict a lack of interest in \"mixed use\" property in the suburbs.\n\nSwiss Chalet will return to Western New York.  I predict the chain will want to expand into the states and the Buffalo market will be a great place to start.\n\nThe Buffalo News will no longer be a 7-day-a-week publication.  In the 2020s, they'll reduce to 6 days a week, then 5, then 3.  Then, by 2027, they will go out of business altogether.  \n\nFantasy Island will close after 60+ years.  Their new management has done a poor job of keeping the park up and keeping customers happy.\n\nIn 2030 Tesla and Solar City will no longer operate in the Buffalo Gigafactory.  In fact, I have doubts that Tesla will still exist as a company by then.\n\n\n------\nWeather, Climate, and Ecology\n-------\n\nI am not a climate change denier, but I don't think our average temperature or average snowfall will change significantly by 2030.  Currently, according to Wikipedia, we average 94.7 inches of snow.  The average high temp for the year is 56.4.  We've never hit 100 degrees in Buffalo and I predict that this will remain true in 2030.\n\nI'll guess that we will have historic storm sometime in the 2020s, like the Blizzard of 77 or the October Surprise Storm.  The big story will be about how neighbors come together to help each other out.\n\nWater levels in Lake Erie, Lake Ontario, and the Niagara River are at record highs as I write this.  I predict that, sometime before 2030, we'll be near record low water levels.  The levels have risen and fallen a lot over the years.\n\nAsian Carp will be common throughtout the Great Lakes. Calm water areas (like the Erie Canal and Buffalo River) will be infested with them.\n\n-------\nCrime\n-------\n\nBuffalo has one of the highest crime rates in the country.  Wiki cites a BizJournals statistic that ranks us as the 15th worst city in the US for crime.  The website [Neighborhood Scout](https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/ny/buffalo/crime) says Buffalo is safer than 4% of US cities (4 out of 100).\n\nI think violent and nonviolent crime rates across the nation will go down.  Buffalo's crime will go down too.  But unfortunately I predict that our ranking as one of the worst in the nation will remain.",

        "The War of 1812 was a conflict fought between the United States and the United Kingdom, with their respective allies, from June 1812 to February 1815. Historians in Britain often see it as a minor theatre of the Napoleonic Wars; historians in the United States and Canada see it as a war in its own right.\n\nFrom the outbreak of war with Napoleonic France, Britain had enforced a naval blockade to choke off neutral trade to France, which the US contested as illegal under international law. To man the blockade, Britain pressed American merchant sailors into the Royal Navy. American sentiment grew increasingly hostile toward Britain due to incidents such as the Chesapeake\u2013Leopard affair, which happened five years before the war. The British were in turn outraged by the Little Belt affair in 1811, in which 11 British sailors died. Britain supplied arms to American Indians who raided American settlers on the frontier, hindering American expansion and provoking resentment. Historians debate whether the desire to annex some or all of British North America (Canada) contributed to the American decision to go to war. However, the Western interest was in expansion into American territories such as Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin, where they were threatened by Indians supported by the British. On June 18, 1812, President James Madison signed into law the American declaration of war, after heavy pressure from the War Hawks in Congress.\n\nWith most of its army in Europe fighting Napoleon, Britain adopted a defensive strategy, with offensive operations initially limited to the border and the western frontier. American prosecution of the war effort suffered from its unpopularity, especially in New England, where it was referred to as \"Mr. Madison's War\". American defeats at the Siege of Detroit and the Battle of Queenston Heights thwarted attempts to seize Upper Canada, improving British morale. American attempts also failed to invade Lower Canada and capture Montreal. In 1813, the Americans won the Battle of Lake Erie, gaining control of the lake, and they defeated Tecumseh's Confederacy at the Battle of the Thames, securing a primary war goal. The Americans made a final attempt to invade Canada but fought to a draw at the Battle of Lundy's Lane during the summer of 1814. At sea, the powerful Royal Navy blockaded American ports, cutting off trade and allowing the British to raid the coast at will. In 1814, one of these raids burned the capital, but the Americans later repulsed British attempts to invade New York and Maryland, ending invasions from Canada into the northern and mid-Atlantic states. In early 1815, the Americans decisively defeated the invading British Army attacking New Orleans, Louisiana. Fighting also took place in Spanish Florida; a two-day battle for the city of Pensacola ended in Spanish surrender.\n\nIn Britain, there was mounting opposition to wartime taxation, and merchants demanded to reopen trade with America. With the abdication of Napoleon, Britain's war ended with France and Britain ceased impressment, rendering the issue irrelevant of the impressment of American sailors. The British were then able to increase the strength of the blockade on the United States coast, smothering American maritime trade, but their attempts failed to invade America, at which point both sides began to desire peace.\n\nPeace negotiations began in August 1814, and the Treaty of Ghent was signed on December 24, 1814. News of the peace did not reach America for some time. In February 1815, news reached the East Coast concerning the great victory at New Orleans\u2014at the same time as news of the Christmas peace treaty. The Americans triumphantly celebrated the restoration of their national honour, leading to the collapse of anti-war sentiment and the beginning of the Era of Good Feelings, a period of national unity. The treaty was unanimously ratified by the US Senate on February 17, 1815, ending the war with no boundary changes.\n\nThe Battle of the Thames, also known as the Battle of Moraviantown, was a decisive American victory in the War of 1812 against Great Britain and its Indian allies in Tecumseh's Confederacy. It took place on October 5, 1813 in Upper Canada, near Chatham. The British lost control of Southwestern Ontario as a result of the battle; Tecumseh and war chief Roundhead were killed, and Tecumseh's Confederacy largely fell apart.\n\nBritish troops under Major General Henry Procter had occupied Detroit until the United States Navy gained control of Lake Erie, depriving them of their supplies. Procter was forced to retreat north up the Thames River to Moraviantown, followed by the tribal confederacy under Shawnee leader Tecumseh and war chief Roundhead who were his allies. American infantry and cavalry under Major, and future president, General William Henry Harrison drove off the British and then defeated the Indians, who were demoralized by the deaths of Tecumseh and Roundhead in action. American control was re-established in the Detroit area, the tribal confederacy collapsed, and Procter was court-martialled for his poor leadership.\n\nWilliam Henry Harrison's force numbered at least 3,500 infantry and cavalry. He had a small detachment of regulars from the 27th U.S. Infantry and five brigades of Kentucky militia led by Isaac Shelby, the 63 year-old governor of Kentucky and a hero of the American Revolutionary War. He also had 1,000 volunteer cavalry under Colonel Richard Mentor Johnson. Most of Johnson's men were from Kentucky, but some were from the River Raisin area of Michigan, all of them spurred on by the slogan \"Remember the River Raisin.\" (to know why, see [Battle of Frenchtown] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Frenchtown)).\n\nProcter had about 800 soldiers, mainly from the 41st Regiment. The veterans of the regiment's 1st Battalion had been serving in Upper Canada since the start of the war and had suffered heavy casualties in several engagements in 1813, including the Battle of Lake Erie, where more than 150 of its men had served aboard Barclay's ships. They had been reinforced by the young soldiers of the 2nd Battalion. Most of the regiment's officers were dissatisfied with Procter's leadership, but Colonel Warburton, the next in seniority, refused to countenance any move to remove him from command. Tecumseh and Roundhead led about 500 Indians.\n\nMore infos about the [War of 1812] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812)\n\nMore infos about the [Battle of the Thames] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Thames)",

        "I hope this is what your looking for, but a hobby i do on the side is Reenacting the Second World War. \n\nWe normally do battles at events held in different places around the country, and tend to travel a bit place to place, but the same things stays with every battle: Real Gear, Real Rifles, Real machinery, real explosives \u201cfake\u201d bullets though (They are called blanks, same stuff they use in hollywood to make it look like the gun is firing live rounds, spoiler alert: blanks don\u2019t actually propel a projectile only the gas is exhausted from the casing) Long story short, this is a dangerous hobby.\n\nOne of the events i went to last year around August or so was a D-Day event in Conneaut, Ohio (its one of the biggest, if not the biggest, event in the country with hundreds of reenactors and thousands of spectators, thick of Conneaut as comic-con but for reenactors) and something that will stick to me for ever is the Beach battle.\n\nThe Beach we were doing the battle/landing on was off of Lake Erie, it was about a mile and a half, maybe more from the water to the top of a huge steep hill. all on the beach and said hill had fortifications galore, were talking pillboxes, Hedgehogs, \u201cMines\u201d, Barbed wire, Trenches, Sea walls, Dragons teeth, anything you could find or think of basically. *Now quick Disclaimer before i say my story: We are reenactors, NOT soldiers. we practice for everything and we know what is mostly going to happen, nobody was actually hurt during the landing or killed, so when i say \u201chalf of my squad went down\u201d i don\u2019t mean that they are dead, they are just playing dead. and lastly, since there is no way to truly get hit by a blank, hits are an honor system: you see someone shoot at you then you are dead, no argument* \n\nSo: I was walking towards the edge of the beach, i had a M1903 in hand and a Stripper clip ready in my pocket. i remember i kinda stumbled in the sand, because my boot didn\u2019t have the best traction due to age and quality. when i arrived to the beach head, the Wind hit my face and the sun stayed high in the sky. there were clouds, but it was mostly sunny. as i sat in the sand: i ask myself \u201chow is the battle gonna start? is there a flare? a signal?\u201d and just at that moment: a B-25 Flys over my head flying super low for a bomber, i passed over the bunkers the Germans were hiding in, and all of a sudden all hell breaks loose. i remember hearing 2-3 more planes coming in, a C-47 and two P-51s. the 51s started strafing the beach while the C-47 and B-25 Began to circle. As i watched, i could hear the Anti-Aircraft guns start to Point up and fire, there was a huge \u201cKACHUNK\u201d of a Flak 88mm and and a bunch of rifle and machine gun fire. I felt like i was watching a movie behind the scenes (Granted, not real bullets so i guess i was behind the scenes?) As i watched i got a bump on my shoulder and my friend Dan told me its time to line up. I got up, sprinted to a line, loaded my M1903 with my stripper clip, and waited in a line. Then: the planes went away. Silence. a sudden Whistle and a loud scream \u201cLETS GO BOYS, CHARGE!\u201d i was sprinting towards the beachhead, sand under my boot, i could hear a \u201cBURRRRRT\u201d of a MG42 and MG34 firing towards us. i looked behind us and a second wave was getting ready in a line. when i turned back and was taking cover behind a hedgehog and two guys were cutting barbed wire, one of them took a hit and someone else too the wire cutters as the \u201cwounded\u201d got dragged away. when we got through the wire i sprinted as much as i could to a foxhole in front of me, i landed inside it and began to return fire. each time: \u201cBANG, Cycle bolt, BANG, cycle bolt\u201d i did this till i was out, opened my bolt, Reloaded and waited. i turned around again and Wave 2 was coming up. a man looked at mean like he was about to jump into my fox hole and when he looked back up he fell to the ground. he looked up at me and said \u201cWelp, im just gonna say im dead, mind calling for a medic?\u201d i chuckled a bit and pointed one towards his way. after a constant barrage of fire: i found myself charging again towards a Sea wall, i was sprinting so fast, someone threw a smoke grenade so i couldn\u2019t quite see. i hit the wall smiled turned around and...oh crap all of my squad are \u201cdead\u201d. \u201c*Well fuck*\u201d i said. i felt my adrenaline pumping the closer i got, i looked over the wall, saw someone point at me, and aimed, i ducked and then heard the bang of a Kar 98. i popped up again and shot, the riflemen went down, i got one. as i was sitting at the seawall, almost the entire wall started to fill up with people. after a few moments, another squad charged up the sea wall and made it to the fortifications. we were in the home stretch. as soon as i got up and went over the sea wall, i could see people taking \u201cPrisoners\u201d and disarming the Germans. The loud speakers declared the battle over, and the crowd watching us cheered. i forgot about the crowd for the battle, and only when i heard the roar of applause and cheers did i snap back into reality. \n\nSo thats my action adventure movie story thing? i\u2019m sorry it was long and probably annoying to read, but there are too many details to just leave out. Just to say again: Reenactors are not real soldiers, we are historians. we don\u2019t believe in anything/ideology from the era and also on that note: Fuck the Nazis. Lastly: If your a veteran and reading this: thank you so much for your service hopefully i didn\u2019t disrespect any vets with this story because all of you have 110% been through hell and deserve so much respect. Thank you for your time, and have a great day! :)",

        "The 68-70 murders are \n\nJacqueline Dunleavy: January 9 1968- Jacqueline was a 16 year old student in grade 10 at Westminister secondary school. She was working at the Stanley Variety Store (located on Stanley Street at Wharncliffe road). Her shift ended at 6:35 PM and she was last seen leaving the store, believed to be heading south on Wharncliffe to catch a bus home. At 8:10 PM three young men found her body on the grounds of the Katherine Harley school (Oxford Street, west of Sanitorium road) near the Childhood Psychiatric Research Institute. She had a head injury, but her cause of death was strangulation. [source](https://www.londonpolice.ca/en/about/Unsolved-Murders.aspx)\n\nFrankie Jensen: February 9 1968: Frankie Jensen was a 9 year old boy who was in grade 4. He was delayed in heading to school for a reason I can't remember, so that morning he was walking to Westdale Public School on his own instead of with a large group of children like normal. The area was fairly rural at the time, and his usual route took him through a field to get to school. A neighbour saw him walking down Hyde Park Road, but he never made it to school. On April 13 1968 Frankie's body was found in the Thames River near the village of Thamesford, just east of London. His boots and lunch box were missing and he was partially clothed. He lived around 2 kms from where Jacqueline Dunleavy's body was found, just off of Oxford Street.\n\nScott Leishman: February 15 1968: Scott was a 16 year old boy from Thorndale, a small village about a ten minute drive northeast of London. He was last seen getting into an unknown car after fishing. His body was found in Big Otter Creek/Lake Erie, in Port Burwell's harbour, about 70kms southeast of London.\n\nHelga Beer: August 6 1968: Helga was a 31 year old employed by a major department store downtown. At 6:25 AM that morning her body was found in the back seat of her 1963 Beatle in a parking lot at 50 Carling Street. She was naked from the waist down and had been strangled. She had been seen between midnight and 1 with an unknown white man between the ages of 24-34.\n\nLynda White: November 14 1968: Lynda was a 19 year old student at the University of Western Ontario (located in north London), She went missing from somewhere in the area of Oxford Street and Wharncliffe Road (she lived nearby and had been dropped off by a friend after a french exam). Her skeletal remains was found in Norfolk county, 70ish kms southeast of London in 1973.\n\nBruce Stapylton: June 1969: 11 year old boy. Very little info on this off the top of my head. He was found dead in a wood lot slightly north of the city, in the area of Adelaide and Sunningdale road.\n\nJackie English: October 4 1969: 15 years old. Jackie was last seen getting into a car on the Wellington Street overpass over highway 401, as she was heading home after her shift as a waitress at a cafe. Her body was found in Big Otter Creek, near Tilsonburg, 60 kms southeast of London. She was nude, but her belongings were scattered throughout rural areas in Elgin and Oxford county. Later some belongings were found dumped near an apartment she had lived at previously in the Wortley Village area of London.\n\nSoroya O\u2019Connell: August 14 1970: 15 years old. Soroya was last seen after telling friends she was going to hitchhike home from a dance at the Fanshawe youth centre (I believe near the Huron and Highbury intersection, but I could be wrong). Her skeletal remains were found in 1974 at an old dump, south of Stratford, about 60 kms northeast of London.",

        "I intend to be one of  the best landlords  in my city. \nI purchased a 2 Family fixxer upper in the neighborhood where I grew up. It nice 2 bed up each unit, accross street from Bus route, 1 Mile from Marina/Lake Erie and also 13 Minute drive to Downtown. This house I saved and purchased cash for 33,500 and it is a bit rough but atleast I have no monthly payment, I am currently saving to purchase new furnace, appliances and just make the house newer again. The way I wish to be the Greatest Landlord is as follows. \n\n1) I will be living in the FULL size attic that I have already sealed and made livable. Currently working on the other 4 bedrooms and apartments in general. The 4 bed rooms will rent for 400 dollars PER month each room will have 1 single tenant with a key to each room for privacy. The rooms are small and although a tenant can have a sleepover this will be a SINGLES room rental. The people I rent out to will have to interact and interview with me for hobbie comparability because I wish to live with people who share my hobbies because between all 5 we will Dominate said hobby :)\n\n2) this rent for a SINGLE bedroom where a SINGLE person can live and bring a partner for a day or two but what they will NOT be allowed is to move in a boyfriend or girlfriend simply because the space is not enough. Should they meet a person they can just move out , no notice needed, just move out whenever...its just a room I paint and rent within a week to another single person. The rent I charge is 400 dollars and seems like Alot ...and it actually is alot BUT here is what is included and services that I will provide for my Tenants. The 400 rent per person per month will include SHARED use of everything like ....\n\nRent is 400 per month\n\nALL utilities are included like water,power gas,sewer.\n\nCable TV and wifi internet with a FULLY loaded Computer office station in the house for use for all.\n\nThe Basement is big but not a finished basement however  we will set an area in the corner where it will have the small Jacuzzi &amp; a 2 person pour water on rocks  Steam Sauna where a tenant can go and use both for a nice cleanse of the pores.\n\nI am a gamer and movie enthusiast so my Tenants will also be gamers and movie critics and so my Tenants will have access to my movie and game wall featuring  over 100 Ps4 games, over 100 4K blu rays , hundreds of retro games , I have ALOT of the retro consoles like Nintendo, sega,ps1 ,atari and more with hundreds of games between all consoles.my Tenants that will be gamers will find this like a DREAM HAVEN \n\nAlso, I have used cars that I use DAILY and I protect my NEW 2020 Ford F-150 parked in the Driveway with under 2,000 miles however my Tenants if we need to move or pick something big or they have a friend they want to help then my Pickup will be allowed to be used OR I have 3 used cars I buy them at auction and that my tenants will be able to use in an emergency if their car is down or in shop.\n\nI have a Brand NEW 2019 Yamaha Jet Ski 3 seater that is supercharged and Fast that ( remember) I lve 1 mile from the Marina and so we can be in the Lake in 15 minutes !!! So my Tenants will be allowed to use it with certain restrictions such as hours...example they can ask me to use it for 5 hours PER month BUT they pay their own gas. The reason I can allow FULL use is because I use it alot and also make side money with it ,however I will make sure to have 1 hour PER week that my tenant can just call and meet me at lake and use it( they pay gas)\n\nAlso my Tenants will have FULL access to use the 2 Snowmobile that are 2017 BUT they are in like NEW condition and alot of fun. This is something that can be hitched to the truck and we can all hit the mountains for fun. And same goes for the Jet ski because there will be times where we hitch the jet ski, put a 2018 Four wheeler in the pick up cab and it makes for a Fun weekend adventure!!! \n\nAs long as the person is solo tenant basically they can move in and for 400 PER month become an Adventure Junkie lol \n\nSee how soon I will become one of the greatest tenants ? \nI am hopeful that people notice me and share like me :)\n\nWish me luck please, I am currently saving and when I reach 5,000 dollars cash will start the rehab of the Apartments because I finished Attic and now tearing down the flooring in other 2 units.",

        "If we're talking about ships, a common way to understand the advantage in an engagement is simple arithmetic to figure the \"broadside weight\" or \"weight of metal;\" in other words, counting up the combined weight of one side of the ship firing all of its guns. \n\nLet's take for instance a 28 gun frigate. Twenty-four of its guns are broadside guns, aligned on its gun deck to fire perpendicular to the motion of the ship. Four are \"chasers,\" mounted in the bow and stern. The number and type of each gun should be suited to the ship's ability to not only bear their weight when sailing (each gun might weigh several hundred pounds at least), but also how well the ship itself could withstand the firing of its guns: the recoil of a large gun could damage the gun's mounting and could even cause damage to the planking and structural supports of the ship itself.\n\nSo, arming the ship, we have to consider the ability of the ship to bear the weight and recoil shock of the guns it carries, and a somewhat decent broad framework for this is simple size. In our example, a 28-gun frigate is a single-deck, relatively small ship, and would be unlikely to be able to bear twenty-four 32-pound long guns. Let's take, for example, the Royal Navy's [\"Enterprise\" class](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/Siren_%28alternative_spelling-_Syren%29_%281773%29%3B_Fox_%281773%29%3B_Enterprize_%281773%29_%28alternative_spelling-_Enterprise%29%3B_Surprize_%281774%29_RMG_J6308.png) sixth-rate frigates. They mounted twenty-four 9 pounder guns on the gundeck, and carried four 6 pounders on the quarterdeck as chasers. One of these frigates could fire, if all guns were mounted, a broadside weight of 216 pounds.\n\nIf the ship could bear it, we could scale up the damage-dealing broadside guns to 12 pounders, bringing our broadside weight up to 288 pounds. If we were really ambitious and the ship was well maintained, we might even get away with 18 pounders, for a broadside total of 432 pounds.\n\nKeep in mind this is just a loose metric that could compare the ships in their ability to deal damage, instead of the myriad other ways that ships were categorized and sized up: the confusion of frigates and sloops and brigs and snows and razees and ratings, to say nothing of sail plans and nuances of design and construction are all factors in a naval engagement, and good captains were generally relied upon to know in an instant the tonnage, size, speed and maneuver, armament, and broadside weight of their opponent's ships with some degree of accuracy - these factors are often used in courts-martial for captains who lost their ships, as well as in the more day-to-day despatches and descriptions of ships taken. For example, [Horatio Nelson reported](https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/13986/page/200) the engagement of the *HMS Minerve*, under the command of Captain George Cockburn, against a Spanish frigate:\n\n&gt; Captain Cockburne brought his Ship to close Action at Twenty Minutes before Eleven, which continued without Intermission till Half past One, when La Sabina, of Forty Guns, Twenty-eight Eighteen-Pounders on her Main-Deck, Two Hundred and Eighty-six Men,  Captain Don Jacoba Stuart, having lost her Mizen-Mast, (as he did\nafter the Action) Main and Fore Mast, One Hundred and Sixty four Men killed and wounded, struck her Colours. \n\nAttention was paid to the class of the ship, its armament, and its crew count. The [*Minerve*](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/MINERVE_FL.1795_%28FRENCH%29_RMG_J5347.jpg) herself was a 40-gun frigate, which carried twenty-eight 18-pounders and twelve 8-pounders, a broadside weight of 408 pounds. The Spanish frigate, was similar in size and armament, and only going on Nelson's report of the twenty-eight 18 pounders on her main deck, would have given each side of shot at 252 pounds.\n\nIn terms of the raw power of the shot sizes, it seems fairly clear that in frigate actions, 18 pounders were considered heavy enough to deal damage but light enough to be carried well on smaller ships. Ships of the line, the real big ships, might carry hundreds of guns of a range of weights, but it wouldn't be out of the realm of possibility to carry 36 pounders or more. \n\nThe arithmetic of this is all based on being able to effectively damage the enemy ships: it seems like 9 pounders were, for frigates, about the lightest we might want to carry as anything but chasers, and as the wars of the French Revolution wore on, the trend was for heavier and heavier main-deck guns, all the way up until all the math is thrown out when carronades make their entrance.\n\nCarronades were nothing much more than truncated cannons; shorter, stubbier, but heavier built so they were less likely to explode, but they were also allowed smaller ships to carry *much* heavier guns; the *Minerve* eventually supplemented her 18 pounder main-deck guns with sixteen 32 pound carronades, and switched out the 8 pound chasers for 6 pounders. Some quick math puts the *Minerves* carronade broadside, just with the 18s and 32s, at 508 pounds.\n\nTo round this all out: the heavier the ball, the more damage it could possibly inflict, but the more weight of the gun to fire it, the more weight of powder to propel it, the more severe the recoil, and the more chance to throw the ballast of the ship out of whack. Ship's timbers functioned as a sort of armor, but also protected them from their *own* broadsides.\n\nBut the weight of shot, while not the singular element of single-ship action success as championed by Teddy Roosevelt (he wrote [*The Naval War of 1812*](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Naval_War_of_1812/ToUTAQAAMAAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=0) that stressed broadside weight as more or less the reason the Americans won so many single-ship actions, and says that it was the determining factor in the Battle of Lake Erie), was absolutely an important factor in ship engagements, and we can see a steady creep in the weight of armament of even similarly-classed vessels throughout the duration of the long 18th century.\n\n_______\nSources as linked above.",

        "Hey, so just a heads up, this sub is a bit of a haven for Connecticut bashing sometimes, as you can see from these responses.  r/Hartford might be a good resource for a more balanced viewpoint.\n\nThat being said, there are some valid gripes that have been touched on.   I\u2019ll give you some negatives to start, and finish strong with the positives...\n\n(Note: I visited transplanted family in Iowa City last year, so I\u2019m using there as my baseline)\n\nThe negatives of moving to Connecticut...\n1.  The cost of living across the northeast will be higher than Idaho.  You need to factor that in.  The Hartford area is not as bad as the areas near NYC and the shoreline, so make your analysis wisely.  People on this sub will gripe about taxes, and while yes they are relatively high here, if you have kids you will be glad with the quality of our schools and other services.\n\n2.  I don\u2019t know the traffic in Columbus, but Connecticut\u2019s traffic is significant, though quite frankly traffic in the Hartford area is a DREAM compared to Boston and NYC and I-95 (on a side note, Boston\u2019s city planners can go bite the big one.   Seriously).   Be mindful that Connecticut drivers will be more aggressive than Iowa.   (Another side note: you can speed here unlike, say, Iowa City.)\n\n3.  There is nothing like Yellowstone here.   This is a tragedy.  I have been blessed to visit out there three times.  I now know what God\u2019s backyard looks like.\n\n4.  Hartford itself is a relatively small city for the Northeast (think the population slightly larger than Cedar Rapids, but in a smaller area), and has its issues with crime.   (I will make a shout out to the young professional and artist communities in Hartford, though, that are driving a lot of good stuff in the city).  \n\n4 1/2.  There\u2019s nothing like Iowa Nice here.  New Englanders tend to be standoffish and less friendly in comparison.   \n\nOk, now some positives...\n\n5.   Lake Erie is not the Atlantic Ocean.   And the Atlantic Ocean has never been set on fire :). Seriously, Long Island Sound is a great boating resource, and actual beaches are not that far a drive away.\n\n6.  The New England states are quite small, so you can travel around the region and really get around.   You will see a lot of Western Mass and I suppose Rhode Island, too.   You can apparently find decent skiing farther north (I don\u2019t ski myself, but I don\u2019t think I should be touting that to some who has lived near the Rockies, though).\n\n7.  The food here is much better.  I don\u2019t know Columbus at all, but trust me when I say the food is better here.   Connecticut is where a lot of Italian immigrants settled back in the day.   After God made Yellowstone, he got a bit hungry so he invented Italian food.  New Haven is the birthplace of pizza, you will find no better pizza than NYC, Long Island, or New Haven (side note: deep dish is NOT pizza.  I will fight you on this point).   Be mindful though that Hartford-area\u2019s pizza tends to fall short of New Haven.  And somehow they think red potato on pizza is acceptable in this state.  I mean, we\u2019re talking a one starch put upon another starch!  Madness!\n\n8.  Hartford is roughly half-way between NYC and BOS.   A day trip is totally doable to both.   This is a good thing, trust me.\n\n9.  Connecticut does lean Democrat at the federal and state levels, but runs fairly strongly Republican among several local municipalities.   You could say we\u2019re Democratic cities running Republican suburbs and small towns.   Some good flash points:  the debates on re-introducing highway tolls, the looming legalization of marijuana, and the debates around the high school mascot in Killingly.   There\u2019s probably a need for someone interested in civic service.\n\n10. We have craft breweries and a wine trail and interesting festivals.  You will find things to do here socially, though not as much as a larger city.\n\n11.  Hartford has a pretty good local arts community, and there are a group of young folks that really do care about the city.  \n\n\nSorry for the long essay, but I hope it is useful.",

        "When I bring first timers to my hometown of Erie, here are the unique and quirky things I take them to that aren't really things you experience anywhere else:\n\nTo Snack\n\n-Greek Dogs and Greek Fries at New York Lunch (meat \"sauce\" on these local hot dogs and fries is a unique and delicious culinary experience and something I crave all the time since moving away)\n\n-Sponge Candy at Romolo's (sounds weird but again, unique and kinda life changing--any time people know I'm going to Erie they ask me to bring them back some of this stuff)\n\n-Pizza Muffins at Public House (not technically unique but definitely dank... Cool Irish bar with a ton of drafts)\n\nTo Drink\n\n-Mazza Winery or any other Winery out in North East (yeah, everybody will tell you that wine made from Concord grapes is shit and they're probably right, but it's a unique experience and honestly, as a wine snob myself, some of this stuff really isn't that bad)\n\n-Scotty's Cigars and Jazz (divey as hell and every bit as charming as it is divey, this prohibition era hidden gem is a great place to get a traditional or flavored martini made by Scotty, the blacked-out drunk-uncle-of-an-owner or one of his charming bar tenders. If you're into it, smoke a very reasonably priced cigar in a dimly lit room that feels like it's straight out of a movie. Don't let the neighborhood or the exterior of the building scare you off, because this is the low key coolest bar I've ever been to.)\n\n-Lavery Brewing (the best local microbrewery and also a charming place to hang out. Other microbreweries to visit include Voodoo and Millcreek Brewing, but if you only make it to one, it should be Lavery. Erie Brewing has a tap house in harbor creek that also serves the only worthwhile pizza in town but it's not unique enough to recommend wasting a day or meal on it)\nEdit, apparently Erie Brewing took over the Milcreek Brewing location\n\n-1000 Beers (best selection of beer of any bar in town or possibly anywhere. Hence the name. Literally thousands of beers available to grab out of coolers while you snack on popcorn.)\n\n-Plymouth Tavern (I hate this place with a passion because every person I ever went to high school with is in here and still on the same bender they were on when we turned 21, but their nightly specials are truly unparalleled...25 cent drafts, $1 imports, etc depending on the night. Plus less cranky, less old people than me hang out there and seem to like it)\n\nTo Dine\n\n-Dinner at Noosa in North East (local chef cooking gourmet yet affordable takes on comfort food, and local booze, all at a restaurant in a marina with stunning views of the lake and sun set. Same chef also owns a totally different but equally delicious pan-Asian restaurant in downtown Erie called 1201, also worth a visit)\n\n-Pineapple Eddy (amazing Caribbean and southern food made by a local cook. Martin Luther King Jr's son was only in town for one night and this is where he ate. You won't regret it.)\n\n-The Cork (everybody seems to like this place besides me, so maybe I'm the asshole and I don't wanna let my bias get in the way)\n\n-Shoreline Bar and Grille at Bayfront Courtyard Marriott (I generally would rather go anywhere than a hotel restaurant but this one actually has very good food like the lobster roll. Nice views of the bay too)\n\n-I really can't enthusiastically recommend any other restaurants that are unique. Tandoori Hut if you like Indian food, Federal Hill if you like BBQ, El Canelo if you like authentic Mexican, but none of this stuff is unique to Erie\n\nTo Do/Experience\n\n-Sit super close to the action at genuinely high level minor league sports at the beautifully renovated Erie Insurance Arena. Check the schedules if you're into sports. Locals take for granted that Erie is home to legitimate minor league sports teams. The Erie Bayhawks are the NBA G League Affiliate of the New Orleans Pelicans. Jeremy Lin played for the team before Linsanity. The Erie Otters are in one of the 3 top tier level Canadian hockey leagues for high school age players. 2018 NHL MVP Connor McDavid and reigning Stanley Cup Finals MVP Ryan O'Reilly both played for the team before going directly to the NHL.\n\n-Drive around Presque Isle State Park (Lake Erie is the 11th biggest lake on Earth, and this state park is the best way to appreciate it. The name is French for \"almost an island\" so you get the idea, it juts out into the lake. To the north you can see all the way to Canada on a clear day and to the south you look back at the city of Erie. The best things to see beyond just driving aimlessly are the North Pier light house, Houseboat Lagoon...super weird especially in the fog but there's nothing like it.... Over a dozen floating homes grandfathered into permanent position in the park... And the monument to commodore Oliver Hazard Perry, the hero of the Battle of Lake Erie in the war of 1812)\n\n-U.S. Brig Niagara (1812 ship used by the aforementioned commodore to defeat the British in the Battle of Lake Erie. It makes its permanent home in Erie, although it may be traveling the great lakes or closed for the season. Worth looking at even if you can't get on board this time of year\n\n-Tom Ridge Center (named for Erie native and the first Secretary of Homeland Security and former Governor of PA, it's a free museum about nature and the lake and its watershed)\n\n-Historic Waterford (a little bit of a drive, but this historic town is home to one of the only statues of George Washington wearing a British uniform in America. Also home to some interesting and supposedly haunted old things, like the Eagle Hotel. Not really much else to do out there but it's old and historic and some people like myself find that interesting)\n\n-Peek n Peak (ski resort with tubing, spas, and other interesting dining and season specific activities)",

        "Hey, I'm writing a similar story myself! Not everything here is specifically Cleveland related, but if this event is taking place 6 years after a fictional \"end of the world as we know it\" there are a few things you may want to take into account. Take advantage of the research I've done!\n\n - Cleveland has salt mines, which would be absolutely essential to life if shipping stopped. Powering the pumps and equipment would be the greatest challenge.\n\n - While solar panels have a long service life (they lose about 20% efficiency over 20 years) they are vulnerable to breakage, require regular cleaning, and are not common enough to be the sole power source for very large groups. If you're placing tens of thousands of people living in Cleveland you'd probably see home made wind turbines in the mix, they're relatively simple to build and Cleveland actually has quite a few wind turbines already operating within a mile or two of the lake.\n\n - By the six year mark lithium based batteries would be mostly unusable, so your characters would be using lead batteries. These are big and heavy so you can write them into small power grids and even electric vehicles if need be, but handheld devices like flashlights are pretty much out of the story unless they have a crank dynamo.\n\n - Lake Erie is relatively shallow and strong winds create waves that kick up silt. Characters that collect lake water and purify it themselves would need to cope with filtering it before boiling/drinking. If the municipal water supply is still operating you should [read this](http://www.rockthelake.com/buzz/2018/01/cleveland-water-gets-lake-erie-tap/). There is an old pumping station visible from the shore called \"the crib\" that is still in use today.\n\n - If chemicals necessary to water purification or the power needed to run large scale facilities are unavailable in your book it's feasible that people would build [slow sand water filters](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_sand_filter) to treat large amounts of water. While this method would be suitable to treat water from lake Erie our water system is not currently equipped to be supplied this way.\n\n - Modern gasoline goes bad after about a year. While it is possible to create biodiesel or fuel alcohol these processes require refining and (especially in the case of alcohol) consume potential food or animal feed. Depending on how many people are around and how much manufacturing and shipping is working in your book people would likely be switching to [wood gassification](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood_gas). Cleveland is known as the Forest City, and the city is surrounded by wooded hills. Timber would not be an *immediate* issue for your characters.\n\n - Speaking of timber, firewood cannot be simply cut down and burned (at least not well). Your characters would need to \"ring\" trees by cutting off a wide strip of bark all the way around the tree. This kills the tree, which is cut down as seasoned firewood a year or so later. The alternative is to cut and process the trees while they're geen (and therefore heavy) and stack the wood to dry.\n\n - Elsewhere in the thread you mentioned characters running the steel mill. Depending on the circumstances in your book this may not be feasible because of the raw materials and power needed. If even a large group were trying to mass produce metal products like weapons, armor, or tools they would probably be making extensive use of salvaged metal. If you decide to include the mill and neighboring Steelyard Commons shopping center (because frankly, it would make a cool setting) you should know that it isn't exactly the most defensible position. The interstate, light industrial areas, and some residential areas overlook it immediately to the North.\n\n - Northeast Ohio is surprisingly hilly for the Midwest. If you have characters moving by foot or bicycle this would be something they'd have to deal with. The terrain (as well as trees) blocks long distance visibility depending on where you are. Characters may or may not be able to spot groups moving through the region, but will get spectacular views of the city if they approach through the heights to the South.\n\n - There is an airport directly on the lakefront just East of downtown and a sizable marina just West of downtown if either of those methods of transport are still in use in your book. Barges regularly come right off the lake and into the Cuyahoga.\n\n - While there are farms around Cleveland having them operating or bringing in produce would be almost impossible pretty shortly after the disaster in your book. If the people living in Cleveland rely on these farms and it's been more than a few months since gasoline production stopped you'll need to write in wood gas vehicles. Without refrigerated shipping food availability would be largely dependent on seasonal harvests and food preservation would be a constant challenge.\n\n - People would also be growing food and raising animals in parks and backyards. Nearest to downtown the most likely suitable places for this are Edgewater park West of downtown and the back yards of nearby residential areas. The prevailing winds blow West to East, so any large scale livestock operations immediately West of downtown would create a smell that characters would notice.\n\n - Downtown itself isn't massive and access from the West is restricted by bridges across the Cuyahoga. If you wanted to write in a small police or security force building barricades and restricting access it's not impossible, but would require a city population in the tens of thousands to make construction possible. Even then characters would be reasonably able to sneak in (in small numbers) undetected.\n\n - There are several large hotels in the heart of downtown Cleveland. It's feasible to think that displaced individuals would settle there or that they'd be converted into long term housing for better security.\n\n - West Side Market is a tempting spot to write in a marketplace, but might not work in your book depending on the population and threats you write into your book. The market is in the Ohio City neighborhood West of the river. If the population was too low or the threat of attack too great a market would likely be set up in Public Square downtown.",

        "Here is info on the non-profit that that Rolling Stone chose to omit in their article:\n\n-------------------------------\nThe Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund continues to target communities in Pennsylvania and Ohio for so-called Rights of Nature initiatives aimed at banning fracking and other regulated development activities. Initiatives similar to those that have appeared in Youngstown and the Lake Erie region in Ohio, as well as Grant Township and Potter County, Pa., have been rejected by several courts and voters, and proven costly for taxpayers.\n\nHere\u2019s what Pennsylvania and Ohio residents should know about the group behind the initiatives:\n\n**What is the Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund (CELDF)?**\n\nCELDF is a nonprofit law firm based in Mercersburg, Pa., west of Gettysburg. It offers communities \u201cfree\u201d services to draft local ordinances and provide legal representation for the communities that pass them. Ordinances \u2013 which go by names such as \u201cCommunity Bill of Rights,\u201d \u201cRights of Nature,\u201d \u201cCharter amendments or home rule\u201d initiatives \u2013 often fail or end up in litigation, with the costs for either outcome falling to taxpayers in those communities. CELDF started out fighting \u201cfactory farms\u201d and has since set its sights on the oil and gas industry.\n\n**Who is CELDF?**\n\nFounder and Executive Director Thomas Linzey\u2019s agenda is based on a dismantling of private property rights, as he made clear in a 2015 speech:\n\n&gt; \u201cIf you are going to put all that work into a ballot initiative, why not do a ballot initiative that bans all finance companies in New York City from funding new projects that exasperate climate change? Why not do something real\u2026why not do something real\u2026cause people are saying to themselves, \u2018it would be illegal, it would be unlawful, it would be unconstitutional, because you are taking their property\u2019 well..(expletive), it\u2019s time.\u201d \n\nAdditionally, in 2016 Linzey told audiences in Lancaster that \u201cPennsylvania\u2019s constitution is a weapon for corporations,\u201d and that it\u2019s \u201ctime for a revolt.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s not the only extreme voice in the group. In a 2015 meeting in Youngstown, CELDF National Organizer Ben Price told attendees that \u201cwe\u2019re gonna make decisions in here that the rest of the community will just have to live with \u2026 It\u2019s how it\u2019s done!\u201d\n\nCELDF\u2019s Pennsylvania Community Organizer Chad Nicholson, who hails from Spokane, Washington, has given numerous presentations, including one titled \u201cDefying the Corporate State,\u201d to communities across Pennsylvania.  Nicholson said in 2017:\n\n&gt; \u201cLet\u2019s be clear: our state agencies, tasked with \u2018environmental protection,\u2019 are legalizing harmful activities by issuing permits to corporations with histories of violations. And, they are doing so against the will and sovereign law of the people who live in the community.\u201d\n\nAlso in 2017, Nicholson said that \u201cfrom the very beginning of this country\u2019s founding with our Constitution that was written in 1787,\u201d we \u201cdon\u2019t really have a democracy to begin with, that it\u2019s not just failing.\u201d\n\nCELDF\u2019s Board of Advisors includes Gasland director Josh Fox; Karenna Gore, who is the founding director of the Center for Earth Ethics in New York and Al Gore\u2019s wife; Rainforest Action Network founder Randy Hayes; former Pittsburgh city councilman Doug Shields; and other anti-industry activists.\n\n**CELDF\u2019s record**\n\nCELDF does not have a winning record and its desire to prolong litigation even when it knows it has no chance of winning is well documented.  In 2018, a Pennsylvania federal judge reprimanded CELDF attorneys (including its founder and executive director, Thomas Linzey) for \u201cbad faith\u201d efforts to impose a ban on an injection well in Grant Township, Indiana County. U.S. District Court Judge Susan Baxter ordered the organization to pay $52,000 in legal costs and said in her ruling:\n\n&gt;\u201cThis Court has determined that Attorneys Linzey and Dunne have pursued certain claims and defenses in bad faith. Based upon prior CELDF litigation, each was on notice of the legal implausibility of the arguments previously advanced\u2026\u201d\n\n&gt; \u201cDespite their own prior litigation, CELDF and Attorney Linzey, in particular, continue to advance discredited arguments as a basis for CELDF\u2019s ill-conceived and sponsored CBR, and in doing so have vexatiously multiplied the litigation of this matter.\u201d \n\nCELDF focuses on using litigation to drive conversation, regardless of the cost that these irresponsible cases can bring on municipalities and taxpayers. When asked about CELDF\u2019s ultimate motivation, Reuters reported:\n\n&gt; \u201cLinzey says his goal is not to write local laws that are popular, or stand up in court, but rather to trigger a public debate about community rights to local self-government \u2013 even if it means a community ultimately falls into financial ruin.\u201d\n\n**Who pays for CELDF initiatives and legal costs?**\n\nCELDF\u2019s failed initiatives have already cost taxpayers in places such as Youngstown tens of thousands of dollars. Voters in the city recently rejected a CELDF ballot initiative for the eighth time. The costs to taxpayers doesn\u2019t appear to bother Linzey, who said,\n\n&gt;\u201cIf a town goes bankrupt trying to defend one of our ordinances, well, perhaps that\u2019s exactly what is needed to trigger a national movement.\u201d \n\n**Who funds CELDF?**\n\nHow can CELDF afford such repeated failure? It\u2019s funded through foundations and private donations. They include the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, Heinz Endowments, Wallace Global Fund and others that actively support anti-fracking and anti-industry groups and initiatives.\n\n**What is a \u201crights of nature\u201d initiative?**\n\nLinzey explained the organization\u2019s \u201crights of nature\u201d movement as:\n\n&gt;\u201cWhat is increasingly growing is a realization that for a real environmental movement to occur, ecosystems must have legally enforceable rights of their own.\u201d \n\nCELDF has not been successful defending \u201crights of nature\u201d initiatives in Pennsylvania. Most recently, following CELDF\u2019s attempt to intervene in a lawsuit on behalf of the ecosystem, Judge Baxter ruled:\n\n&gt;\u201cAs to the issue of whether the Little Mahoning Watershed, an ecosystem, has standing under the law, no determination need be made here. Clear and convincing evidence has not been produced to show that [the township\u2019s] vigorous defense of the Ordinance, the terms of which protect the Watershed in all of its locations, do not line up precisely.\u201d \n\nBaxter also explained,\n\n&gt;\u201cAlthough defendant wishes it were not so, the development of oil and gas (which necessarily includes the management of waste materials generated at a well site) is a legitimate business activity and land use within Pennsylvania.\n\n&gt; \u2026\n\n&gt;\u201cThere is no state authority expressly granting a municipal government or its people the authority to regulate the depositing of waste from oil and gas wells or to invalidate permits granted by the state or federal government. Any provision enacted without underlying legislative authority is invalid and unenforceable.\u201d\n\nAs recent years have demonstrated, CELDF will continue to advance its unlawful and unconstitutional agenda so long as wealthy foundations that fund the \u201cKeep It In the Ground\u201d agenda continue to provide the means for it to do so. And given CELDF\u2019s dismal track record, taxpayers will continue to foot the bill for this folly.",

        "Lake Ontario\u2019s volume is 1,640 cubic kilometres. The area of West Virginia is 62,259 square kilometres, therefore an average of 2.6cm (~1.02 inches) would need to be taken off the top of West Virginia (1640/62259).\n\nThere are two methods for digging the channel. Firstly, there would be a Panama canal-Style model, where locks, pumps, and weirs allow different water levels to be maintained. This would cause relatively little damage to the lake ecosystems as this would mostly keep salt and freshwater separate. It would however cause significant issues regarding animal migration across the path of the canal. This, however, doesn\u2019t really need any maths. So let\u2019s assume instead that the channel is at sea level. The lakes in the way would drain away until they were at sea level. Well...\n\nThe following significant lakes are in the way, from North to south:\n- Great Bear Lake. Surface level: 156m above sea level. Maximum depth: 446m (290m below sea level). This lake would remain, albeit dramatically shrunk as sea level is below the average depth.\n- Great Slave Lake. Surface level: 156m above sea level. Maximum depth: 614m (458m below sea level). This lake would remain, albeit dramatically shrunk as sea level is below the average depth.\n- Lake Athabasca. Surface level: 213m above sea level. Maximum depth: 124m (89m above sea level). Eventually, this lake would completely drain away into the channel.\n- Wollaston Lake. Surface level: 398m above sea level. Maximum depth: 97m (301m above sea level). Eventually, this lake would completely drain away into the channel.\n- Reindeer Lake. Surface level: 337m above sea level. Maximum depth: 219m (118m above sea level). Eventually, this lake would completely drain away into the channel.\n- Cedar Lake. Surface level: 253m above sea level. Maximum depth: 10m (243m above sea level). Eventually, this lake would completely drain away into the channel.\n- Lake Winnipegosis. Surface level: 254m above sea level. Maximum depth: 19m (235m above sea level). Eventually, this lake would completely drain away into the channel.\n- Lake Winnipeg. Surface level: 217m above sea level. Maximum depth: 36m (181m above sea level). Eventually, this lake would completely drain away into the channel.\n- Lake of the Woods. Surface level: 322m above sea level. Maximum depth: 64m (258m above sea level). Eventually, this lake would completely drain away into the channel.\n- Lake Superior. Surface level (average): 183m above sea level. Maximum depth: 406m (223m below sea level). The majority of this lake would remain, although it would shrink noticeably.\n- Lake Michigan. Surface level: 176m above sea level. Maximum depth: 282m (106m below sea level). This lake would remain, albeit dramatically shrunk as sea level is below the average depth.\n- Lake Huron. Surface level: 176m above sea level. Maximum depth: 228m (52m below sea level). This lake would remain, albeit dramatically shrunk as sea level is below the average depth.\n- Lake Erie. Surface level: 174m above sea level. Maximum depth: 64m (110m above sea level). Eventually, this lake would completely drain away into the channel.\n- The lake where West Virginia is, as previously discussed, would not occur in this scheme.\n\nSo that\u2019s it! Untold devastation, several lakes gone completely, several more shrunk to a fraction of their former size, and all of them with ecosystems radically changed. Stay tuned for the edit, part 2. In which I discuss sea level, salinity, and some ball-Park averages... Where does all of the water drained out of the channels go? Well, into the oceans, of course! This next part involves a lot of guesswork and averages, I\u2019m afraid.\n\nNow, I totalled up the volume of freshwater in these lakes, as well as the water displaced from Lake Ontario, and got a figure of 26,755 cubic kilometres. I was not able to discover the volume for Lake Athabasca, Lake Winnipegosis, and Lake of the Woods, so discounted their values. This will be significant in a moment. Now, it is worth mentioning that this drainage figure includes the lakes that were not fully drained. However, it neglects to mention the smaller lakes along the route, any other water drained into it via rivers it intersects, as well as the aforementioned three lakes for which figures could be found. I believe (based on no evidence, admittedly) that these should balance each other out, creating a rough figure of around 26,750 cubic kilometres of freshwater drained into the global ocean.\n\nFirstly, what effect would this have on ocean salinity (salt content)? Well, the current average ocean salinity worldwide is around 3.5%. Not bad. The estimated volume of the ocean worldwide is 1,335,000,000 cubic kilometres. Using these two figures, there are approximately 46,725,000 kilograms of salts, mostly sodium chloride, in the global ocean right now. Adding to the ocean figure our drained lakes, and computing it out, we get a new ocean volume of 1,335,026,750 cubic kilometres. Working out from there, we have a new ocean salinity of... 3.4999%. So, in actual fact, the salinity barely changes.\n\nSecondly, what about sea level rise? Well, we know the new ocean has a volume of 26,750 cubic kilometres additionally from our lakes. The Antarctic ice sheet contains approximately 30,000,000 cubic kilometres of ice, which would melt to approximately 25,000,000 cubic kilometres of freshwater. This water would combined be enough on its own to raise sea levels worldwide by 58m, according to the latest global warming predictions. We have approximately 935x less water from our lakes than the Antarctic ice sheet, so the approximate sea level rise (very rough estimate, wrong for a number of reasons, I know) from this lake water would be 6.2cm (2.45 inches). A bit underwhelming, isn\u2019t it?\n\nSo, in conclusion, the local ecosystem would be disrupted but globally nothing much would change. And that was the end of that. \n\n(Enter climate scientist, stage left).\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, there was a project, the Atlantropa project, which aimed to drain the Mediterranean Sea. Unknown to them at the time, had they gone through with this plan, it would\u2019ve had a dramatic and significant effect on the global weather system. Large bodies of water (like the Mediterranean, or for example like certain great inland lakes) have a significant and noticeable effect on the weather systems. It is entirely possible, with the destruction or near-destruction of so many significant lakes, that the climate of the northern hemisphere as a whole could be disrupted. It\u2019s possible that parts of the region could freeze over much more viciously, or could thaw more often. This, obviously, would have massive impacts on biodiversity, agriculture, and ecosystems. Obviously, it wouldn\u2019t have as large an effect as the Mediterranean, but it would still have a significant impact.\n\nThis isn\u2019t even mentioning the spoil from digging such a channel! Assuming it was 5m deep, 10m wide, and was a (very generous) average of 20m below ground level, you\u2019d need to dig out 0.25 cubic kilometres of dirt per kilometre of route. A very rough approximation I made for the route would see it take a journey of around 5000km, meaning it would require the excavation of 1,250 cubic kilometres. Returning right to the beginning, that should be enough to refill 2.1cm of the \u201cmissing\u201d 2.6cm from West Virginia! So, all in all, the state would wind up 0.5cm, or around 0.2 inches lower than it started, you!d have destroyed several lakes, ruined ecosystems and habitats on all of local, national, and global scales, and split a continent in two, all while devastation some of nature\u2019s most iconic locations.\n\nSo yes, in theory, this plan would work. And yes, it would benefit no one and untold damage. I will now take questions.",

        "I am a little confused with these comments and I'm very curious to understand why my experience over the last few months differs. Is it my age? My job? Income? Where I live? Here is my perspective:\n\nI just moved to Windsor (Tecumseh) from the GTA, I work in the financial services sector. I'm in my 30's and a member of a visible minority. There seems to be wealth concentrated in the areas of tool &amp; die, medical professionals (dentists, etc.), real estate and as a result of intergenerational wealth transfer. \n\nWhy did I move to Windsor? Work opportunity and wanted to experience a smaller city life. Is everything going as expected? No, but I felt like I was aging way too fast with the hustle and bustle in Toronto and I'm enjoying the slower pace of life.\n\nWhat do I like about Windsor so far?\n\n\\- My commute to work in under 15 minutes in no traffic. This is compared to a roughly 2.5 hours commute daily with the drive to the GO Station, waiting for the train (sometimes delayed), getting off at Union, walking into work and repeating back home. I can't stress enough how a decade of commuting wears you down.\n\n\\- It has been an excellent winter thus far. The weather while 1-2 degrees cooler feels much milder vs. Toronto. I don't think we had snow on the ground for more than a couple of days this winter. I grew up in the Southern United States and enjoy hot climates so I don't believe the hot and humid summers I've heard about will bother me.\n\n\\- Tecumseh is very quiet and feels safe. It was weird at first, the completely silent neighborhoods. I enjoy the peace and quiet, not hearing cars driving by and other forms of noise pollution. What is surprising to me is the volume of what looks like brand new shopping centers in the Tecumseh area without the expected volume of shoppers.\n\n\\- People have been friendly and nice so far. I'm rarely tailgated and I haven't experienced road rage (a daily occurrence in the GTA).\n\n\\- You can get all of your errands done efficiently and be home without feeling stressed out. I have to stress how the lack of traffic relative to the GTA is a huge plus.\n\n\\- Small business. Whether it is buying furniture or dining, I am glad to support independent businesses. Antonino's Pizza is the best pizza I've ever had in my life. Mamo's Burger is up there and maybe my 2nd favorite behind LA's In n Out. There is surprisingly a large number of vegan/healthy eating such as Carrots n Dates, Healthy Mama, etc. The middle eastern food is delicious (Basha's and this place on Ouellette). \n\n\\- Aviation community. I earned my Private Pilot's License at the Brampton Flight Centre and it was an excellent school. Having said that it's a commercial mill with 30+ planes and a steady stream of students and congested airspace. It's the perfect hub for sightseeing (Brampton to City Tour, Lake Simcoe, Collingwood, Niagara Falls, etc.). The Windsor Flying Club with 5 planes feels like... a club. And I like that. Having said that it's been fairly boring thus far to fly around here. \n\n\\- Sightseeing and walking on nice days. My wife and I have enjoyed walking on the Riverside. We like going down to Kingsville and Amherstburg where there are cozy cafes and delicious food while walking around Lake Erie/the river. Ojibway National Park is decently scenic and you'll be able to see deer and other wildlife. There are nice dog parks around here. We haven't spent a ton of time in LaSalle or Leamington yet. We went to Belleriver once and it seems like it will be a nice vibe in the summer and a cozy town. There is history here with the American prohibition and distilleries. \n\n\\- Housing: Rent is surprisingly higher than I would have expected but I guess ownership is still much better than buying in the GTA. For $600K in Tecumseh, you will own a 2000 to 3000 square foot property. $600K in Toronto get's you a condo under 1000 sq ft (generally speaking). Utilities and other expenses seem to be lower.\n\n\\- AMERICA: This is a big one. Moving to Windsor was also my first time visiting Michigan. I grew up in America, and routinely visit New York with trips to Florida and California. The best way I can put it is that America is a different beast to Canada. It feels massive in every possible way - from the economy to industries. I have my NEXUS card and the trip to the border in 20 minutes. On the other side, you've got great sporting venues, sightseeing, restaurants, and shopping. You can just go to America if you are bored and having nothing to do ($10 dollar toll). Target, Shake Shack, Chik Fil A, Microcenter, Ford Museum, Pistons game to name a few.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do I not like about Windsor so far?\n\n\\- As others have mentioned, seeing through the economy. I get a little weirded out driving down Ouellette and seeing it underdeveloped or going one block west and seeing it much worse. It looks nice and lit up during the winter but as you look deeper you'll see empty real estate.\n\n\\- Is pollution a problem? I'm not sure but I do worry about whether you are more exposed to carcinogens here.\n\n\\- The well being of the community. It's something I care about. Clearly my feelings are not aligned the majority of the contributors to the thread below. I visited a local church and it was pretty run down. It would be great to see the community as a whole in a better economic spot and diversified. One of the reasons I moved to Windsor was that I felt incomplete in my current life. I felt that if I could somehow contribute back to a community I would be doing what I feel is natural to me. Working with people, getting my hands dirty and helping people. \n\nMaybe the allure of a small city will go away in time. But for now, I will enjoy the slower pace of life.",

        "Michigan offers Brandon Gross\n\nScholarship\n\nBrandon,\n\nThe 2048 season was a low point for Michigan basketball. Coach Tommy was gone, and there wasn\u2019t anyone ready to replace him. The Wolverines limped to an 8-23 record, and didn\u2019t come close to sniffing the NT. \n\nBut that\u2019s not the norm here at Michigan, as evidenced by the seasons sandwiching the outlier that was 2048. \n\nOf course, in 2047, we won the national championship. It may be the first time Michigan has hoisted the trophy, but it was the culmination of a rich history and tradition of Michigan basketball under Coach Tommy. Ten times he won multiple games in the NT, seven times he made the Final Four, and five times he made the championship. There are very few teams that have seen that kind of success in the NCBCA, and every single one of the accolades I just listed occured in the last 25 years. We\u2019ve made the final four more times than we\u2019ve won less than twenty games, you have a higher odds of being one of the four teams left in the country than you do failing at Michigan. There are not many other schools at all who can say that--certainly none who are offering you. There\u2019s a reason recruits are clamoring to attend a school like Michigan, they grew up watching Jerry Bryant and Paul Turner win two MVPs in the NBL each, watching freshman sensation Dennis Fernandez lead the Wolverines to the final four, watching Robert Weekley make an All-American team as he averaged 18, 6, and 4. Michigan has more memorable names than 90% of the NCBCA, and more NT success than them as well. We may not have as many National Tournament wins as Memphis or Duke, but we\u2019re much closer to them than we are to the bottom.\n\nAnd this past year, we rebounded quite nicely from 2048. In my first year as head coach, we won 19 regular season games and were comfortably in the NT picture for the entire season. Dontaveous MacLean averaged 13/5.5/5.5 en route to being a pick in the NBL draft, and the future is bright with returners like Maurice Milton and Nate Wright, two players who were Top 30 in last year\u2019s recruiting rankings. I brought Michigan back into immediate contention, and it\u2019ll only get better from here. I took the coaching job right before the recruiting season, I had to scramble and sign six graduate and JUCO transfers, and I had to fill all 8 scholarship spots. This year, I\u2019m ready to jump right in and build a team that can contend for a championship. I\u2019m targeting 5-star players, other high 4-stars, and of course yourself, and am striving to bring in a group of players with diverse skill sets that can bring us another National Championship. After my first year at Gonzaga, I didn\u2019t dip back under the twenty-win mark, and I\u2019m by all measures ahead at Michigan compared to where I was at Gonzaga at this point in my tenure. I won an NT game more often than I didn\u2019t, making the Elite Eight multiple times. When you combine my coaching prowess with the University of Michigan, who knows how high we can climb? After all, UM has the resources of a large public school, much more than those of Gonzaga. The Big North is a competitive league, but I relish the competition, I want to beat the best. The Big North is the best, and we\u2019ve climbed that mountain many times, why don\u2019t you help us do it again?\n\nAnd with such a rich history comes a rich NBL tradition. 45 players drafted into the NBL, 25 first rounders, 14 lottery picks. 4 players inducted into the NBL HOF. And I myself have sent 17 players into the NBL over 9 seasons coached at Gonzaga, almost two per year. At the guard position, Paul Turner and Jerry Bryant both sported the block M and won two MVPs each, while Joshea Allen was a disciple of mine who just averaged a double double as a PG and signed a deal worth north of 20M/year. On the wing, Robert Weekley is tearing up the NBL, scoring 20 PPG every season now, and my first five-star recruit was Legerald Smith, who made the  All-Rookie team and was a stud defensively. BIgs, there are plenty, from Michael Barrows and Bruce Smith at Michigan to Coban DeLaurier at Gonzaga. But you specifically remind me of a player I recruited in 2039, who is still in the NBL and thriving today. Isaac Bowman was a raw player in high school, mainly relying on his athletic traits to get the job done. That\u2019s why he was only rated as the 75th overall recruit. But I saw potential in Issac, just like I see in you. He worked to round out his game and add skill after skill, and became the NCBCA DPOY in his junior season. But NBL teams still weren\u2019t convinced, he was drafted with the 40th overall pick in the draft after he declared early. But he kept working, using the skills that I had taught him, and now he\u2019s made six All-Defensive Teams, made an All-Star Game, won two NBL championships, and made over 140 MILLION dollars in his career. You\u2019re a lot like Isaac, Brandon, and I can help you unlock your untapped potential. \n\nAnd the best part is all of this comes in a package under an hour away from your hometown of Detroit. The drive is extremely manageable--I end up going to the city on many weekends for scouting purposes, and I have enough time to drive down, do a whole day's work, and return home over the course of around twelve hours. Plus, even though we\u2019re not technically called the land of ten thousand lakes, we\u2019ve got no shortage around here. Lake Erie and Lake St. Clair are the two big ones, less than an hour drive, but I don\u2019t think I need to tell you that, they\u2019re basically in Detroit! Those two are great, one is even \u201cGreat\u201d, but directly in the town we have even more intimate spots to offer. First and Second SIster Lakes, Bandemer Park ,and the Huron River that runs directly through our town. We\u2019re not the land of ten thousand lakes, but we are the town of one hundred. \n\nGo Blue!\n\nWC: 1062",

They remain totally unexplained.\n\nIn every eyewitness or first-hand report like this, especially a long-private and still-anonymous family experience\u2014there will be commenters who trot out the usual \"it's such-and-such secret craft,\" or something ridiculous like \"it's a stealth bomber\" (which would blow everybody's ear drums apart if it was for some reason strafing a suburban neighborhood). For nearly 50 years I've heard claims that the triangles are a \"secret craft.\" Yet many thousands of people have seen them, around the world. Secret craft aren't hovering over American suburban houses\u2014there's a reason the US government owns most of Nevada and eastern California: that's where secret craft fly, so if they crash the \"secret\" isn't front-page news around the world with dead suburban families.\n\nThese mysterious craft\u2014we call them craft, and we have no idea what they *really* are\u2014share some commonalities: They are always absolutely silent, although some witnesses feel a vibration which could be a clue to their weird origin. They appear in the most mundane places, such as over country back roads, golf courses at night, suburban cul-de-sacs. They are almost always described as \"eerie,\" or \"sinister,\" or \"baffling.\" The size is generally *absurd:* \"football-field in width\" is a common measurement, because most everybody grasps the immense size of a football field, and how bizarre it would be to see such a vast shape gliding in utter silence at very low altitude. Sometimes they hover in place. The bottom surface is often described as glossy, glassy, or even translucent: Witnesses often report being able to *see the stars through the massive shape*. Rarely does anyone see more than the bottom of the thing, but when the \"triangles\" pivot in place in the sky, as they sometimes do, there is a sense that the shape is three-dimensional, a pyramid or a diamond shape.\n\nFrom Lake Erie to the Hudson Valley, there have been countless sightings of such huge, silent things low in the sky. Here are a few National UFO Reporting Center files from 1980s Ohio. Of course distance doesn't matter to these things: They appear and disappear at will. But they also have a habit of appearing in the same areas for sometimes a decade at a time, as in the case of the Hudson Valley Boomerang. Even though so many people see these things, the reports tend to vanish and exist only as family lore or dusty newspaper clippings in a local library. There is no national database of sightings, none that has been made public anyway. As there is no explanation for these massive sky-shapes, \"researching\" ultimately leads to the dead end of data with no direction. Enjoy the family memory. Your family saw something awesome, and what people used to call \"divine.\"\n\n[http://nuforc.org/webreports/080/S80250.html](http://nuforc.org/webreports/080/S80250.html)\n\n[http://nuforc.org/webreports/078/S78970.html](http://nuforc.org/webreports/078/S78970.html)\n\n[http://nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61133.html](http://nuforc.org/webreports/061/S61133.html)\n\n[http://nuforc.org/webreports/075/S75605.html](http://nuforc.org/webreports/075/S75605.html)\n\n[http://nuforc.org/webreports/052/S52968.html](http://nuforc.org/webreports/052/S52968.html)\n\n[http://nuforc.org/webreports/077/S77232.html](http://nuforc.org/webreports/077/S77232.html)\n\n[http://nuforc.org/webreports/052/S52001.html](http://nuforc.org/webreports/052/S52001.html)\n\nAnd they still appear today.

        "I know this is a turn-based thing, but in the long run, here\u2019s how I can see this turning out:\n\nTo start, we would have to establish different cultural zones based on climate and geography.\n\nAs previously mentioned, there would be three places agriculture (and therefore the first civilizations) would likely arise: the Andes, Meso-America, and the Mississippi basin.\n\nTo start, Andean civilization is the easiest, and would be most similar to its IRL counterpart in human Andean civilization. Most of the megafauna the artifexes would have that the Native Americans did not have were found in North America, so once again the Andeans would just have their llamas and alpacas. As the map indicates, they would also have an abundance of natural resources, meaning they could easily enter into the bronze and iron ages on their own. Being high up in the mountains and away from the coast, it\u2019s unlikely they would have much contact with other civilizations primarily in North America. Perhaps if an Amazonian civilization arose like OTL, they would have some contact. However, OTL the reason indigenous people survived in the Amazon is because the jungle didn\u2019t have the same tropical diseases that they had in Africa, and once African slaves were brought to the Americas, the Amazonian civilizations died out. Therefore, with Artifexes having evolved in South America, it\u2019s less likely they will be immune to the diseases that evolved alongside them. The Andeans would therefore likely stay up in the mountains, forming various city states that would sometimes rise up into larger kingdoms and empires like OTL. The Andeans would likely be the only major South American civilization.\n\nThe civilizations of North America would be different. Both Mesoamerica and Mississippi would have access to a wide variety of megafauna. Horse and camel nomads from the Great Plains and northern Mexico would likely constantly pose threats to the nearby civilizations. The Mississippian civilization would therefore be primarily concentrated in the wooded areas of the basin. This area would have little geographic barriers and would be heavily connected by rivers. This area I would expect to most closely resemble ancient China, although not as large. OTL, the Mississippi basin is I believe the largest continuous stretch of arable land in the world, and it would be able to boast a large continuous population that would likely form a common culture through periods of unification and division under warlords. They would also be susceptible to nomadic invasions from the west. The most powerful cities would likely be at key points in the river system, such as areas corresponding with OTL New Orleans, St. Louis / Cahokia, Memphis, or perhaps some more carefully built city near the site of Cairo, Illinois. It would likely be near one of these areas that agriculture begins, and from there it would be easy to conquer and assimilate the rest of the area. The region would also likely include parts of the Gulf Coast, such as Alabama and parts of the Texan coast. It would likely be bounded by the Great Plains to the west, the Appalachians to the east, the Great Lakes to the north, and the Gulf of Mexico to the south.\n\nTo the east of the Appalachians, would be the eastern Seaboard. It\u2019s possible that this region might be controlled by Mississippi, either through direct control by various empires or through vassals and client kingdoms, although the Seaboard would likely at the very least maintain a distinct identity while also heavily adopting elements of Mississippian culture. With its abundance of natural ports due to the unending chain of barrier islands, it would likely develop a seafaring culture, and powerful cities would likely pop up around ports and particularly near the mouths of rivers. I could easily see key cities spring up where they did OTL in the northeast, with perhaps a few more, such as perhaps by the mouth of the Potomac and the mouth of the Connecticut river. I could easily see a civilization with the OTL Lenape\u2019s territory, controlling the areas around both the Delaware river and the mouth of the Hudson, becoming quite dominant in the area. The coastal kingdoms would push inland against the Appalachian in order to protect themselves from attacks from the west, or perhaps it might be Appalachian people who push east to the coast. Either way, these civilizations would likely be anchored between the coast and the Appalachians, with people fighting for control of the coasts. The north and south of the Seaboard would likely develop quite differently, although both would likely have large coastal ports with plenty of inland fortresses. Florida would likely not become so developed because of the swampy territory and would provide a barrier between the cultures of the southern Seaboard and the Gulf Coast, the latter of which would most likely be dominated by Mississippi. Alabama would likely become an area where the southern Seaboard and Mississippi meet, bu the more powerful united Mississippians would dominate the area. The barriers of the Seaboard area would be Florida and the gulf to the south, the Appalachians to the west, the St. Lawrence to the north, and the Atlantic to the east. The northernmost parts, such as New England and the Maritimes, would likely be the most free of Mississippian influence. The Middle portion would reach south to the middle of Virginia, and then the southernmost parts would have the most Mississippian influence. I also imagine that the southern Seaboardians may establish colonies in the Caribbean, and bronze would likely first be developed in Nova Scotia before being traded with the rest of the continent, making Nova Scotia quite rich early on.\n\nTo the north of the Mississippians would be the Great Lakes. The Great Lakes, like the Seaboard, would be heavily influenced by Mississippi culture. Without the separation of the mountains, there would be more of an attempt by Mississippi to directly conquer these areas. However, the geography of the lakes would partially shield them, giving those particularly north and east of the lakes more freedom. The lakes would likely include independent kingdoms, and Mississippian vassals. I could easily see a city existing neat Chicago on Lake Michigan close to the source of the Illinois River, which would connect it to Mississippi. Chicago would be a key spot for the projection of Mississippian influence into the Great Lakes. I could also see cities popping up at key points in the lakes, such as near Detroit, the northern tip of Michigan\u2019s mitten, the eastern tip of the upper peninsula, the western shores of Lake Ontario near Toronto, and the eastern shores of Lake Erie near Buffalo. Perhaps London, Ontario or somewhere else near the center of the Ontario Peninsula may also be a useful spot to control and could potentially be the center of a major power on the lakes. The people of Upstate New York, corresponding with the OTL Iroquois, would be at the eastern end of this region and likely have some influence from the Northern Seaboard across the Appalachians. Later down the line, I could also see plenty of wars occurring in Wisconsin and Minnesota over their iron.",

        "**London Calling** - a world where global oil reserves ran dry in 2021 in an event known as the Shortage, triggering societal collapse.    \n    \nLeft to right, top to bottom: \n    \n- **Creative Reenactment Society**    \n    \n - Government: Constitutional Monarchy    \n    \n - Head of State: King Francis I    \n    \n - Region: Pennsylvania and the Boston-Washington Corridor    \n    \n - Captial: Erie, Pennsylvania    \n    \n - Population: ~30 million    \n    \n -  Lore: Colloquially known as the East Kingdom, the CRS is no doubt the strangest state to arise in the wake of the Shortage. It was founded in 1966 as a living history organisation, but with the Shortage members found their skills at combat and pre-industrial craftwork in high demand. The CRS formally declared itself a nation under Queen Eliza I in December 2021, and has gone on to dominate the northeast while retaining its unique anachronistic culture and traditions; most famously, it maintains a corps of knights in full plate armour who serve as shock troops with modern weapons. In 2032 it became a founding member of the Northeast Coalition, an alliance of democratic states in the region dedicated to free trade and mutual defence.\n    \n- **Toronto**    \n    \n - Government: Unicameral Parlimentary Republic    \n    \n - Head of State: Mayor Catherine Lambert    \n    \n - Region: Toronto, Ontario    \n    \n - Capital: Toronto, Ontario    \n    \n - Population: ~2.5 million    \n    \n - Lore: Officially the Republic of Toronto, the city weathered the Shortage far better than other cities on the Great Lakes, and transitioned rapidly into a city-state as the Canadian government collapsed. Toronto is known for strong welfare and its public transport system, but those outside the city often see it as a domineering force on the Great Lakes thanks to its harsh tarriffs on imports from outside of the Northeast Coalition (which it was a founding member of) and its total naval control of Lake Ontario.\n    \n- **Commonwealth of Atlantic Canada**\n    \n - Government: Federal Republic    \n    \n - Head of State: Premier Rachel Dubois    \n    \n - Region: Canadian Maritimes    \n    \n - Capital: Halifax, Nova Scotia    \n   \n - Population: ~1.6 million    \n    \n - Lore: Long suffering economic decline, the Canadian Maritimes have seen a reversal of fortune now that the dust of the Shortage has settled. The Commonwealth is a manufacturing hub within the Coalition, benefitting greatly from free trade and free from international competition, and Halifax is home to some of the region's most well-regarded shipyards. The Commonwealth joined the Coalition in 2051, though its alliance with Newfoundland dates back to the early months of the new world.    \n    \n- **Newfoundland**    \n    \n - Government: Confederal Semi-Direct Democracy    \n    \n - Head of State: Premier Mary Davis    \n    \n - Region: Newfoundland    \n    \n - Capital: St. John's, Newfoundland    \n    \n - Population: ~490,000\n    \n - Lore: In the immediate wake of the Shortage, the people of Newfoundland banded together to get by. Well into the 2030s the island was divided between dozens of independent towns and local republics, and the people weren't eager to give up that freedom. Unification finally came peacefully in 2041, though the various town-states of the island retained most of their independence. The national government today exists largely to manage international relations and the island's small military contribution to the Coalition, leaving most lawmaking powers in the hands of town meetings.\n    \n- **Haudenosaunee**    \n    \n - Government: Confederation of Tribal Councils    \n    \n - Head of State: Chief Craig Hill    \n    \n - Region: Southern Golden Horseshoe, Ontario    \n    \n - Capital: Brantford, Ontario    \n    \n - Population: ~62,000    \n    \n - Lore: The Six Nations Reserve in Southern Ontario regained sovereignty for the first time in centuries thanks to the Shortage; Toronto recognised it in 2029, and it became a founding member of the Northeast Coalition. Joined by an influx of Six Nations people from across the Northeast, the new state has seen rapid growth and strong influence thanks to having ports on both Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. Despite this growth, the Haudenosaunee still relies on its traditional methods of governance, with Council Fires responsible for legislative decisions.     \n     \n- **Five Star Alliance**    \n    \n - Government: Loose Alliance of States    \n    \n - Head of State: President Randall McClain    \n    \n - Region: Chicago and surroundings    \n    \n - Capital: Chicago, Illinois\n    \n - Population: ~1.2 million    \n    \n - Lore: The city of Chicago has not seen stability since the Shortage; while it never saw the total abandonment that befell Detroit, many fled the city as a decade of anarchy was followed by the rise and fall of multiple regimes. The Alliance is the latest, formed in 2070 by the various factions of the city in the hopes of profiting off the booming Lakes Trade. Infighting and disagreement still hinders the rebuilding of the city, and many wonder how long this latest attempt at governance will last.     \n     \n- **F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise**    \n    \n - Government: Socialist One-Party State    \n    \n - Head of State: President Marie Archambault    \n    \n - Region: Southern Quebec &amp; Ottawa    \n    \n - Capital: Quebec City, Quebec\n    \n - Population: ~7.9 million    \n    \n - Lore: The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise was born from revolution, as the provincial government of Quebec's increasingly draconian attempts to maintain order in the face of the Shortage boiled over. Four years of fighting followed, ending with the establishment of the Federation in 2026. The resulting state is strongly left-wing and fiercely isolationist, with its relationship with the Northeast Coalition marked by sabre-rattling and gunboat diplomacy. Despite missing out on the lucrative trade that would likely come with opening the St. Lawrence Seaway, the Federation remains self-sufficient.     \n     \n- **Calgary**    \n    \n - Government: Unicameral Presidential Republic    \n    \n - Head of State: Mayor William Sanberth    \n    \n - Region: Calgary, Alberta    \n    \n - Capital: Calgary, Alberta\n    \n - Population: ~0.5 million    \n    \n - Lore: Devastated by the collapse of the oil industry and isolated in the relative north, Calgary has nonetheless stubbornly held on as a city-state. Supported by a renewed agricultural industry and widespread material harvesting from the ruins of Edmonton, the city is the largest supplier of biofuels in North America and is beginning to bounce back after decades of hardship. During the winter, however, Calgary becomes almost entirely cut-off as the trade routes that connect it to Cascadia are blocked by snow; only a few freeroaders, lead by the legendary *Northstar*, make the treacherous 'Bertha Drive' to keep the city supplied in the cold.",

        "It's a bit more complex than this post is implying.  \n\nFirstly, while surface water follows surface topography and thus can be delineated into \"watersheds\", underground is a lot more complex. Guelph and Nestle both pull from the Gasport aquifer, deep underground. In Guelph, if you were to dig down, you would dig through a series of soil and rock layers of variable permeability in roughly this order (going by memory): about a foot of black topsoil, and then brown sandy/rocky subsoil down to a grey-colored dolostone called the Guelph formation. As you might expect, the subsoil is quite permeable but the rock of the Guelph formation is much less so. There are many wells, mostly abandoned and forgotten, which are dotted throughout the city and surrounding area that tap this Guelph aquifer but they're typically only 20-30 feet down. \n\nKeep digging and you'll come to a light tan to cream-coloured stone called the Eramosa formation. Most of the downtown bulidings are made from this stone; it's the formation that eroded into the Rockwood caves. Beneath this is the Goat Island formation, a tight-formed, low-permeability rock. It's not always present (this depends on the contours of the Gasport formation below) but where it is, it mostly prevents water from percolating through. And below that is, of course, the Gasport formation from which most of Guelph's (and Nestle's) water supply is drawn. At the base of the Gasport formation is the Rochester formation which is impermeable. Wells drilled through the Rochester formation are few, and either \"brine\" (salt) or \"sour\" (sulfur/natural gas).\n\nSo what does that mean for water? There are three factors that affect the groundwater levels in the Gasport aquifer: the permeability of the rocks, the contours of the long-buried valleys, and the production of nearby wells. Guelph is situated above a unique type of landform called \"karst\" -- over millions of years, the limestones that make up the Guelph, Eramosa and Gasport rock formations have been cracked by seismic activity, letting water infiltrate. Water dissolves the calcium and magnesium that make up these limestones, widening the cracks and creating a deep, interconnected system of underground caverns. These caverns are visible on the surface at Rockwood, but wind their way deep underground. Some have been refilled with dirt and sand, and some are just full of water. This is why Guelph is such a productive location for groundwater -- the wells recharge quickly, because the ground is porous.\n\nHowever, \"quickly\" is still only true over long time scales. In free-flowing aquifers, groundwater percolates horizontally at a rate of feet per hour; other sources, like the Ogallala aquifer underlying most of the American west, recharges at a rate of feet per year. As a result, groundwater isn't like a lake finding its own level, it instead follows the contours of those buried valleys. In the Gasport formation, the general slope is NW -&gt; SE towards Lake Erie, generally due to a deep crustal feature called the Algonquin Arch upon which the southern Ontario peninsula sits. This means that any wells to the \"northwest\" will have a greater effect on wells to the \"southeast.\" \n\nThe water level in wells is also affected by nearby wells, for reasons that should now be obvious. When you draw water out of one spot in the aquifer, you create a \"depression\" in the water level, which causes nearby water to flow towards your well. As nearby water flows towards your well, nearby wells will see a drop in their level. \n\nSo what does this mean for us? Nestle's well is rated to pump 1200 gallons per minute (per the original well record) and I believe their permit to take water allows them about 400. Drawing 400 gallons a minute from the aquifer inevitably creates a depression surrounding their well that affects other wells. Nestle's well is \"downstream\" from ours because they are southeast of Guelph -- but their pumping means water is drawn to the area, lowering water levels out to an unknown distance away. As one example, the portion of the aquifer underlying southwest Guelph is well-known to be very permeable -- pumping at the Queensdale well or at the Dolime Quarry has been observed to drop water levels at Downey about 4 km away.\n\nOur nearest production wells are the Burke well at Arkell Rd near Summerfield (7km north) and the Downey well (8km northwest). It also affects Guelph's future water supply plans: there is currently a plan on the books to drill a major supply well (over 700 gallons per minute) at the intersection of Maltby and Victoria -- less than 4 km from the Nestle site, and chosen because it \"overlays an area with high transmissivity\" in the Gasport formation. (Of the many possible future groundwater supplies for Guelph, this one is the least expensive per pumped gallon of water and therefore the best option for our expansion.)\n\nTo summarize: it's not really true to say that Nestle and Guelph's water supply are in different \"subwatersheds.\" The underlying rock formations do not care about the surface topography. Due to the karst underlying the city, water that enters at our surface will percolate downwards through caves and fissures, recharging the Guelph aquifer at the surface but will also transit the Eramosa formation into the lower Gasport formation from which both Guelph and Nestle draw. That karst is why we have such a good groundwater system, but because of its high permeability, pumping in one well can significantly affect pumping in other wells.\n\n--\n\nIf you want to know all about the rocks in this area, I recommend reading [this article.](https://www.grandriver.ca/en/our-watershed/resources/Documents/Groundwater/Watershed-Geology_March272019.pdf) (It's what I read to refresh myself on the most up-to-date terminology -- we used to call the Gasport aquifer the Amabel aquifer and you might still see that name.) And if you're interested in where all those wells were and are, [Ontario makes that data public.](https://www.ontario.ca/environment-and-energy/map-well-records) You can find all the records of any well -- drinking wells, test wells, failed boreholes -- that they know about. Including, often, the actual original document filed by the well driller. I used it to pull the Nestle well among others. Finally, I pulled most of my knowledge about Guelph system out of the [Water Supply Master Plan,](https://guelph.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014-Water-Supply-Master-Plan-Update.pdf) including well locations, pumping amounts, background knowledge, and future plans.",

        "This is absurd but probably not in the top five most despicable thing Ohio Republicans have done this year. \n\n&gt;Local governments could not ban plastic bags under a measure approved Wednesday by the Ohio House.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Ohio House again has waded into local decision-making, forbidding cities and counties from imposing bans on the use of plastic bags by grocery stores, restaurants and other retailers.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Republican-dominated chamber voted 57-35 on Wednesday afternoon to approve [**House Bill 242**](https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/legislation-summary?id=GA133-HB-242), sending the heavily debated measure to the Senate for consideration.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The bill sponsor, Rep. Don Jones, R-Freeport, said business groups, grocers and retail merchants object to local prohibitions of plastic bags, saying they would impose a business-unfriendly patchwork of varying regulations across the state.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Other lawmakers pointed out that businesses increasingly are becoming environmentally conscious \u2014 such as Kroger saying it will stop use of plastic bags by 2025 \u2014 and such bans are unneeded.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Republican Gov. Mike DeWine and local officials oppose the bill on grounds that it runs afoul of the Ohio Constitution\u2019s grant of home-rule authority to local governments. DeWine also has expressed alarm at the impact of plastics on the environment.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The Columbus suburb of Bexley and Cuyahoga County have approved pending plastic bag bans, saying they would divert single-use plastic from the waste stream and encourage use of reusable bags and more environmentally friendly paper bags.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Citing plastic pollution choking Lake Erie, Rep. Kent Smith, D-Euclid, said local leaders deserve to be allowed to craft solutions that best serve their communities, including measures to protect the environment.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The legislation also would forbid local bans of other single-use containers and plastic straws and the imposition of government fees on such items.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Pending [**Senate Bill 222**](https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/legislation-summary?id=GA133-SB-222) also would [**prohibit local governments from imposing bans on plastic bags**](https://www.dispatch.com/news/20191205/dewine-opposes-moves-by-lawmakers-to-forbid-local-bans-on-plastic-bags).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The House also voted 79-13 to pass [**House Bill 144**](https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/legislation-summary?id=GA133-HB-144) to prohibit hospitals from requiring nurses to work overtime as a condition of continued employment. It also advances to the Senate.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The bill would bar hospitals from firing nurses or taking disciplinary action against them for refusing to work overtime shifts except when required by health care emergencies or to complete ongoing patient procedures.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[***rludlow@dispatch.com***](mailto:rludlow@dispatch.com)\n\nWhat are your top five stupid things Ohio Republicans have done this year?

You just are clearly ignorant on how large bodies of water affect climate.\n\nWe on the North Shore of Lake Ontario and Lake Erie in Southern Ontario have a more temperate climate and less snowfall than New York State along the southern shores of those massive lakes.\n\nAnd New York City is on the Ocean which also massively affects the climate.\n\nLet me give you the data to clear away your ignorance.\n\nToronto which is on the North Shore of Lake Ontario has an [average max and min temp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto#Climate) (Celsius) of\n\nNov. +8 to +2\n\nDec. +2 to -3\n\nJan. -1 to -7\n\nFeb. 0 to -6\n\nMar. 5 to -2\n\nAnd an [average snowfall](https://www.currentresults.com/Weather/Canada/Ontario/Places/toronto-snowfall-totals-snow-accumulation-averages.php) of (30 cm is a foot)\n\nNov. 8 cm\n\nDec. 24 cm\n\nJan. 37 cm\n\nFeb. 27 cm\n\nMar.  20 cm\n\nSo yes we get a little snow on average in Nov, but it is uncommon and never stays due to the above freezing temperature.

        "&lt;&lt;SORRY, THIS IS EXTREMELY LONG&gt;&gt; \nOkay, here goes.  TLDR at the bottom!\n\nI live in Ohio so it isn't uncommon for my camping trips to take me up to lake Erie. There are a few \"unowned\" (privatised and insecure) islands that adventurous campers like myself like to stay at (fun? Yes! Illegal? ...maybe). One of them is pretty small, you can walk along the entire shore of the island in around or less than an hour. It was on my first trip to this island that I had this encounter.\n\nI had carefully kayaked from a cast off site from the mainland for maybe an hour or so to get to this island that a local relative had told me about. Decades ago when her town was small and quaint (still kind of is) and everyone knew each other, she told me about one of her friends who had been to this island (that was before it was claimed by someone, dude who owns it doesn't really give a shit about it now AFAIK.) Apparently there was something-something about animals bothering him in the night, but my relative claimed that everybody had it twisted into some kind of urban legend when in reality it was probably just raccoons. Long story short, nobody local really goes or went there, and people who aren't from around there don't know about it. It remains undeveloped to this day, besides a small amateur pier.\n\nI won't bore you with the details, but I set up my tent and a fire and had some food and some drinks. It was like over an hour before I estimated it was going to get dark (I camp pretty primitively if I'm solo) so I figured I would explore into the center of the island before snuggling into bed with a book. My plan was set and off I went. I didn't take anything really besides like a machete, a small camera (like a digital one), and a walking stick because I (pretty rightfully) assumed you can basically see through the trees to the lake even if you're in the center. If not, I'd just walk forward long enough until I reached the shore and made it back to the pier (where my campsite was near.)\n\nYou might be able to see where this is going. I just sort of trampled into the woods carelessly (not my greatest idea.) I think in theory it would take 10 or so minutes of hiking to get to the middle. I was walking for a hot second when I saw a large mass some yards ahead of me. If you've listened to that ranger story, you may remember the part where he mentions that straight lines do not occur often, if at all, in nature. I was not initially very alarmed because I knew it wasn't an animal, and figured there must have been a structure here from back in the day. Old revolution-age buildings are often scattered around near water in Ohio. Being an amateur urbex-er myself my interest was piqued and I made my way over, with plenty of daytime and only a very slight buzz from dinner.\n\nThis is the part where shit gets a little weird.\n\nI approach this structure, an old stone staircase with relatively small and misshapen steps. It was entirely old weathered stone, I assume it wasn't hollow on the inside. It was like, 10x10 feet maybe? There were two graffiti's (grammar? Idk) on it. One very tiny nearly illegible one carved in (some variant of _____ was here), and a faint spray paint on the front that said \"J + K.\" The surrounding area had saplings and copious shrubbery instead of thick and old trees. I investigated the surrounding area before the stairs itself. There was no remnant of any previous structure. No walls, debris, bricks, etc. It struck me as really odd, but I supposed that maybe the rest of the house was entirely wood or something (NOT A HISTORICAL CONSTRUCTION EXPERT!) I carefully investigated the stairs and found those graffiti's. There was an ashy area a few yards away where I assume someone had camped before.\n\nAt this point I didn't really feel anything odd, just like a bit puzzled by the lack of any other remnant architecture. I noticed it getting a bit darker so I was like \"hell yea gonna go back to the tent and read a book\" when all of a sudden I just got like, this horrible wave of anxiety. Maybe you won't get this, but you know when you turn the lights off before getting in bed, and you're just like not thinking anything cause you're a normal person, but then you start to hype yourself up like \"EE MONSTERS GOING TO GRAB MY FEET FROM UNDER THE BED\" so you just feel this rush of adrenaline into your chest and you just DIVEBOMB into your bed for protection? No? Just me? Well anyway, that's how I felt. It was a childish excitement and fear that just made me want to jump and run back where I came, not necessarily _away_ from anything. Then I thought about the stairs. And I just like. Turned around slowly, feeling like there was _something_ there. I looked at them. I started to like...get this mental fog. It happened a long time ago during another possible paranormal experience. It was like a wave of indifference and curiosity washed over me and I had this compulsion to go to them. \n\nI drifted over to the bottom, staring at the top. I was staring like a zombie, slowly walking up two steps at a time. I felt catatonic. I felt so out of it, so mentally blank, like something in me completely took over and just acted out primal steps. I was 3/4 up when I snapped out of it and I FUCKING _RAN_. I ran as fast as I could, I felt so scared like in my chest and I was tearing up, I was running for my god damn life. It was getting really dark even though I had only been there for what I thought was half an hour. My brain was filled with thoughts of \"oh my god. What the fuck.\" Looping over and over. As I was running I must have gotten lost or turned around somehow, and after a few minutes I was back at the stairs. It was dark now. I can't explain to you how much this made me freak out. I flipped my shit. I ran away, sobbing. I'm tearing up now thinking about the fear those stupid fucking stairs gave me. I somehow beelined it back to the tent this time despite my first mixup.\n\n I didn't know how I could sleep, I though about packing up my tent and kayaking home, but it was way too dark and dangerous for that, and the water had gotten a little choppy. I decided I would move my tent right next to the pier, not caring if coast guard or whatever saw me and got me in trouble. I just wanted to be out of that forest. \n\nShit got even weirder.\n\nI laid in bed with all of the protective flaps off so I could see as much around me as possible. I started to calm down and think about how I just scared myself, like with the monsters under the bed thing, and I was being ridiculous, and I would just leave in the morning. I took my mind off of it with my book. The sound of the waves allowed me to drift to sleep as I felt much safer being away from those stairs.\n\n30 minutes before daybreak I woke up in a cold sweat. It happens, I thought, and tried to go back to sleep. I hear scraping of nylon, and I sit up with a jolt and grab my massive knife with one hand and my flashlight in the other. I make a stupid caveman noise to try and scare off whatever animal it might be. I turn on the flashlight and look around my tent. And there I see it.\n\nOr rather, there I DONT see it. There was nothing there. Nothing. The scraping continued after a few seconds. I got out in a panic and I trade in for my sharper machete. I circle the tent, it continues. I walk around and this fucking freaked me OUT. I saw the indentations of a finger, claw, prodding-device, moving down my tent near the bottom. It scrapes three times quickly and stops. It's like I'm seeing an invisible something scrape at my tent from the outside. Fight or flight kicks in and I yell and run and kick something that isn't there. My foot doesn't make contact with anything and I stumble backwards. I jump around and squeak and tear up and I feel that childish fear I felt earlier. I repeat \"whathafuck!!!!\" Out loud and just fucking pack up everything as fast as possible, skipping my typical storage-saver folding routine and shove everything into a big garbage bag and strap it on the back of the kayak. I'm fucking out, don't even bother to erase evidence that I've been there. I paddle back as the sun begins to rise and I put that island behind me. I am NOT going to investigate this. \n\nOn the bright side, the paddle back was serene!\n\nOn the bad side, I did go back.\n\nI'll make it quick. I brought my friend who pressured me into going after convincing me I was insane.  We looked for the stairs and couldn't find them on this little island, scouring the entire thing. Nothing weird happened in the night. I would know, because I didn't sleep a wink. I don't think I'll go back.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013-\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013-\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013-\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013-\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013-\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013-\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013-\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013-\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013-\n\nTL;DR: I go to an abandoned island, find a set of stairs, get mind-controlled into walking up them and then get REALLY SCARED, and run to my tent. Then see an invisible man scratching at my tent and promptly GTFO. Return next season and find that there is nothing there, and nothing interesting happens.",

        "Continuation of the Browns non-fan edition. Here is the roster predictions and analysis, as well as schedule predictions and final thoughts. \n\nProjected Starting Lineup\n\nQB: Baker Mayfield\n\nRB: Nick Chubb\n\nWR: Odell Beckham, Jarvis Landry, Antonio Callaway\n\nTE: David Njoku\n\nOL: Greg Robinson, Joel Bitonio, JC Tretter, Austin Corbett, Chris Hubbard\n\nDL: Myles Garrett, Sheldon Richardson, Larry Ogunjobi, Olivier Vernon\n\nLB: Christian Kirksey, Joe Schobert, Genard Avery\n\nDB: Denzel Ward, Greedy Williams, Damarious Randall, Morgan Burnett\n\nST: Greg Joseph, Britton Colquitt, Jarvis Landry\n\nBrowns Position Groups:\n\nQB: The Browns have one of the best young QBs in the league in Baker, and he\u2019ll only improve this season. Outside of him, they have reliable veteran Drew Stanton. Grade: A+\n\nRB: This might be the league\u2019s best RB core on paper. Nick Chubb, Kareem Hunt, and Duke Johnson are all very talented young backs. The only thing that hurts them right now is Hunt\u2019s suspension and Duke possibly wanted to be traded. Grade: A-\n\nWR: As most know, one of the biggest moves of the whole offseason was the Odell Beckham trade. This boosters the core and helps the team out, as Jarvis Landry can now be a true slot next to his best friend. However, after them there are some solid players but no big name talent, which is the only downside. Grade: B+\n\nTE: The Browns have reliable TEs in David Njoku and Demetrius Harris, but both will need to step up for the offense this year. Grade B\n\nOL: The Browns O-Line has quietly been going downhill for years, and the Zeitler trade makes me question how well Baker will be protected and if the run game will really be great. Joe Bionto and JC Tretter are both good players, but the rest aren\u2019t on their level. I hope I\u2019m proven wrong and they do well. Grade: C+ \n\nDL: This is the Browns best defensive unit, and probably their best that has multiple players. Myles Garrett is an absolute beast. Sheldon Richardson is a very good DT and will help the interior. Oliver Vernon and Larry Ogunjobi both should eat next to these two. The only question is if Vernon will be better or worse than Emmanuel Ogbah. Grade: A+ \n\nLB: The LBs are a mix between talented starters and next man up depth. Guys like Christian Kirksey and Joe Schobert will Do well, but others need to step up. This is probably the weakest defensive spot. Grade: B-\n\nDB: This is another talent defensive unit. CBs Denzel Ward and Greedy Williams are young and talented, and have solid safeties in Morgan Burnett and Damarious Randall to help them out. Grade: A\n\nST: Punter Britton Colquitt is the only veteran here, but that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s not room for talent. Greg Joseph looks to be a solid kicker, and has some competition in camp from rookie Austin Seibert. The Browns lost a great returner in Jabrill Peppers, but players like Landry and Beckham can easily step up. Grade: B-\n\nSchedule Predictions:\n\n2018 Record: 7-8-1\n\n2019 Projection: 11-5 (4-2)\n\nI believe the Browns will turn this year into a division win and a playoff appearance. They likely would\u2019ve been a wild card last year if not for Hue Jackson, and their team has drastically improved sense then. Here are my predictions per game:\n\nWeek 1: Titans at Browns \n\nThe Titans have plenty of question marks and aren\u2019t the better team. Browns get a hand from the home crowd to start 1-0. Score Prediction: 24-13\n\nWeek 2: Browns at Jets\n\nThe Jets are a bottom team in the league, and the Browns easily take the win to continue to 2-0. Score Prediction: 21-10\n\nWeek 3: Rams at Browns \n\nThe Rams just made the Super Bowl and even with some losses are still the better team. It\u2019s a close and hard fought game but they\u2019re too much. This could easily be a mini version of the Rams vs Chiefs game of last season. Browns get their first loss to go 2-1. Score Prediction: 41- 34\n\nWeek 4: Browns at Ravens\n\nBoth teams are solid, but the home crowd helps a hand to the Ravens. These divisional games are all gonna be tough games, as the teams are close and know each other well. Browns go 2-2. Score Prediction: 14-13\n\nWeek 5: Browns at 49ers\n\nWhile the 49ers look good on paper, we haven\u2019t seen it on the field with Jimmy G coming back. Browns get the win here to go 3-2. Score Prediction: 20-14\n\nWeek 6: Seahawks at Browns \n\nAnother tough and close game, Seahawks get a win based on their past success as a team. Browns go 3-3. Score Prediction: 20-17 OT\n\nWeek 7: BYE\n\nWeek 8: Browns at Patriots\n\nIn what is sure to be a fun and competitive match, Brady and Belichick prove too much for the younger Browns. If the Browns do pull off the upset, don't be surprised to hear \"passing of the torch\" comments. Browns fall to 3-4. Score Prediction: 31-30\n\nWeek 9: Browns at Broncos \n\nThere\u2019s too many questions about Flacco or Lock as QB. While the defense is good, the Browns beat it. Browns move to 4-4. Score Prediction: 21-14\n\nWeek 10: Bills at Browns \n\nIn what is my personal favorite matchup of the season, the Lake Erie Bros duke it out in a great matchup. Browns get the win here to go to 5-4. Score Prediction: 38-31 \n\nWeek 11: Steelers at Browns\n\nA nice divisional game is the backdrop to the Browns heading to 6-4, as the Steelers's losses are too much to have a sweep this season. Score Prediction 24-17\n\nWeek 12: Dolphins at Browns \n\nEven Fitzmagic isn\u2019t enough to take the tanking Dolphins past the Browns. Browns go up 7-4. Score Prediction: 17-3 \n\nWeek 13: Browns at Steelers\n\nThe Steelers get their win back in the ever rough to play away in Heinz Field to send the Browns to 7-5. Score Prediction: 17-14 OT\n\nWeek 14: Bengals at Browns\n\nBrowns take down their fellow Ohio team to head to 8-5 and officially better than last year. Score Prediction: 21-0\n\nWeek 15: Browns at Cardinals\n\nAlthough Murray and Kingsbury could turn the Cards around, I\u2019m betting on the safer team for this. Browns move to 9-5 Score Prediction: 28-24\n\nWeek 16: Ravens at Browns\n\nBrowns avenge the earlier loss against their toughest divisional challenger in a game that could very well be the decider for the title. Browns go 10-5. Score Prediction: 29-27\n\nWeek 17: Browns at Bengals \n\nBrowns sweep the Bengals to head to an 11-5 record and a nice playoff spot. This likely won\u2019t be a first round bye record, although it is possible. Score Prediction: 35-17\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe Browns have been a talented team for the last few years, but have suffered from poor coaching and front office decisions. They have corrected that and improved the team to be a contender. While this likely isn\u2019t a year for a Super Bowl trip, they can prove a lot of people wrong that this isn\u2019t just hype. Look for the Browns to be one of a few younger and new faces of the AFC going forward. \n\n[Link to Hub](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/c5o0cx/offseason_review_series_call_for_writers/)",

        "This is the tale of how My friend, my friend's friend (Let's call him Dude), and I rode around Lake Erie on tiny motorcycles, and Why I took 31:22 to finish a ride others did in ~17 hours.\n\nWe start late because my friend overslept and couldn't get his ass in-gear, We start a good half hour after everyone going around the lake has left.\n\nDude isn't a great rider, and he keeps doing dumb things like riding off with his side stand down, Signalling for a turn and not cancelling his signal after the turn, Hanging his helmet on a mirror or putting it ontop of his gas tank only to have it fall off the bike and strike the ground.\n\nWe are making OK time until we get to the Ambassador bridge, While waiting in line dude drops his helmet bad enough to break something, I forget if it was the visor or part of the chin-bar but he's focused on his helmet and didn't pay attention to the instructions of 'Meet us at the Tim Hortons'.\n\nMy friend and I meet up at the Tim Hortons and wait like an HOUR before dude shows up, he's pissed because he was waiting for us on the other side of customs and wasn't paying attention to his phone so he didn't see our texts.\n\nWe re-group, Try and fix his helmet with some tape... \n\nDude want's to take some back roads through Canada, It's going to delay us but hey we are in a different country and it's novel so why not.\n\nWell, we stop in Caledonia for fuel, and Dude takes off his damn backpack and forgets it on top of the fuel pump.\n\nHe realized it was gone like 100 miles later, At the time the only item in the bag he could think of that was important was our spare bluetooth comms, We decide oh-well that sucks we can't go back now and continue on our way.\n\nI'm riding at the rear of our little group, Suddenly the OIL light on my borrowed Kymco comes on, Oh shit! I pull the clutch and coast over to the side of the road.\n\nThe bike doesn't have a dip-stick, only a sight glass, It's dark and raining and I can't tell how much oil I have in the bike, I text my friends and hope they notice I'm missing soon. Eventually they do and come back for me, By then the bike has cooled down and the oil has trickled back into the sight glass and it turns out that was just Kymco's friendly 'Change the Oil' reminder.... We get back on the road.\n\nHours later we cross the border into the US, Dude gets lost when he doesn't pay attention to the freeway signs on the US side of the border and ends up miles away from us, It takes forever but we eventually map out a way to him and re-group.\n\nWhen we make a food stop Dude gets all upset because he remembers his tablet is in the bag and it's got all his personal data on it and no password (WTF!).\n\nSo we spent like an hour doing the google 'I lost my shit' dance trying to lock everything down and make the device brick itself next it gets on WIFI.\n\nWe keep on riding, It gets dark, Dude is riding like crap, We finally pull over to have a riders meeting and he drops the bombshell that the keys to his rental car are in the bag.\n\nThe keys to our Hotel room were in the Rental Car along with our personal belongings and other shit too.\n\nI called the gas station in Canada and they wouldn't answer their phone, So I look up the address on google maps, find the place across the street from it and call them. Being Canadian the people who answered are happy to walk to the gas station and ask them to hold the bag for us until he got there.\n\nIt's been raining for hours, We are exhausted and starting to ride unsafe so  I find a hotel in some shithole to get a couple hours sleep.\n\nIn the morning we send Dude to the nearest car rental place to rent a new car to go get the damn bag.\n\nMy friend and I then continue our way around the lake without him, Get to the camp ground as the last few people are packing up and getting ready to head home. \n\nI fall asleep on a picnic table, My friend ends up taking his truck to go pick Dude up from the rental car place because we were worried about him riding solo from it to the campground. My friend arrives at the rental care place before Dude gets back with his second rental and the bag with all the stuff, Dude left his bike in the parking lot of the rental place with the keys in the ignition....\n\nMy friend and Dude meet back up with me, We load all three bikes + the spare we brought back into the truck and go back to our hotel.",

        "Late to the party, and too late for your document, but I have a bit to add for the peanut gallery:\n\nFirst, it isn't necessary to have all the answers to Christian questions if you're not a Christian.  Religion invents its own questions and then invents its own answers to them. \n\n \n\nQuestion in list form as requested\n\n&gt;*Origin* Where do we come from? Where does all the evidence lead? Is life A happy accident (bob ross says yes)\n\nThe people who ask about origins don't seem interested in the evidence.  But I see that plenty has been provided in the responses regarding evolution &amp; abiogenesis.  The origin of the universe is unknowable, but there is a lot of information about the history of our universe.  (Unanswerable:  is it the only one in existence?  Have there been others in the past?)\n\n&gt;*Identify* Who are we? What does it mean to be human, as opposed to an animal?\n\nHumans *are* animals.  Proof of that:  animal testing in medicine is applicable to humans.  Observations of other intelligent animals have shown that many of the features we used to think were unique to us are not unique to us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;*Meaning* Why are we here? What is the purpose of our live?\n\nThe inherent assumption in this question is that life would be meaningless without an afterlife to look forward to.  For many of us, having only our limited time on the planet gives us *more* meaning, not less.  Once I was on a plane that had an engine go out over Lake Erie, and we had to divert to Cleveland, 30 minutes away, flying in large circles.  I realized I might have only 30 minutes left to live, and I had to decide what to do with it?  Pray?  Nothing to pray for.  But there was a high school kid traveling with his ice hockey team that was spread out around the plane because they had standby tickets because they had just advanced in a big competition.  Nobody could get up out of their seats, so I decided I'd spend my last 30 minutes talking to this kid about his hockey team to make sure he didn't get anxious.   In a sense, every day is our last 30 minutes because nobody is guaranteed anything.  Some atheists phrase their life's ambition as \"to leave the planet in better shape than I found it.\"  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Morality* How should we live? What is right and wrong? - and who says so? Culture? Social Norms?\n\n&gt;If belonging to a religion could settle what is right or wrong there would be no religious wars.  There would have been no protestants setting fire to Catholic churches or Sunni muslims bombing Shia mosques.  There would also be no child sex abuse by religious leaders (It's not just the Catholics!)  Morality is one of those concepts invented by religion in order to make religion seem essential.  Take away religion, and you have questions of how people can get along with each other for their own and society's (and the planet's) betterment and peace.  The so-called \"morality\" of religious extremists fails on many levels.  Does consensual gay sex between two adults harm anyone?  No.  It's not wrong.  If a man rapes a woman, does that harm anyone?  Yes, possibly more than one.  Does forcing the woman to marry her rapist set it right?  No, it makes things worse, and yet the Bible says that's what has to happen.  Is forcing someone to work for you without paying them (slavery) wrong?  Yes.  It hurts them.  And yet the Bible allowed and condoned slavery.  Is cutting off a girl's clitoris hurtful to her?  Yes.  And yet, in some religions this is not only allowed.  It is required.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The reason for \"objective\" morality is that some people are sociopaths.  Basing a society solely on empathy would fail because not everyone is capable of empathy.   All societies punish murder, theft,  dishonesty, etc.  You don't need the Bible to tell you those things are wrong.  (Check out Frans Van der Waal's [video about capuchin monkey morality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meiU6TxysCg)!)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;But... consider Christian \"morality.\"  Christ died for our sins?  Then what incentive is there for anyone to do the \"right\" thing?     Well, there's hell if you're *really* bad...  but mainly if you don't believe in Jesus....   so.... you can do (almost) whatever you want as long as you sincerely believe that Jesus died for you?  How moral is that?  It's scapegoating (a.k.a.[penal substitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penal_substitution))\n\n*Destiny* Where are we going after death? How can we be sure?\n\nThere is no \"we\" after death.  This is one of those questions that religion invented in order to make people think they needed religion.  If you don't believe in an immortal soul, you don't have to worry about where it goes.   And anyway, the Christian heaven sounds really boring, almost like being on heroin for eternity, and how can you feel the flames of Hell after all your nerve endings are gone?  As Jim Jeffries said, \"[It's eternal.  You'll get used to it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf4L31TBr7w).\"\n\n(Lists a Christian source)\n\n&gt;Prove God Wrong. Give evidence as to Jesus not being resurrected from the grave. However, have integrity in your approach and spend some time listening to both sides of the debate.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;There are no two sides.  There is \"evidence\" in the Bible - four different stories.  How can the Bible be true and accurate and have four different versions?  It even has two versions of the creation story!    And then there is a total lack of evidence elsewhere.  One supposed reference a few centuries later, after Christianity had been writing and rewriting its stories and just making things up in a few different denominations.  The Romans kept excellent records.  No records of Christ.  Egyptians kept records.  No records of a star in the east, Jews who were enslaved, and no record of the world going dark on that third day.  The Chinese also kept astronomical records - no record of those things, either.\n\nI used to write a blog, and[I have a list of questions for Christians](https://ladyatheist.blogspot.com/2011/05/questions-for-christians.html) that you are free to steal (they're not new anyway) if you'd like to turn the tables on this person.",

        "Cleveland based sailor here!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are plenty of docks in the area where you can keep your boat.  If you go the yacht club route, many of them offer winter storage for a nominal extra fee.  For the rest of this season, once you get the boat here, I recommend pulling it right away as most boats have to be out of the water by the end of October or much earlier.  It gets cold fast around here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI read in the comments you'll be working in the Twinsburg area- the closest YC according to Google Maps is Point Yacht Club, right by Cedar Point.  Couldn't find a price though.  Also seems to be mostly powerboats.  If you are looking to dock with primarily other sailboats, Edgewater YC is your best bet.  Also good place to be if you plan to race your boat.  There are also great facilities there- nice showers, bathrooms, electric and water provided on the dock, free wifi, a pool that's free for members, and they make a mean veggie burger.  Additionally, whatever you spend on meals and other things at the club throughout the month is deducted from your monthly fee.  For example (I'm still a kid, so don't take my word on the numbers) the membership fee as I recall is $40 a month, but if you buy $28 dollars of food, you only have to pay $12 at the end of the month.  Also free popcorn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you want to go the cheaper, public route, Edgewater Marina is right across the channel from the YC (like, maybe a 30 sec swim from one dock to the other).  It is overwhelmingly sailboats, but geographically both the club and the marina are great places to be- from the dock to the lake entrance under motor is like, a minute or two max depending on traffic.  Edgewater YC also has a great gas dock- I don't know if it's open to the Marina as well, but I don't believe they have their own so it might.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome other, maybe cheaper suggestions if you want to look into those are the E 55th street marina (run by the metroparks), Cleveland Yachting Club (in Rocky River, really nice but also a little more pricey), Mentor Harbor, and Forest City.  Forest City doesn't have a restaurant kitchen, though they do make food for special events (races, etc.) and the kitchen is free for members to use, so if you need to throw something in the fridge or you've made dinner for your family or friends and want to throw it in the oven when you're there as opposed to having it sit all day, you can do that.  You just have to replace what you use if there's anything in the kitchen.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll the clubs in the area are great places for family fun.  If you eventually start a family, this child will literally have access to resources and connections in every possible field of employment.  For example, in my dad's old racing crew, there's everyone from a cruise ship engineer to a PR manager in Senator Portman's office.  On our current crew, it's mostly engineers, but there's occasionally a music teacher up from Texas and a guy from Germany who apparently gets taller for a living.  While my dad only has one brother and my mom no siblings at all, I was born into a family with literally more than 20 aunts and uncles who love me.  If you don't mind a little bit of smoking and drinking, there's literally no place else you'd want to be.  While a marina has a community of boaters, if you're looking for more of a huge extended family, a yacht club is the place to be.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, Lake Erie is one of the most challenging lakes in the world to sail on.  The shallowness of the lake combined with the constant changing of Cleveland weather makes the lake extremely unfriendly.  Sailing on another lake will feel like a walk in the park after this.  When I was 13, I did a trip from Milwaukee to Cleveland on a tallship, and we could feel when we hit Lake Erie.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for rambling on.  Hope this helps.",

It\u2019s shiny and new and less run down, but it lacks the old buildings, neighborhoods, and cultural institutions that Cincinnati and Cleveland have. Downtown Columbus also feels like a suburb with a few skyscrapers and a lot of parking more than the other two. They do have some great museums and parks as well as an excellent zoo. Short North and the neighborhoods along High Street bear OSU have wonderful restaurants, bars, and shops.\n\nCleveland has been picked on the most of any of the Three Cs, and natives here will tell you they don\u2019t have an accent\u2014but our river hasn\u2019t burned in over 50 years and our people now no longer sound exactly like people on national network TV. Downtown feels like a big city\u2014so long as you overlook a few parking lots west of Public Square\u2014otherwise it stands in for New York and other big cities in lots of movies. You\u2019ll find grand historic architecture from 100+ years ago that has been restored to its former glory thanks to historic preservation efforts. The city is loaded with arts, including a world class art museum funded by endowments that allow free admission, the second largest performing arts center in the nation\u2014Playhouse Square, and one of the finest and most famous orchestras, the Cleveland Orchestra, which plays at Severance Hall. While manufacturing and shipping built Cleveland, what keeps it going today is healthcare, with one of the Top 5 hospitals in the country\u2014The Cleveland Clinic\u2014along with nationally ranked University Hospitals. There are numerous small venues for live music, several arts districts, and a plethora of sports bars that bleed Orange &amp; Brown on Sundays and loyally support their Indians and Cavaliers. The city had been hit hard by economic changes over the past 50 years, but within the last 10 years I\u2019ve seen the city get its pride back.\n\nOhio for the most part has rather friendly and unpretentious people, and the communities are big enough to have plenty to offer but small enough that anyone can make a difference. Beyond the Three Cs there are smaller metros like Akron-Canton, Dayton, Toledo, and Youngstown-Warren, and innumerable quiet and quaint little towns. Don\u2019t miss the sophisticated college town of Oberlin, with probably the most liberal arts college in the nation. Yellow Springs is another interesting college town with some fantastic parks nearby. Wooster, Mount Vernon, Medina, and Delaware are a few other smaller cities I definitely recommend checking out.\n\nSeveral parks are essential to the Ohio experience as well\u2014as Ohio isn\u2019t all just farms or cities. Hocking Hills State Park offers the best hiking in the state. Cuyahoga Valley National Park has most of the Ohio &amp; Erie Towpath Bike Trail and the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad. You don\u2019t want to miss the Lake Erie Islands or Cedar Point Amusement Park.\n\nOhio isn\u2019t really dominated by any one thing or place everyone thinks of\u2014there\u2019s really something for everyone. It makes it hard to plug just one thing. The culture of the state is also rather diverse\u2014it\u2019s not like any of our cities really feel like the others. There\u2019s a pretty remarkable difference between even near neighbors like Cleveland and Akron. You\u2019d never expect Northwest Ohio to be so flat if all you ever saw was Southeast Ohio, and vice versa. Small towns only take 30 minutes or so to reach from most of our major city centers\u2014and they don\u2019t feel like suburbs, they feel like small communities.\n\nIt\u2019s sort of hard to explain, but Ohio has a lot to like and a lot to see and understand. Pretty much everywhere you go has a story, and a lot of these stories made an impact on American history and on the modern world we take for granted. The Wright Brothers came from Dayton. The first electric traffic signal was invented and used in Cleveland. The first ship-to-to shore communication happened in Put-in-Bay on Lake Erie. The prototype for the Brooklyn Bridge still stands over the Ohio River in Cincinnati. There was nearly a war with Michigan over Toledo.\n\nJust make sure you get a good warm winter coat and you have all-season tires on your car for when the snow flies. And hopefully you get to enjoy a good fall bonfire with good friends and the great craft beer made all over the state. Go pick apples in an orchard this fall and enjoy some pumpkin pie while exploring the gorgeous fall color. Find a hill and go sledding after a good snow this winter. Get out and see the flowers and the trees in spring. Go camping, hiking, or boating in summer, and get to Cedar Point, Kings Island, and the county fair (especially the Lorain County and Canfield Fairs).",

        "Do you like spending time in the great outdoors and doing shit out in nature? What about concerts or a having a good music scene? Those two areas Buffalo has covered pretty good. I would say that they are two of the most endearing things about Buffalo (to me at least). Food, restaurants, available grocery stores and shit like that is also totally slamming in Buffalo (but that would be a whole other post about the quality of places to eat, Wegmans and the breweries).\n\nBuffalo sits on the edge of Lake Erie and the Niagara River. Niagara Falls is 20 minutes away, the waterfalls are cool to visit but the place you really need to check out is the Niagara Gorge (the big canyon like thing that the falls carved out). It is full of deep ravines, steep cliff walls, some of the fastest rapids in North America, old growth forests and a ton of history. There is actually 10 state parks going from Buffalo's harbor on Lake Erie, down the Niagara River and to where the river meets Lake Ontario (but Niagara Falls State Park gets all the attention from outsiders). It's about an hour drive from end to end and you will be able to encounter; two of the Great Lakes, three massive waterfalls, one of the fastest rivers in the world, swamps, old growth forests, beaches, high  rocky cliffs, deep ravines, caves and an abundance of wildlife.\n\nAlso nearby is Letchworth State Park (ranked one of the best state parks in the country) which has it's own deep gorge and three giant waterfalls, Allegany State Park (the very edge of the Appalachian Mountains and NY's largest state park, borders Allegheny National Forest in Pennsylvania, so it's really just one big wilderness area), Zoar Valley Multiple Use Area (another deep ass gorge with waterfalls, the most wild and dangerous of the \"big three\" here) . We probably have more waterfalls in this area than anywhere else in the United States. There is a bunch of other state forests,  national wild life refuges, ski resorts, county and city parks (such as the Olmsted Parks, Delaware Park is Buffalo's Central Park; designed by the same dude around the same time). The Adirondack Park is about 6 hours away , it is the largest tract of land set aside for wilderness conservation/preservation. The park is larger in size than Yellowstone, the Everglades, Glacial and the Grand Canyon National Parks combined! Niagara Falls, Letchworth, Allegany/Allegheny and the Adirondacks all should/could be National Parks, but NY has a long history of conservation (the Falls were the first state park in the US) and some of them were actually the models the National Park Service was based off of (especially the Adirondack Park),so New York will never give up control of them (they also make a whole lot of money for the state) but they are on another level compared to other state parks on the East Coast/Great Lakes.\n\nEven the stuff Buffalo is nationally known for has to do with the outdoors. The Buffalo Bills stadium is the third oldest in the NFL and has no roof or dome, so games are open to the elements. The stadium is located a short distance from the city in one of the suburbs that has a low population density, so there is plenty of room for people to tailgate before the game and get really wild. It is also very very close to Lake Erie and gets hit with the huge gusts of wind that come off of it . When one of the big lake effect blizzards hits Buffalo, people often actually get excited for it, since work/school gets cancelled, a massive amount of snow comes down at once and going out in it seems like an adventure (it only really sucks when you are caught driving in it or stuck at work/someplace you don't want to be). People here embrace what the rest of the country calls bad weather, so if you move here, you gotta like winter and be ready to deal with it. Hockey is extremely popular here if you are into the sport, there is the Buffalo Sabres NHL team, but also the largest pond hockey tournament, the NHL combine, an abundance playing/skating ice rinks and big time hockey events that have been held here in the past like the first ever Winter Classic and the World Junior Championship.\n\nThe music scene in Buffalo, goes hand in hand with the city's bar culture. Last call is at 4 am (one of the latest in the nation) and the city has one of the highest bars per capita ratios. So there is tons of places for live music and bands to play. The city has quite a few small indie labels, a few good record stores, really good DIY ethic ( like art/venue spaces, house shows/parties and festivals like Infringement or Music is Art. There is a pretty good variety of bands and music acts, almost everything is covered, but hardcore/punk/metal/alternative are probably the most popular genres. Cannibal Corpse and Everytime I Die are both from Buffalo, but jam band acts like Moe. and Aquarius also are, along with indie groups like Lemuria, rap acts like Westside Gunn, even Polka like Those Idiots or the biggest band to ever come out of Buffalo, the Goo Goo Dolls (they were once cool!). The amusement park, Six Flags Darien Lake has the largest concert amphitheater, there is also the smaller Artpark amphitheaters (there is 2) , New Era Field (Bills stadium), Keybank Center (Sabres arena), Canalside Rock the Harbor series, Town Ballroom (holds about 500) and the Rapids Theater (holds about 1,200) in the Falls for touring national acts. Buffalo also has it's own philharmonic orchestra that plays a bunch of different concerts through out the year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA lot of people will try to compare Buffalo to the popular hipster cities (like Brooklyn, Portland or Austin) but I honestly think it is closer in spirit and culture to New Orleans. It's a kind of poor city, that was once an  important and crucial shipping port, that's whole culture is based off of going out and partying. Both were originally founded by the French, both have a strong presence of the Catholic church, both are really big on hot sauce, both have been beaten down by the loss of the industrial sector. There is a ton of Victorian homes, old ass cemeteries, big ass churches and houses with balconies. Buffalo is like the bizarro world New Orleans. Instead of having the Gulf of Mexico and the Mississippi right there, we have the Great Lakes and the Niagara river. They get hurricanes that make the national news, we get blizzards whenever we hit the mainstream media. Dyngus Day is the Buffalo take on crazy, let's get totally torn up kind of party holiday like Mardis Gras. Allentown is Buffalo's French Quarter and Bourbon Street.  Hardcore, punk and metal are also both really really popular in both cities. Buffalo and New Orleans also both have a ridiculous amount of parades that happen.  Going out to a small concert at a bar or a house party is how you are most likely to make a lot of friends (there is a lot happening on the weekends,I think people from Buffalo actually take this for granted).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you ever feel like visiting a big global mega city, Toronto is about a 1-2 hour drive from Buffalo or anywhere in the surrounding area. the city is literally on the international border, so almost everything in Southern Ontario is open to you (as long as you don't have a DUI or some kind of felony conviction). Toronto, St. Catharines, Fort Erie, Hamilton, the Algonquin Park and Niagara Falls are all super close to Buffalo. Montreal is about 6 hours away, just past the Adirondacks. Niagara Falls, Ontario is Canada's take on a place like Las Vegas or Orlando. Weed is legal on the national level there, gambling is also legalized and a huge industry, the drinking age is 19 and prostitution is decriminalized. It's that kind of place, people fly in from like Saudi Arabia or Brazil and flaunt a serious amount of money. There is a ton of cross over between the two regions, so you are just as likely to see Ontario plates as you are seeing cars with NY plates everywhere you go.",

FYI, the world's \u201cfirst climate change refugee\u201d Ioane Teitiota from Kiribati's claim was dismissed by a court in New Zealand in 2014.\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/environment/2005/oct/12/naturaldisasters.climatechange1\nhttps://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/world-s-first-climate-change-refugee-has-appeal-rejected-as-new-zealand-rules-ioane-teitiota-must-9358547.html\n\nJun 24, 2008, Dr. James Hansen (again) says, echoing other scientists, that in 5 to 10 years the arctic will be free of sea ice in the summer.\n\nhttps://cei.org/sites/default/files/30.gif\nhttps://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1988&amp;dat=20080624&amp;id=7mgiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7qkFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5563,4123490\n\nDec 14, 2008, Climate messiah AlGore warns that the north polar ice cap will be complete ice free in 5 years (2013).\n\nhttps://cei.org/sites/default/files/31.png\nhttps://wattsupwiththat.com/2018/12/16/ten-years-ago-algore-predicted-the-north-polar-ice-cap-would-be-gone-inconveniently-its-still-there/\n\nA year later, Dec 14, 2009, AlGore again makes the same 5 year prediction, this time saying the arctic ocean will be ice free by 2014.\n\nhttps://cei.org/sites/default/files/35.png\nhttp://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2009/12/gore-new-study-sees-nearly-ice-free-arctic-summer-ice-cap-as-early-as-2014/1#.XVm6Py2ZNu3\n\nDec 9, 2013, an ongoing USDOE backed research project led by US Navy scientist predicts the arctic could lose its summer ice cover as early as 2016.\n\nhttps://cei.org/sites/default/files/37.png\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/environment/earth-insight/2013/jul/24/arctic-ice-free-methane-economy-catastrophe",

        "Una nueva semana de contemplar de que s\u00ed se puede, de que lo peor ya pas\u00f3, de que el camino es por ac\u00e1, de que esto es realidad, de que no iba a ser f\u00e1cil, de que (ingrese AQU\u00cd su slogan favorito).\n\nNo se los cont\u00e9 porque no ando tan rediturro \u00faltimamente pero el s\u00e1bado sal\u00ed con mi compadre, mi ahijado y mi novia a la zona de juegos del COTO. A la vuelta nos volvimos en bondi, con la idea de bajar del colectivo justo en frente del D\u00eda% para comprar unas Santas Wendelinas. Cuesti\u00f3n que al bajar del bondi, justo en la puerta del D\u00eda% meto la mano en el bolsillo donde siempre est\u00e1 la billetera, pero la billetera no est\u00e1. No. Meto la mano en el bolsillo donde suele estar la billetera, pero la billetera no est\u00e1. Puede. Meto la mano en los bolsillos donde nunca est\u00e1 la billetera, pero la billetera no est\u00e1. Ser.\n\nLRCCDLLPQPDMQSLNMRMTDMPRSTMDLPMRSRMNDLPFPRSMMLPTQP.\n\n\nListo. Llamo a las tarjetas para darlas de baja, sigo con los protocolos en donde es m\u00e1s facil mandar todo a la mierda pero bueno, soluciones siempre hay. Nunca sent\u00ed tan pero tan \u00fatil a la app de Ual\u00e1, el homebanking y la mar en coche. hago transferencia de dinero, compro por internet, todo para que quien haya encontrado la billetera (adem\u00e1s de hacerse del efectivo) no me reventara las tarjetas aprovechando el parecido f\u00edsico que supuse tendr\u00eda con mi foto del DNI para hacer compras en locales donde si te piden la firma es mucho.\n\nYa con todo eso resuelto eran pasadas las 23hs cuando suena el tel\u00e9fono de casa. Una voz desconocida al otro lado del tubo pregunta por m\u00ed, intenta corroborar mi identidad, que efectivamente soy yo, que no soy esa persona parecida a m\u00ed que me iba a reventar la tarjeta. Pero...qui\u00e9n me llama a altas horas de la noche un s\u00e1bado?? ERA EL CHOFER DEL COLECTIVO!!\n\nMe cont\u00f3 que reci\u00e9n termin\u00f3 su recorrido. Que encontr\u00f3 la billetera e hizo todo lo posible para ubicarme y devolverla. Que con la ayuda de su esposa e hijos pudo encontrarme en Facebook. Qu\u00e9 suerte! Porque ten\u00eda la intenci\u00f3n de ir hasta la direcci\u00f3n del DNI para devolv\u00e9rmela pero eso hubiera sido in\u00fatil ya que al cambiar la numeraci\u00f3n de casa (y al no hacer yo la renovaci\u00f3n del DNI que h\u00e1ganme acordar tengo que hacer) hubiera dejado la billetera en cualquier lugar. Menos mal que estaba mi carnet de Racing, y toda otra parafernalia acad\u00e9mica, en la billetera! De ese modo me pudo ubicar pero, y c\u00f3mo se hiso de mi n\u00famero de tel\u00e9fono? Si yo no dejo dato alguno de mi huella de carbono en la internet! Bueno, ning\u00fan sistema es perfecto ni infalible. Resulta que una vez, un amigo, en una foto super random, me pidi\u00f3 el N\u00b0 de tel, y se lo escrib\u00ed pero onda *once quince tres cinco cero* as\u00ed. Me sent\u00ed super stalkeado por un colectivero y su familia!!\n\nPero una masa el chofer. Quedamos en encontrarnos el domingo a la ma\u00f1ana para la devoluci\u00f3n. Me tuve que levantar temprano, sin resaca, tomarme un tren, un colectivo, explorar otras conurbanidades. Pero vali\u00f3 la pena. El chofer, llam\u00e9mosle ANGEL, fue acompa\u00f1ado de su mujer. No me sac\u00f3 ni un centavo, estaba todo intacto. No me acept\u00f3 ni un peso, quedamos en un d\u00eda comer un asado.\n\nY en 15 d\u00edas tengo listas las tarjetas nuevas luego de haberlas cancelado.\n\n\nFIN.",

I almost never catch good threads when they start.  :'(\n\nWhile \"New York City\" is officially only one county, a good rule of thumb is that all the counties south of and including Orange and Putnam Counties would be \"Downstate\", and everything north of them would be considered \"Upstate.\"\n\nDownstate is your New York City you're used to.  Extremely large amount of people in a small area, ludicrously expensive, not a whole lot of greenery, but the farther away from NYC proper you get within downstate, the less so it becomes.\n\nPolitically, Downstate is insanely democratic, while upstate is fairly Republican (if it weren't for the four main cities Upstate, it'd probably be one of the most heavily Republican areas in the country.)  Downstate has twice the population of all of upstate.  Additionally, Upstate had historically been a thriving region for manufacturing in the 19th and 20th centuries, but has seen significant decline starting in the 1960's as manufacturing jobs left the country as a whole, as we didn't diversify enough in time.  Since the country came about when only \"First Past the Post\" voting existed, (about 80-ish years before Ranked Choice, which I believe our founding fathers would have preferred had they thought of it) that means that Downstate basically runs all of the politics; Since we haven't seen much development, large swathes of Upstate feels like is has effectively no say in statewide politics, and that NYC takes a disproportionate share of the state funding and attention.  This animosity is so great that upstate politicians bring the up the idea of splitting New York into multiple different states on a relatively frequent basis.  \n\n\nAs for major geographical features, New York State has a lot more than what most foreigners expect.  Between Downstate and Albany you have the [Catskill mountains.](https://cdn-image.travelandleisure.com/sites/default/files/styles/1600x1000/public/catskills-catskills0416.jpg?itok=LKbX7kgk)  In the northeastern portion you have the Adirondack mountains, the tallest of which is [Mount Marcy](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Adirondacks_Mount_Marcy_From_Mount_Haystack.JPG/1024px-Adirondacks_Mount_Marcy_From_Mount_Haystack.JPG) at 5344 ft (1629 m.)  The town of Lake Placid (abbreviated as \"L Placid\" on the map, in northwestern Essex county) is where the Winter Olympics were hosted in 1932 and 1980, and is only one of nine cities to host the Winter/Summer Olympics more than once so far.  Within the St. Lawrence River to the north, you have the [Thousand Islands](https://visit1000islands.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/CF006549_downsized-1500x710.jpg), which is a chain of more than 1,800 small islands.  The landmark within this region is [Boldt Castle,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boldt_Castle#/media/File:Ch%C3%A2teau_de_Boldt.jpg) which was owned by George Boldt, owner of the famous [Waldorf Astoria Hotel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldorf_Astoria_New_York#/media/File:St_Bartholomews_and_The_Waldorf_Astoria_Hotel.jpg) in New York City.  This mansion was built as a present to his wife Louise Kehrer Boldt, but construction was halted in 1904 upon his wife's death.  To the north and west, of the state, we have two of the five great lakes:  Lake Ontario and Lake Erie, respectively.

Because of the Great Lakes, the weather can be very erratic; the Summers in general are quite sunny, fairly hot and humid, but the Spring and Fall are very quick and the temperature and weather patterns change drastically.  It can be 70 F (21 C) and sunny one day, or 30 F (-1 C) and snowing the next.  Sometimes this can even happen in a span of a couple of hours.  Also, the winters are SNOWY and CLOUDY.  Syracuse (my home city) is the snowiest city in the United States with a population of over 100 thousand and ties for fifth place for snowiest city worldwide, averaging 124 in (314 cm) per year; the record was 193 in (409 cm.)  The eastern shore of Onondaga Lake, however, (the \"Tug Hill Plateau\") usually gets more than twice that, but there are only small towns there.  The snow in and of itself is [quite pretty.](https://www.tripsavvy.com/thmb/7c2Z_qtXLzjulCIzd3U1T3PpMSk=/2120x1414/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/GettyImages-546745202-5887886c5f9b58bdb32748a9.jpg) But as I mentioned, Syracuse is one of the cloudiest cities in the country; more than half of the year is completely overcast, and we see virtually zero direct sunlight from the second half of October to the second half of January.  As much as I love the city, the clouds really get to me.  My joke is that in Syracuse, Spring is May, Summer is June to September, Fall is October, and Winter is November to April.  But the thing is is that it's actually true from a climate standpoint.  (Something I just learned right now is that Japan of all places actually has the top three snowiest cities:  Aomori at #1 gets **314 in/798 cm per year, HOLY SHIT.)**",

        "The oyster bar reeked of rum and horseradish. It started with a slight burning of the nose, blooming into a deeper and more refined aroma, searing the throat, mixing with the humid salt-spray of the bay, and ending with a mint julep on the rocks. \n\nWater ran down the edges of our glasses\u2014mine barely sipped\u2014hers empty and sitting alongside it\u2019s drained counterpart. Warm light hit and reflected off the edges of the glass in a kaleidoscope across the bamboo placemats. It was beautiful. I couldn\u2019t help but notice how the light kept me from making the eye contact we both so desperately wanted but were unwilling to maintain. \n\nThe server dropped by with a fresh plate of oysters on the raw and two more mint juleps. It was a welcome break from the silence. I took a long sip, then grabbed a rough half-shell and started slurping. She twirled her fingers around the rim of her glass. Her gold-rimmed glasses dropped lower, and a small smile curled around the dimples of her overly-sunburnt face. \n\n\u201cYou ever dropped a bucket of oysters in a pond?\u201d she asked, licking the sugar from her fingers. \u201cA real dirty pond, with gator\u2019s and muck and dirt and duckweed. Just dropped them right in. You know what happens?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re out a few hundred bucks?\u201d\n\nShe laughed. \u201cSure. But the oysters are filter feeders. They\u2019ll clear out the pond in a few days. They\u2019ll suck away the dirt and chemicals and grime and give you crystal clear water. It\u2019s what happened to lake Erie a few years back with the zebra mussels. It\u2019s happening now up north; oyster farms in the bay are cleaning up the toxins.\u201d\n\nI scooped another divot of horseradish onto the next oyster. \u201cYou should see what they use tilapia for.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d I said, \u201cNevermind. What about they oysters? They taste good, and they\u2019re perfectly safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t really taste good, do they? Otherwise you wouldn\u2019t have the cocktail sauce, or the horseradish, or the mint juleps. And if they taste so good, why slurp them down? You can\u2019t enjoy them like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the point.\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly!\u201d she clapped her hands together. When she crossed her arms and leaned in towards me I could almost taste the liquor on her breath. \n\nBy god, what was still I doing here? \n\nI should have left an hour ago, when the rest of my coworkers called it a night. But there was something oddly captivating about the subtle look she gave me earlier, as if I had every right to leave but would be in for something unforgettable if I chose to stay. \n\nShe drained the bottom of her fourth julep and let the glass slip from her hands, clatter on the table and roll to rest with the others. \u201cIt\u2019s all metaphorical. We slurp down oysters without a second thought of where they\u2019ve been or how hard they work. They sit and suck our poison all day and we slurp them down with greedy eyes, always wanting more and more until we\u2019ve taken every last pearl.\u201d\n\nShe tilted her wrists, flashing the pearl bracelet and the empty ring finger. \u201cMy husband got me this when I first started at NASA. You know how much it cost him?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot enough?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot enough,\u201d she whispered. The thought seemed to swirl around her mind like the julep swirled in another rocks glass, catching a spark of light, and the idea was just grandiose enough to pour over. \u201cYou know why we want to leave this planet so badly?\u201d\n\n\u201cCrocs are coming back in style,\u201d I said, more confident with two mint juleps down the hatch.\n\n\u201cWe found a garbage patch.\u201d \n\nShe didn\u2019t smile. She didn\u2019t laugh or brush her hair back, and she didn\u2019t look off to the side or flush with embarrassment. She looked straight into my eyes, and I watched the color drain from her face as she spoke with complete seriousness.\n\n\u201cThe great pacific one?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Mariana trench one. The one no one knows about, because they really not ought to know about the one thing that could end the world.\u201d\n\nThe temperature seemed to drop ten degrees. A chill ran down my spine. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen we dumped millions of gallons of oil in the Deepwater Horizon spill, bacteria evolved to destroy it. We have things that eat plastic for breakfast. We can convert radioactive isotopes into useable fuel. Shit, even trees filter out the air.\u201d \n\nThe waiter came back with a smile and another two mint juleps, but she waved him away with a groan.

        "**Ship Guide #36: CSS Buckeye** (Part 1)\n\nOne of the most interesting, yet obscure, ships of the Second American Civil War was CSS Buckeye, the first carrier built by the nascent Combined Syndicates of America. \n\nThe *Buckeye*\u2019s origins trace back to 1913, when the Canadian government began work on the \u201cfourth\u201d [Welland Canal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welland_Canal), an expansion to the locks which connected Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, allowing ships to travel from the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean via the St. Lawrence river. The new locks (and other related improvements to what would become the St. Lawrence Seaway) would allow the passage of much larger vessels, and some steamship companies in both Canada and the U.S. began contemplating the construction of new ships for the profitable \u201ccanaller\u201d trade. However, with the outbreak of the Weltkrieg and Canada\u2019s entry into that conflict, work on the expanded canal and locks came to a complete halt.  \n\nAfter the end of the Weltkrieg, work on the waterway resumed, and several optimistic shipping companies again considered ordering new ships in anticipation of the canal\u2019s opening. As a result, the ship that would become known as the CSS *Buckeye* was laid down in Cleveland in 1922 as the SS *City of Sandusky*. \n\nThe ship was designed to fit into the new locks with room to spare, while still being large enough to carry a sizable load; she was 502 feet long on the waterline, 63 feet across the beams, and had a 24 foot draft loaded. Her configuration was similar to many other lake bulk freighters, with a superstructure at the bow for the bridge and crew's quarters, and another at the stern over the engine rooms, which was capped by the ship's funnel. In between were a set of spacious covered cargo holds. Power was provided by a pair of steam triple-expansion engines, each driving their own shaft. Precise power output is not known, but the *City of Sandusky* was reported to be capable of 17.5 knots when new. \n\nLaunched in 1924 and ready for service in early 1925, the *City of Sandusky* was renamed before her first sailing to SS *James E. Campbell,* in honor of the recently-deceased former Governor of Ohio. Ready for service before the locks it was designed to fit through, the ship\u2019s operators assigned it to routes around Lake Erie, on what was assumed to be a temporary basis. However, the events of 1925 would ruin the plans of the ship\u2019s owners. The British Revolution and the subsequent liquidation of the British banks caused the loss of much financial support for the construction work on the Welland Canal, and the social problems caused by the influx of royalist refugees occupied the Canadian government's attention for several years afterwards, causing work to be suspended yet again in 1926. \n\nWith the onset of the great depression and the bankruptcy of several shipping companies, the *James E. Campbell* changed hands several times, and at some point in the 1930s was renamed SS *Buckeye State.* Her career during this period was quiet, with sailings being relatively infrequent thanks to the sluggish economy, and for the most part she remained near her birthplace on Lake Erie, carrying whatever cargoes could be found. \n\nHowever, in 1931 the ship\u2019s future appeared to become brighter, as the Canadian government announced the resumption of work on the canal expansion projects, as a well-funded public works project. Thus, the *Buckeye State* continued her usual work until late 1935, when the expanded seaway was nearing completion. At this point, she returned to Cleveland to spend the winter while the lake was iced over, and it was hoped that she could be refitted and inspected during this time, so as to be ready to traverse the St. Lawrence by the time the ice melted. The refit was necessary, as there were concerns that several modifications made during her service had increased the draft enough to make her unable to fit into the new locks. In addition, the *Buckeye State*\u2019s operators envisioned the ship traveling as far north as Newfoundland, and it would be necessary to prepare the ship for operations in the rougher and saltier waters it would encounter there. \n\nUnfortunately for the ship\u2019s owners, this plan would not come to pass. Due to a lack of funds, the extreme labor unrest, and social turmoil in the lead-up to the 1936 presidential election, virtually no work had been done by May 1936, when King Edward VIII officially opened the newly expanded St. Lawrence seaway in a public ceremony. By November of that year, the only work that had been finished on the *Buckeye State* was the addition of a new coat of paint, and it looked as though she would spend another winter idle in Cleveland. \n\nBut there was trouble brewing in the city: When Jack Reed was elected president of the United States in that November, the city\u2019s upper crust became quite worried, for obvious reasons. A clique of rich Clevelanders, led by Industrialist Howard Z. Matheson, concocted a scheme to avoid the oft-threatened expropriation of their wealth by the new government. Mindful of the fact that the idle *Buckeye State* was one of the few large vessels capable of escaping into Lake Ontario, the group pooled funds to quietly purchase the ship, and begin secretly loading it with some of their assets.  \n\nThus, for much of the winter of 1936-1937 the *Buckeye State* sat at the dockside in Cleveland appearing nearly derelict by day, but slowly accumulating a valuable cargo by night. Machine tools and equipment pulled from factories thought to be at imminent risk of nationalization made up the majority of this cargo, but also inside the holds of the *Buckeye State* were several luxury automobiles, trucks, a switching locomotive, and even a trove of carefully-packaged paintings and other art from the private collection of one of the ship\u2019s new owners.\n\nWhile the crew of the *Buckeye State* mostly originated from Ohio and Michigan, and were sympathetic to the Syndicalist cause, the promises of large sums of money by Matheson in exchange for their cooperation kept them in line.\n\nThe ship was thus maintained in a state of readiness through the first month of 1937, though none of her new owners wanted to suggest that they leave just yet, as some held out hope that Reed\u2019s government would be prevented from acting on their syndicalist plans by congress. These hopes were dashed in early March, when General Douglas MacArthur marched on washington intent on ousting President Reed. With civil war appearing imminent, Matheson and his clique finally decided it was time for action. \n\nOn the night of March 4th-5th, 120 wealthy passengers, along with a significant quantity of their last-minute luggage, were brought aboard the *Buckeye State.* Braving the last of the winter ice, and enduring the discomfort of the crowded ship (she was only designed to accommodate a crew of 30 men), the ship arrived in the Canadian city of Port Colborne late the next day, where her passengers requested asylum. After bringing the passengers ashore, the Canadian authorities were at a loss for what to do with the *Buckeye State* due to the confused situation in the U.S., and it was eventually decided to temporarily impound her and her cargo. \n\nWhen the fighting began between the various American factions several weeks later, the Canadian government decided to seize New England and set up a puppet regime. It was decided to \u201crepatriate\u201d the passengers brought aboard the *Buckeye State* in New England, and to offload her cargo there for return to its owners. Thus, the ship was directed to Buffalo, New York, and much of her cargo was discharged there. However, Matheson and his group desired that several items (including a large steel rolling mill) be sent to Boston, the capital of the new regime, and they were too bulky to be offloaded at Buffalo and shipped overland. \n\nSo it came about that for the first and only time in her lifetime, the *Buckeye State* ascended the Welland Canal locks and stood out into the St. Lawrence, the exact trip she had been designed to make. On April 23rd, she arrived in Boston and unloaded the last of the cargo from Cleveland. Shortly thereafter, the crew received word that the Canadian government had ordered that no ships sailing to or from the Syndicalist controlled states would be permitted to use Canadian facilities, including the Welland Canal, effectively meaning that the *Buckeye State* would not be able to return home. Angered by this, and the fact that Matheson and his clique had not paid the large bonuses they had promised, there were grumblings of mutiny among the ship\u2019s crew. \n\nThe last straw came on the 29th of April, when the ship was sailing in ballast to Providence, Rhode Island. After a stop at Martha\u2019s vineyard, a rumour spread among the crew that the *Buckeye State,* being relatively fast and fairly new, would likely be seized by the Navy of the New England regime for use as an auxiliary. Incensed at the thought of giving up their ship to the \u201cBenedict Arnolds,\u201d the crew abandoned their orders, hoisted a red flag on the *Buckeye State*, and sailed her into Long Island Sound, intent on throwing in their lot with the Combined Syndicates of America. \n\nTo be continued...",

        "(Part 1)\n\nI invite you to pull up a chair, get cozy, I want to tell you a story.  It looks like a long story, but rest assured, this is the abridged version:\n\nOnce upon a time, on the PvP server: Darktide, in or around 2003 or 2004, the exact date is unimportant, a guild named Underworld-Dreams was formed.  It started with one Zachary Bosh, known as Boiling Point in game at the time, and his real life friend named Underworld-Dreams.  Eventually they settled on the guild name Dynasty of Amber, but the monarchy was commonly known as Underworld-Dreams or \u2018UD\u2019 by most even to present day.\n\nAn important point, which is quite valid by simple admission of their history: This guild drew in nearly all the more skilled, yet less moral and ethical players.  Everyone knows the type, we\u2019re talking about the kids that are skilled players and they say a lot of very inappropriate stuff.  What I\u2019m suggesting is the guild aptly named \u2018Underworld-Dreams\u2019 became THE cesspool monarchy of THE cesspool server of Asheron\u2019s Call.  \n\nHere is what \u2018UD\u2019s\u2019 quickly established on Darktide: \n\nThey consumed each other from the inside frequently, they scammed one another, stole, stripped accounts, deleted accounts, and then they would blame the person they considered the least valuable to their community as a scapegoat, eject them from their guild.  A so called \u2018hacker group\u2019  existed within them.  The hacker group could do or say anything, Zachary Bosh wasn\u2019t kicking them out.   They supplied him with unlimited AC resources of the highest tier.   They all ran the same series of duped gear whenever they could get away with it.\n\nLet\u2019s rewind again: I joined UD very early in their history.  I was either a chain organizer or a co-leader of various smaller guilds leading up to Throne of Destiny launch, at ToD launch Decal was down for a few months.  At this time I co-led a group of about 8 players who all lived within about a two hour range in the Lake Erie NY/PA area of the USA.  We moved into the only Egg Orchard at the time.  We were very active players and very driven to achieve a level and gear advantage with the new 275 cap and the new Level 7 Loot Tier.    The leader of UD, Zachary Bosh, and only a very small number of UD\u2019s were active and competing with us in Egg Orchard, most players on Darktide went inactive without Decal.   Leading up to ToD launch, UDs had far more actives and we couldn\u2019t contest a resource with them, and we knew if more of their players became active, they\u2019d have an advantage in EO.  So when they invited us to merge into UD.  We accepted.\n\nWithin a couple weeks it was clear to me I couldn\u2019t stay in the guild.   The topics in their Ventrilo frequently ranged from bizarre and off-color, to completely psychopathic deranged expression of murder, pedophilia, necrophiliacs and other disgusting sex fantasy.   My own mother overheard the owner of the Underworld-Dreams account screaming about murdering and raping the corpse in a tone and context that didn\u2019t sound anything but serious.   I was taunted and ridiculed for years by Underworld-Dream\u2019s guild  for speaking of this incident to others.  At the time I found it hilarious that my mother\u2019s admonishment was joked about in the community honestly.  I didn\u2019t understand to what level these kids were actually deranged.\n\nSo after about a month of being in UD, I knew I wasn\u2019t sticking around. I was trying to find a balance between just wanting to play a video game and benefit from a monarchy\u2019s resource control, and dealing with the burden of being in the middle of a group of intensely and legitimately deranged and seemingly dangerous alleged psychopaths.  \n\nI discovered one of the guys who I did have a longish gaming history, with whom I\u2019d dined at his parent\u2019s house, with his whole family, did steal a bunch of items from both myself and my long standing AC friend known as Opal Virindi.  We left UD, UD then went on a massive campaign to slander me, call me a liar over the theft, and just generally attempt to cause me as much trouble as they could.  They designed subversive campaigns which they called upon the whole of their guild to enact, every time I spoke within the DT community in /GC, and also on VNBoards.  I couldn\u2019t make a trade post without hearing about how my wife had sex with a black guy and now by baby is half black, or any other of a dozen personal attacks they designed to harass me.  Illservian\u2019s Wrath did ectually admit what he did and apologize, which Zachary Bosh and Underworld-Dreams under his command did regent and continue to claim I was lying just to slander his guild.  It was all very bizarre and even somewhat frustrating.   But it\u2019s just a game right?\n\n(Part 1)",

        "Manhattan B-reactor tours. One of the reactors used to make plutonium for the Manhattan project. They've taken out the radioactive bits. You drive out on a bus and take a guided tour through the reactor. Leaves from Richland, you have to make reservations in advance.\n\nLIGO, as mentioned, is interesting, but they don't have tours all that often.\n\nMuch of the interesting local geology is a result of two things: first, the magma hotspot currently under yellowstone used to be here, and caused the largest known surface lava flows in the world. You'll see lots of columnar basalt, which is what happens when twenty-foot deep basalt lava pools slowly cool and crystalize, then get layered one on top of another. The reason you see the columnar basalt is the ice age floods; the Missoula glacier formed an ice dam, which trapped a body of water the size of lake Erie. As the glacier melted, flowing water carved a channel in the dam, causing the entirety of lake Missoula to empty out into the Columbia river basin over the course of three days. This event repeated itself dozens of times over a number of ice ages.\n\nWhite bluffs: 40 minute drive, sand and sandstone bluffs overlooking the Columbia River. No facilities. You can see the shuttered reactors from there. [https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/white-bluffs-south](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/white-bluffs-south) \n\nTwin sisters: 30 minute? drive. An interesting rock formation off the columbia river you can hike around. No facilities. Windy. There's another car stop very near here you can access the cliff-top area above the river. You could probably hike for hours; I didn't see any fences. You pass the McNary wildlife refuge on the way here, which has an interpretive center and some hiking I believe. [https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/twin-sisters-rock](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/twin-sisters-rock)\n\nGinko petrified forest: a little over an hour. Hiking around stumps of petrified trees, a cool visitor center with a gallery of petrified wood, and a rock and gem shop.  [https://parks.state.wa.us/288/Ginkgo-Petrified-Forest](https://parks.state.wa.us/288/Ginkgo-Petrified-Forest) It's near the bridge across the Columbia river at vantage; we usually stop on the way somewhere further. Along the drive, there are a few river access points, the Wanapum dam interpretive center (never been), lots of nice columnar basalt cliffs, a country diner or two, a sand dune you can play in (never stopped), and a ton of orchards.\n\nPalouse falls: about 2 hours. an impressive ice-age-flood columnar basalt slot canyon waterfall you can hike into, maybe a 45-minute hike, with an additional section of hiking to the bottom of the waterfall for the daring (I have never been). You can't exactly swim but there are places you can wade in the water. Much of the drive here is a bit desolate, you're going through dryland wheat, and there may still be evidence of the wildfires a couple of years back. The drive is worth it though. Palouse falls was formed when the floods diverted the river; you'll drive through the old coulee (river canyon with no river in it) on the way there.\n\nDry falls (also about two hours away) is supposed to be even better (four times the size of Niagara falls, but without the water), but I haven't been there so I can't say.\n\nMaryhill Museum: about two hours. A wealthy industrialist built a large mansion in the middle of nowhere, on top of the cliffs of one of the cliffiest parts of the Columbia gorge. It's an art museum now, and for being in the middle of nowhere, a pretty good one. A Rembrandt section, a Norwegian royal furniture section, a local native tribal art section, a children's section, and a collection of weird chess sets. You can picnic and walk around the grounds. It's right next door to the Maryhill winery, which in addition to wine has food, bocce ball, and sometimes live music. They have an amphitheatre and sometimes have concerts. If you go here, I recommend coming back by going up the Roosevelt incline and stopping at Prosser; you'll get to drive through a windmill farm and see some interesting clifftop countryside. Prosser has some decent restaurant options and a ton of wineries; the few times I've been it seems to mostly close up at five. \n\nIf you are willing to go about two hours you can start to get into the mountains: those areas would be the Wenatchee National forest, the Umatilla national forest, and the Wenaha-Tucannon wilderness. If you stretch to a little over three hours and make a day of it you can visit Mt Rainier, an active supervolcano, the U.S.'s most prominent mountain and one of the tallest.",

        "What I'd say are the \"most Buffalo things to do\" would be:\n\n1. Wings:\n\n* **Gabriel's Gate**.  If you're in the city -  Probably best wing closest to downtown. Allentown\n* **Nine Eleven Tavern.** If you're in the city but don't mind hoping in the car for a few miles -  Incredible wings and personal all time favorite. Might take awhile to get wings. Get the fries too). South Buffalo\n* **Bar Bill.** If you wan't to travel outside the city to a further out suburb.  A fav among locals. They also have Beef on Weck which is also a popular Buffalo sandwich. You would be able to kill two birds with one stone here. East Aurora.\n\nHonorable mentions: **Duff's** (reliable), **Anchor Bar** (Historic).\n\nTips: Blue cheese with wings, never ranch.\n\n2) Beer / Breweries\n\n* Big Ditch Brewery - Downtown\n* Community Beer Works Brewery - Lower West Side\n* 42 North Brewery -  In East Aurora (same as Bar Bill).\n* Thin Man Brewery - Located on a walkable commercial street. Elmwood.\n* Founding Father's - Fun atmosphere, historic/history themed. Downtown/Allentown\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3) Architecture/tours - Lots of great buildings downtown\n\n* Frank Lloyd Wrights Darwin Martin House - Parkside/North Buffalo\n* Downtown - Just walk around or you can take a tour through Explore Buffalo\n* Buffalo Bike Tour - If you're a bike rider or want to cover a more  ground than walking i'd highly recommend them. Canalside\n* Silo City - Out city once was a huge point for grain traveling across the country. Buffalo is no longer a hub for that but the Silos that once held the grain remain. Very unique experience to see .\n* Hotel Henry - Old insane asylum turned into a boutique hotel. Beautiful building and if you're looking for a place to stay the rooms are also beautiful.  Elmwood.\n* Allentown Neighborhood - Fun to walk around and take in a beautiful neighborhood.\n* City Hall - Beautiful art deco building. Free vantage point elevator to the top. You can look around and get a 360 view of the entire city. Downtown\n\n1. Where to stay\n\n* Hotel Henry - Elmwood area\n* Marriot Courtyard /Harbor Center -  Canalside/ Cobblestone District\n* Hostel Buffalo - Cheaper option, nice and accommodating staff.\n* Air BnB\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5) Other Good Foods in the Area\n\n* Ballyhoo - Great drinks (get a Jam Session), great sausage (TJ Dwag is my favorite ), and great mac and cheese. Near Cobblestone District\n* Public Espresso - Coffee shop with great pasties. Downtown\n* Remedy House - Great cafe with incredible pastries. Five Points neighborhood.\n* Chicken Finger Sub - Cafe 59. Chicken Finger sub is also a local Buffalo thing that i'd die for.  Allentown\n* Breadhive - Bakery/cafe with delicious homemade bagels, soft pretzels, and bread.  West Side/Five Points.\n* Marble + Rye - Farm To Table new American food. Downtown\n* Las Puertas - Fancier farm to table modern Mexican (super unique place if you're looking for a fancy diner while out). Five Points neighborhood.\n* Lucky Day Whisky Bar - If you like Whisky this is your place. Great atmosphere (probably not for a Bills afterparty though). Downtown.\n* Jays Artisan Pizza - Wood oven. They mill their own flour and ferment the dough overnight. Get the square Detroit style pizza. Kenmore/North Buffalo\n* Bocce Club - Classic cup and char pepperoni buffalo style pizza. Suburbs\n* Imperial Pizza - Classic cup and char pepperoni buffalo style pizza. South Buffalo\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6) Other Things:\n\n* Kayak at Canalside to see the Silos by water. Canalside\n* Albright Knox Art Gallery - Elmwood\n* Pierce-Arrow Museum - If you're into old cars. Downtownish\n* Naval Park - If you're into war ships.  Canalside\n* Spirit of Buffalo - Sail boat ride onto lake Erie. Canalside\n* Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural National Historic Site - Never been but if you're a history person it's for you. Allentown\n* Niagara Falls\n* And of course, The Ralph.\n* There're  a ton more that I can't think of right now.\n\nNote: Smell the air close to downtown, it might smell like Cheerios or Trix (they bake them close to Silo City).",

Claude Danielson stands carrying a microphone, with the large and imposing Mac Candor by his side. Claude's probably doing that interviewer thing where he slides his legs to the side. Claude speaks in his authoritative voice that sounds very old.*\n\n**CD**: Hello QWF \"gang\", it's me, \"ya boi\", QWF interviewer Claude Geronimo Danielson. I'm here with \"the Mammoth\" Mac Candor, fresh off recovery from A Champion Is You. Now, you must be excited with how everything turned out last Sunday.\n\n**MC**: I have to admit, I didn't get all the way in the tournament, Claude, that's true, but I am proud of the way I went out there and gave it my all.

Anyways, you can tell that William Graves is in my head.\n\n**CD**: That's evident, Macauley. \n\n**MC**: William, I know you're a good wrestler. We both know that. You were one of the top tag teams in America, no, the world. And even though I threatened to murder your family, straight-up, like thirty seconds ago, I respect your wrestling ability. I respect the way you can act in this ring. \n\nThe thing I don't respect? It's you, Will. I saw you wrestle. I saw the way you could have been. I've been following somebody like you since the beginning, William. A Lake Erie boy, just like me, making his way in this business and proving that he deserves to be here. I knew you could have been a great wrestler, from the beginning, Graves. I knew you could have been the best in the goddamn world.\n\nAnd then you started cheating. And It broke my fucking heart, Will. It broke my heart to see somebody like you, with so much potential to do it the *right* way, take away their own place among the greats. Sure, you've won gold and money and fame, but at what cost, Will? Was it worth it, to focus on trash talk over getting it done in the ring? Was it worth it?\n\nWe're gonna find out this Tuesday Night, William. I'm gonna take you to the limit, whether you're ready to go there or not. I respect everything you could do and could have done, Will. I know not many people like us, in communities that are hurting more and more every day, get the chance to be the best. But I know you could have been. I know you could have been the greatest hero this business ever had.\n\nMaybe this seems overdramatic, but I was there for your first match in Buffalo. At the edge of the crowd, so nobody could see me, as if they would care. I saw myself in you, kid. You broke my heart and, if the only way to prove to you that you can be better is to beat it out of you, then I'm gonna beat it out of you, Will. \n\nSee you Tuesday, Graves. Let's make it count.\n\n*Mac walks out of frame, leaving only Claude as the camera cuts out. The last thing we see and hear is Danielson mutter \"murder his family\".*",

He did a year in bradford.\n\nUsed to redbox pay phones using a tape deck, or an xmas card, or a tone generator from radio shake that you replace a crystal on. Quarter tones played into the phone and calls made.\n\nUsed to hack ld services. 950s and shit. I'd clip on to the neighbors line and run a code hacker all night. Lived in the projects; Outside boxes served 2 apartments. Would sell codes. When hacking conference services we would sell them to russians who wanted to call home.\n\nI used to have an acoustic coupler that we used on payphones. This got me laid once. This girl was so into computers, hacking, and shit that we hit it off and had a nice fling together.\n\nIn the 80s i used to build random explosive devices. These never destroyed property or hurt anyone other than a tree. We all thought the world was ending... hack/phreak/anarchy was a scene... some people just passed around text files, I tried them, and in some cases called bullshit on them before hand. Boiled down 10 gallons of piss as a teenager to process with car battery acid to make urine nitrate which i made into a pipe bomb with some other ingredients. Several times I also walked the projects with a flame thrower I made.\n\nThe one that gets the most idiots coming out is accidental anal. I'm doing this girl doggie style with a condom on. I slide out, go back in, and she says that's different... It takes a moment to realize where I was, I pull out, get a new condom and we o back to it. Ass up, head down, relax, and the asshole opens up on most people. I knew this because I discovered it as a kid and used it to 'make farts'. Head down, ass up, open up your ass, then clench and you are loaded, go fart little brother. But people who think they know shit go batshit crazy saying no way. Even in real life. They they start trying to insult the girl... She was 18 literally fresh out of high school. I met her the summer she graduated. She was cute, black, smart... and took to me (22) over a week of being part of conversations at Coventry Arabica, a coffee shop that people dont believe existed either. In the 90s it was were the cool people hung out. Theater actors, writers for the free times, students from CWRU, people from the area (in the 90s it was voted most diverse area), old people, young people... a doctor, lawyer, skater punk, riotgirl lesbian, and so on woul be playing hacky sack, drinking coffee, discussing politics, philosophy, music, computers (2600 meetings; and computer people were seen as cool), musicians, artists... anyways... When I mentioned I thought she was hot she waited until we were alone and kissed me... we had a short relationship... after the relationship she is randomly walking up the street while i am on my porch... she comes up, I offer her coffee... and we're in my bed... and then accidental buttsex happens.\n\nA lesser one... I solved THe Secret Of Monkey Island in 6 hours. No one believes this. Same with Ultima i (it was the remake on the c64, and simant on the PC; complete 100%. Lawn filled and house filled before the people moved out!)\n\nTaught an 8 year old girl how to weld with my wire feed welder. I also struck my first weld at 8. My grandfather was a welder. I the 70s this was just a normal thing. A teacher on reddit was insistent that I was a liar.\n\ncoventry, cleveland, arabica... an american translating english to english for a scottish man and an arcadian man. crazy funny.\n\nPeople bursting out in song and dance... on coventry this was a thing. I dont know how many times I saw a particular group singing tiny toons. Appears this is not a thing anywhere elese in anyone's life.\n\nIf you call the projects the projects I am told you didnt grow up there; yet I did. Goofy shit people believe.\n\nDated a large breasted korean girl. Bit her on the neck in the first 10 minutes of knowing her. People assume there are no large breasted asians, and other parts of the story, like her telling me she tried to drown someone when she was 10, were totally bs.\n\nI say something random and some idiot goes /r/thatHappened... there is always some shithead who hasnt lived life who thinks some random shit isnt true... most of my coventry stories...\n\nedit: I was on a conference call... Someone had turned an agents phone into a pay phone via social engineering. She called into our conference and said 'what, you think I cant red box?' We were all watched for a while. Was funny when we all entered IT... some people didnt stop certain things. My boss got a call once by the feds asking about the guy who had turned the agents phone into a payphone, related to other hacking. Also knew a guy who hacked 'to find aliens' who was busted for CP... he use the CP to black male people. He'd put it in their DIR, or on a system, I dont know the rest of these details, but I know someone was deported in the 90s because of it.\n\nI never blue boxed. It was dead by that time.\n\nThe BBS scene... it was the pre-internet online world. I used to call it modemia but it only caught on with a small circle of people. We used to have parties that were fucking crazy. The halloween parties for my BBS were in the woods. We would have an opening ceremony/skit and lit the on fire. One year a girl drug her BF out of the party screaming we were all satanists. The party would include my local friends and my online friends. 87 to 92... with some summer parties sometimes. My brother and his friends dug a pit for bb gun wars... it was full of leaves and one year it was a pit of lust... like 6 people making out and trying to get on eachother... someone would crawl out and someone would crawl in...\n\nFreenet picnics were tame compared... other BBS had cool parties and cook outs too. A weird mix of adult and minors. As far as I am aware of nothing illegal, but some 17 year olds did hook up with some 18+s, which is legal in ohio.\n\nCaught a HUGE carp with my bare hands in lake erie...  \n\n\nedit... so I'm at a party and there is a 17 year old guy and an 18 year old Chinese refuge who was brought here when he was 8 playing chess. Both strong members of he social circle (we called it the pack). The white guy goes to the fridge and grabs steak sauce. Come back, takes off his socks, pours the sauce over his toes, and starts sucking them. There are like 15-20 people in the apartment at this hour. The asian kid guys why you do that,the guy replies because it turns me on. THEY KEPT PLAYING CHESS!  \n\n\nThen there is guy who bet everyone $10 he could suck his own dick... I think he won like $100+ but was never seen again.",

        "The Niagara Gorge is supposed to be a crazy haunted place. Niagara Falls had this image as being this beautiful place, the Honeymoon capital of the world at one point, but the Native American tribes that originally lived in this area had a lot of negative legends for it and thought of it as being dangerous and cursed. The god of thunder and storms lived in a cave behind the Falls, the Maid of the Mist was Lelawala, who sacrificed herself to him by going over the falls in a canoe. While it is possible that you can live going over the falls unprotected (I believe  5? people have in recorded history), there are different versions of the story where she lived after the thunder god managed to save her or others where she disappeared into the rapids.\n\nAt the other end of the gorge is Devils Hole. The Seneca tribe viewed the Devils Hole ravine and cave as a portal into the underworld (almost sort of like a parallel to the falls giving life and being the heart of the river). Everyone knows about the Devils Hole Massacre but most people don't know how it actually went down. Basically the Senecas where being used as a labor on the  lucrative Niagara shipping portage but then the British gave the exclusive contract to John Stedman (one of the city of NF's fathers and a real crooked villian in WNY history, IMO).  He basically wrecked the gorge paths, by widening them for heavy carriages and cutting down trees, then stopped using the Seneca's for their labor.\n\nAround this time, Pontiac's Rebellion was starting on the Great Lakes. The Seneca's plan was to hijack a British convoy heading from Fort Niagara to Fort Schlosser (where the NYPA water intakes now our on the upper river) to stop the shipment of supplies out to Fort Detroit on the Western edge of Lake Erie. The rebellion was laying siege to the Fort and wanted to stop the shipment of supplies from reaching there, the whole act of causing terror by attacking the convoy was an added bonus.\n\nThe Seneca's fucked up though and the initial convoy's carriages/wagons were empty with supplies (they just dropped a load off at Fort Niagara and were headed back to the upper river). So the initial attack was a waste and ended  up just being a free for all, with a shit ton of soldiers and porters getting scalped, killed and tossed down into the ravine. There was actually a second wave of the attack that was worse, a battalion of British reservists heard the commotion coming from up river and rushed to the scene. The Seneca's came out of the woods and then they were also scalped, killed and tossed down into the ravine. The whole thing was over in  about 45 minutes. One of the fucked up things about it was that some of the bodies were caught up and stuck in hard to reach places down in the gorge, so they weren't able to get retrieved and were just left there to rot. There are stories of people exploring the ravine/gorge decades later and still being able to find or see skeletons that were all fucked up and just out of reach. I wonder how many are still left there and buried under all the talus rubble (although it seems like the hydroplant was built right where most of the attack actually happened, I am hazy on this, I read a lot of different material on the attack and witnesses put it all over the area near the ravine). The name of the little  seasonal waterfall there, the Bloody Run, came from it running red from all the dead bodies that piled up.\n\nOne little boy managed to survive by getting tossed close to the edge and hiding out in a bush. Another survivor was John Stedman. His story was that he tried to fight back gallantly but was overwhelmed and rode off. Seneca's who were involved in the raid later said that he was a coward and immediately took on his horse. Either way, he followed Gill creek all the way up to Fort Schlosser and reported what happened. A short while later, when the British were trying to work out reparations for the attack, he managed to convince Lord Amherst's people to have King George deed him all the land between Gil Creek and the Niagara river. Back in Britain, they didn't realize how large the area and important the area actually was and gave him control over what would first be called Manchester and than the city of Niagara Falls. That's how the city was founded, literally on a lie and taking advantage of one of the most infamous points in WNY's history.\n\nDevils Hole lore doesn't end there though. The other famous story is of President McKinley and Teddy Roosevelt. Before visiting the Pan Am Expo, they rode the Great Gorge Trolley up to the ravine. McKinley wanted to check out the site of the massacre and see the cave, but Teddy Roosevelt was superstitious and followed local native stories, so he refused to go up the ravine and go inside the cave. After McKinley was done, they went to visit the falls and then out to Buffalo, where hours later he was shot by an anarchist assassin. The story of how Teddy Roosevelt found out he was going to become President is just as crazy and fun, if anyone wants to hear it or look it up.\n\nWilliam McKinley being a fuckwad and going in that cave cursed Buffalo and directly led to 4 Super Bowl losses, the 1999 Stanley Cup No Goal, The Music City Miracle, Nikola Tesla going crazy, Goo Goo Dolls going light rock, OJ Simpson, James Kopp and Timothy McVeigh. I am just saying.\n\nBut it doesn't end there. The Great Gorge Trolley eventually had to end after several bad derailments and accidents happened. Because of the ravine and the way the river bends there, it was a tricky part for the train to go through and at least two major accidents resulting in large scale death happened. The last one was in the 1920's I believe, but I am not sure off hand. There was also at least one time where the trolley had shit dumped on it when it was passing near a sewage hole that the city used (I am pretty sure that this is still there and if you have been hiking along the Devils Hole trail you would know where it's at).\n\nThat ravine and bend in the river is also one of the hotspots where a lot the bodies that go over the Falls end up. Niagara Falls has a lot f suicides, like a lot. They often go unreported in the news, but locals here about them and they are open secret in WNY. Last I knew, the Buffalo News had an article where there were 13 active cold cases related to bodies found in the lower river (but most end up getting identified).  Between the Whirlpool and  Devils Hole is where some of the river's fastest rapids happen, so there is a lot of drowning deaths. About a decade ago, a little Polish girl fell in and drowned, a jet skier drowned there just this summer.\n\nThen there is the Schoellkopf power station collapse that happened in the 1950s. The hydro-electric plant was built on an unstable portion of the gorge wall with a lot of ground water (you can still see a lot of natural springs in that area today) and water began gushing into the hydro-plant from behind the gorge wall. A worker managed to notice it and get almost  everyone out, but was the only one to die once the plant collapsed. A lot of the ruins from the hydroplant are still down there today and it's a cool place to check out. If you hike that trail (leading from the Gorge Discovery Center and Aquarium), there is all sorts of pieces of steel and concrete sticking out of the ground leading up to where the plant was. There is also a bunch of smashed up cars/trucks hanging in the trees and around the big boulders from a big car accident that happened back during the 1970s. It can be a really creepy place to check out, especially at night when you aren't sure if there are people partying or living down there.",

        "One, I think there is little evidence that Britain would want the Americas to return. But let\u2019s assume they did. \n\nThe war was declared by America in 1812- and from there for two years the campaign was marked mostly by American failures to invade Canada (with the exception of gaining control of Lake Erie). British attempts to invade America via Canada has also failed; raids was all they could do (including the destruction of Washington). \n\nI can only assume that based on the timeframe you gave that opposition to the war in 1812 was much greater and somehow this translated into betrayal of America by those who opposed the war. \n\nSo let\u2019s assume (somehow) this happened. New England (where opposition was strongest)  would be the region where support for Britain was strongest. \n\nQuickly it would see Loyalist forces (Loyal to the USA that is) rise up in opposition. British control would be limited to the extremities (New Orleans in the South, New England in the north). \n\nEffectively the Loyalists would gain control over the rest. Canadian troops even with New Englander help would be unable to prosecute the war south, and the Americans would grow in power. \n\nUnder this scenario, the Loyalists would take New Orleans still and no doubt have declared the surrender null and void. Fighting in New England would be intense, vicious and no doubt food for propaganda for both sides. \n\nHowever post 1814, there is a change. Napoleon abdicates. This frees up a vast body of British troops. With the opportunity to gain the Americas coupled with no doubt lurid tales of atrocities in New England, the British may well send the main body of troops it had to Canada- Wellington\u2019s Army of the Peninsular. \n\nSchooled hard by years of fighting the best forces in Europe; experienced in operating in hostile territory; filled with hard earned knowledge of utilising small local militia as a force multiplier; with a proven track record in movement/logistics/morale excellence as well as containing way more riflemen units (the weapon advantage the Americans had over the Canadians) this would be the game changer. \n\nThe Loyalists would have nothing and no one to match this. If given time, Wellington\u2019s army able to group and build out of New England, it would have made mince meat out of the Loyalists. \n\nIt would have been brutal; the systematic destruction of damn near all US land forces sent to meet him. \n\nHowever- Britain would have to face one inescapable fact; the States are just too damn big for one army to control like that. Wellington\u2019s domination in Spain was only a facet of the wider European strategy against the Corsican. \n\nWhile a Wellington led campaign would win every battle it would come no closer to winning the war (by the way- Wellington was no military genius; far from it; he was just disciplined and his men were battle hardened). \n\nAs time goes by Loyalist forces get better (losing a lot is the best military education after all). Vast swathes of the States remain out of British control. Costs mount. Wellington\u2019s army suffers form attrition and new elements are not as good. \n\nPolitical support for an extended campaign dries up in Britain. \n\nSo peace would come about. The most Britain would hope for (and would probably get) is the New England region returns to British control. Relations between the two nations sour considerably for quite some time. \n\nAmerican armed forces are stronger and more unified. Indeed having suffered as such one wonders how later debates which divided America would have gone. And indeed later conflicts between the two nations (such as the desire for the US to claim all of Oregon territory including the parts in Canada) may well resorted in violence. \n\nAlso worth noting- in the above situation? The moment Napoleon returned from Elba? It is possible the Loyalists would have announced huge support for him, and also possible Wellington being tied up in Canada/New England means the Corsican is able to fulfil his plan to destroy the allied armies one by one and thus prevent Waterloo. \n\nMeaning a potential world were the restored Napoleon is allied to an anti-British United States, still smarting over the loss of New England. \n\nMaybe... wonderful \u2018what if\u2019/alternative history fodder.

        "We just went at the end of September and it\u2019s an amazing place. \n\nGet a passport or the passport card so you can visit Canada. They don\u2019t need it but you\u2019ll need it coming back into the USA. You will NOT regret it. It\u2019s worth the cost of the passport just to see the Canadian side view. \n\nThe Canadian side is really nice although a touch touristy.  You can get within feet of the rushing waters of Horseshoe falls and it\u2019s incredible. \n\nOn the US side, there is a park on Goat Island that\u2019s really nice. Good views of Bridal Veil falls and the rest of the American side falls. There are foot bridges to walk across to the American shore and you can get fairly close to the falls. \n\nWind Cave will be closed. \n\nThe Maid of the Mist may not be running; I can\u2019t tell you for sure. \n\nDefinitely go on the overlook where you go down to the maid of the mist. It\u2019s the beat view from the American side. \n\nHonestly, we were there on a four day trip from Virginia. We left Thursday and returned Sunday. \n\nWe got there about 3pm and dropped our stuff off at the Airbnb we used. We piled into the car and headed for the falls. \n\nYou can see the most from the falls a good half mile away, which is impressive. It also gives you a little thrill because you know that something big is happening there and you\u2019re about to see it. \n\nWe drove over the Rainbow Bridge and got our first views of the falls. Words don\u2019t do it justice. Pictures and videos only hint at the power and beauty. \n\nWe stopped at the scenic overlooks on the Canadian side and enjoyed the views of the falls. They\u2019re illuminated at night and it\u2019s really cool. We then went to Smoke\u2019s Poutine because we love poutine. After that we walked around Clifton Hill (the touristy area) and got a few souvenirs. \n\nNote that in the whole area, be prepared to pay to park. The costs aren\u2019t too bad but they go up on the weekend. We spent evenings in Canada for dinner. \n\nThe first day full day we went to Goat Island and down to Wind Cave. When the season is right they build a deck that goes right up to bridal veil falls and you can get soaked from the water coming over the falls. In the winter that\u2019s not an option, but you can walk over to see Horseshoe falls from the American side, or walk over to the American side of the falls. There\u2019s well paved paths and bridges to see the river and falls from quite a few angles. From the American falls you can\u2019t really see Horseshoe falls. \n\nWe walked over to the American falls and went down to the Maid of the Mist. It\u2019s not cheap but it\u2019s a great value for the experience it provides. If they\u2019re running I highly recommend it \u2014 they go right up inside the curve or Horseshoe falls and you get a rough 225\u00b0 panoramic view of the falls. You\u2019re nearly completely surrounded by crashing water. Huge amounts of crashing water. Its amazing. \n\nAfterwards we went and dried off and got lunch. We chose to go into Canada for the afternoon and drive to St Catherine\u2019s for dinner. It\u2019s a short drive and worth the trip. It\u2019s less touristy and St C is a beautiful town. It was early enough that we stopped into a Canadian grocery store just to see how it differed from the American experience. \n\nWe had a little more time before dinner, so we drove up to Sunset Beach on Lake Ontario and dipped our toes into the lake, just to be able to say we\u2019d been there. \n\nThe next day we had plans to do a little hiking, so we hit the US side parks. \n\nOn the US side Niagara State Park has some nice and easy trails, but we went down to Whirlpool state park and hiked Whirlpool trail, which goes down to some flat rocks near the end of the rapids in the gorge. The hike down is fairly easy but it\u2019s ~200 feet of Stairs to get back up out of the gorge. Be prepared for it if you go. \n\nThe Whirlpool is a big basin where the river makes a 90 degree bend, and the cross flows put the water in the basin into a circular flow. I don\u2019t know how it\u2019ll be in winter but it was beautiful in the fall, and you can see the rapids (the only Class 6 rapids in the world) up close. \n\nAfter the long climb out we were tired and took a rest before heading back over to Canada to visit Horseshoe falls. Parking was the most expensive here \u2014 $20CAD, about $15USD. \n\nThis is probably the most spectacular place at the top of the falls. The amount of water going over the falls is incredible\u2014 Lake Erie basically drains through the falls and into Lake Ontario. \n\nThe most from Horseshoe falls was blowing onto the Canadian side and creating a localized rain shower on the shore above the falls. It was freaky and cool all at the same time. We braved the crowds to get to the closest approach to the falls, an overlook that allows you to look straight down into the river just above the falls, and into the basin of Horseshoe falls. I was entranced. My wife had to drag me away. \n\nAfter that we wandered around Clifton Hill again and enjoyed a beer and a burger at one of the restaurants. Eventually we headed back to the Airbnb and packed to go home. \n\nWe left the next morning for the drive back to Virginia. \n\nI hope my little travelogue helps.",

A lot of shitty stuff happening around the world, identity crisis, lost all my friends, my cat died, mental health in the shitter. Memes were dank tho.\n\nBest moments: epic 500-person snowball fight, spent a night mixing random alcohols with my friends, slept in a cemetery, was in the middle of a city during a championship win\n\n\u2022 2017 rediscovered my identity and passions, second-best year of my life. Traveled again, memes getting danker, made lots of new friends, gained prestige through leadership positions in clubs and shit, wrote another book, got my first internship, did unbelievable things I didn\u2019t think I was capable of, went from introvert to extrovert in one wild summer.\n\nBest moments: ran for office at my school, was billeted in an awesome house during a sports competition; saw Turandot; watched four different Fourth of July fireworks shows at once, climbed 200 stories of a skyscraper in a day and then drank whiskey at the top during sunset; ran a half marathon; got laser eye surgery; spent a week on the coast in Italy; stayed up all night with my friend walking in the rain; went to the Lincoln Memorial at 2 AM; best party of my life; competed in a biathalon; turned 21\n\n\u2022 2018 was a meh year. Didn\u2019t really do the things I wanted to do. Studied abroad in Eastern Europe but it was mediocre because I didn\u2019t like Poland too much. Had an ok internship at a nice-enough company. My passions stagnated and didn\u2019t have much social luck. Entered senior year of college and continued benefiting from prestige but not as much.\n\nBest moments: Eagles Super Bowl win, spent a surreal week in South Carolina (best week of my life), drank a fifth of Remy Martin with a buddy, dropped acid, saw an opera in Prague; defrauded the Italian train system; bought molly (but then resold it) from some random dude in Barcelona; raced crabs; tried coke for the first time; fried bacon in the rain; listened to The Planets and smoked with my roommate on a balcony for two hours; got a free fifth of Jagermeister; benefited from a mass shooting (it was super fucked up but also a great two days); wrestled my buddy; ultramarathoned (would NOT recommend it); broke into my high school on New Year\u2019s Eve and spent it alone in there\n\n\u2022 2019 has been a mixed bag and it\u2019s impossible to judge yet. Went *bonkers* with senioritis in spring and partied way too much, just barely missed honors graduation, big regret. Wrapped up college clubs unsatisfactorily. Got my first real job at an actual company and made a lot of money but didn\u2019t care for corporate environment and quit. Now I\u2019m starting a different career entirely next month and I\u2019m super anxious.\n\nBest moments: a drug pi\u00f1ata at a party; fifth and a friend; launching water balloons a thousand feet in South Carolina; breaking an athletic barrier I\u2019ve always wanted to beat; my fraternity formal; winning the shirt off another man\u2019s back at a competition; blacking out for the first time; moon landing anniversary celebrations; playing street hockey with my friends; seeing my favorite movie on the big screen during a re-release\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nIf I had to sum up this decade, it gave me tons of experience with life. I started the 2010s as a timid eighth grader who\u2019d never kissed a girl and was friends with the losers in the band room, but ended it a recent college graduate who changed his entire life and outlook on it in this decade. Went to the gym, got more luck with the girls, can hold a drink and crack a joke, but still depressed and lonely most of the time, and absolutely full of existential dread. What do the 2020s hold? I don\u2019t know. The furthest I\u2019m looking into the future is six months.\n\nI\u2019ve always wanted to go to law school. We\u2019re five months out from college graduation and most of my friends are already 1Ls. I hope I become a lawyer in the 2020s. I hope I take my dream vacation to Slovenia. I hope I get married. I will be 23-33 in the next decade, and I know it\u2019s my last chance to experience youth.",

        "I\u2019m on the east coast of Florida in Indian River County, the red tide on the west coast made it to me last fall, basically around and up the coast from the Gulf. I\u2019ve been very involved in several organizations addressing water issues in my area. Working with local politicians, organizing, and educating. So I\u2019m happy to rant a little bit about them. \n\nAlgae Blooms are happening all over the world at a rate hitherto unseen. Rising temperatures and climate change are exacerbating them and we as modern peoples are woefully unprepared for their impacts. \n\nPotable water sources all over are imperiled and strained by them. An example is [in Lake Erie and water taken from there. ](https://www.wxyz.com/news/giant-algae-bloom-returns-to-lake-erie-threatens-drinking-water). Most water treatment plants do not currently treat water for certain bacteria caused by the blooms. Cyanobacteria is an example of this. Getting it out of drinking water requires specialized treatment which many plants do not use as they\u2019ve never needed it before. This is expanded on in a very scary but interesting documentary called [The Toxic Puzzle.](https://www.toxicpuzzle.com/)\n\nOne of the biggest causes of the blooms is nutrient pollution (especially nitrogen and prosperous) and the best way to stop them is to stop nutrient pollution. Easier said then done though. Pretty much just our living our 21st century lives causes nutrient pollution. In Florida our population grows by about 900 people per day. We\u2019re reaching the tipping point in many of our waterways. (As an aside, add in the archaic Florida water permitting laws and republican crony stacked water management districts and we have huge problems.) \n\nMoney is the biggest thing stopping us from addressing real issues. Florida has over 2 million septic tanks. Any built before 1983 can be within 6 inches of the water table. (They added stricter regulations in 83, but older systems were grandfathered in and many pre-1983 septics are still in use today. [source from Indian River County. ](http://www.ircutilities.com/S2S/Presentation.pdf) \n\nSo we are literally pooping into the water. How do we know? One way is Sucralose, lose, an artificial sweetener that cannot be broken down by the body or any treatment process for that matter. [source](http://www.fau.edu/newsdesk/articles/septic-system-study.php). It is an ingredient in diet sodas and the like. No way that could be in the water unless someone is dumping Diet Coke or the septic tanks are a leaking. \n\nThat doesn\u2019t even take into account into the bacterial like enteric bacteria which is found in waste. This caused the closure of beaches this year and last year here... And they only test three spots in the whole county... once a week. [Source. ](https://www.tcpalm.com/story/news/local/indian-river-lagoon/health/2019/08/16/bacteria-warning-indian-river-lagoon-sebastian-inlet-state-park/2028210001/)\n\nNot really great for our tourism.  \n\nAt this point I try to stay away from the water personally because of the various health threats. A guy was killed here a few years ago from a flesh eating bacteria that he got from fishing. Others have also died. [source. ](https://www.tcpalm.com/story/news/local/indian-river-lagoon/health/2017/01/06/vibrio-vulnificus-indian-river-lagoon-bacteria/96166924/)\n\nBut I wish septics were the only problem. They are not. Other issues are fertilizers which are basically nitrogen. So add them to your non-native yard, it rains like it does in tropical Florida and it washes a bunch of nitrogen and phosphorus into our waterways, furthering the blooms and bad things in the water. Thankfully many cities and counties around here have banned application of fertilizer in the summer rainy season. But golf courses and Ag are exempted. And of course they are some of the biggest polluters. Add in that many local big box stores don\u2019t care about local regulations and thus they still sell fertilizer even when it is illegal to apply it. [source. ](http://ircstormwater.com/fertilizer.htm)\n\nYet another contributor is stormwater runoff. As you probably know, Florida is pretty flat. It used to be a swamp for the most part. I live in what was once part of Mosquito County [(old map) ](https://www.floridamemory.com/blog/2018/12/21/a-county-called-mosquito/)because they had a lot of swampy standing water. In the middle of the 20th Century, as people were discovering how lovely the weather is in Florida, the state and local municipalities undertook one of the most ambitious engineering projects of the time, draining the swamps and straightening the rivers and making more land for people and farms. These canals still exist today and are maintained rigorously to avoid flooding. This basically flushes all the rain water to our lagoon and oceans. Untreated. So we also get septic pollution washing out from houses away from the waterways and also trash and plant waste (branches, grass clippings, etc.) in our waters. Some parking lots drain directly to the lagoon or ocean with no treatment. There are several stormwater parks in our area which treat the water in a natural way, as it passes through. Nature set itself up to clean out a certain amount of nitrogen from water as it goes by, trees use it (like our beautiful Mangroves) but there is too much now. [Source, but I said a lot here and it may not all be covered here. ](http://ircstormwater.com/)\n\nThis does not take into account the damage the freshwater does to the Indian River Lagoon, which is brackish (a mix of fresh and salt water) and messes with the ecosystems in the water. \n\nA further complication is \u201csewage sludge.\u201d The right wing PC word for this is Biosolids. Biosolids are the de-watered sewage by-product of wastewater (sewage) treatment plants. Despite the name, biosolids are predominantly water, typically containing only 20% solids. Because they are biologically active, nutrient-rich, and contain chemical compounds as well as toxic metals, disposal of biosolids onto open land is a major threat to our waters. Land application of these were banned in South Florida, so they moved up north and farmers were applying \u201cfree\u201d fertilizer to their farms with sewage sludge from south Florida. My county has put a 6 month moratorium on these, but can not ban them completely due to state law. This led to a terrible bloom in Blue Cypress Lake last year. [source](https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-blue-cypress-lake-tragedy-20180720-story.html)\n\nSo back to money, just replacing all the septics in my county (all 30k of them) would cost the taxpayers an estimated $500 Million. I can not find a source for this but I heard the number from the IRC Director of Utilities at a meeting last week. One of the previous links provided the way they are doing it now, by fixing the biggest problems first, and could be done in a few hundred years at their current rate. \n\nAnother way money is a big problem is that special interests buy a lot of influence. And the state legislature is doing pretty much nothing to stop it. [example. ](https://www.miamiherald.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/carl-hiaasen/article236586568.html) [another example. ](https://www.tampabay.com/news/environment/2019/10/24/new-florida-wildlife-corridor-expedition-aims-to-show-what-new-toll-roads-would-destroy/)\n\nA few years ago there was a big victory for environmental groups, we had a citizen amendment called Florida Water and Land Conservation Initiative, Amendment 1 (2014). [Amendment info.](https://ballotpedia.org/Florida_Water_and_Land_Conservation_Initiative,_Amendment_1_(2014)). The legislature did not like this and did not abide with (at least) the spirit of the law. [source. ](https://news.wjct.org/post/court-backs-florida-lawmakers-conservation-fight) The money was supposed to buy and conserve land but has been used for other purposes. My favorite was to pay FDEP Tech Support salaries. Basically they took the money And used it for things that weren\u2019t proper uses so they could get away without cutting other programs or raising taxes. \n\nAll of this said, this may be more than you asked for but it really pisses me off how pretty little people care about their water. Water is everything, and giving crops or livestock polluted water can cause them to also be polluted. [source. ](https://www.onegreenplanet.org/environment/shocking-facts-on-how-factory-farms-cause-water-pollution/)\n\nAnd I didn\u2019t even get into things like [Glyphosate (Round Up)](https://usrtk.org/pesticides/glyphosate-health-concerns/) or when [there are sewer spills into the water. ](http://veronews.com/2018/07/26/city-aerating-bethel-creek-part-cleanup-effort-sewage-spill/)\n\nBasically we\u2019re a mess down here. Send help. But in all seriousness, I do have hope that this year the legislature will do *something*. It\u2019s an election year after all but we need a lot of help and Gov. DeSantis\u2019 proposed legislation does not go far enough, imo. \n\nSorry for any typos. Am in an app on my phone. Hope this helped. There\u2019s so much more going on, but I fear we are on the brink of ecosystem crash here.",

        "With the exception of the London-Hamilton railroad, the roads are all stagecoach roads.  It took one full week to travel between Montreal and Toronto [on the mail stagecoach](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/stagecoach#) (basically a big coach with mail bags underneath and two rows of 8 benches which would hold 8-16 people).   \n\nThat leg of the stagecoach road was known as the king\u2019s road, later to become Ontario provincial Highway 2, and then dissolved when the 401 was built to the north of it (it very much served the same purpose in this part of Canada as what the historic [\u201cNational road\u201d](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Road) served in the US).  In Canada, beyond Ontario, it extended into the (French) King\u2019s road, which is [North America\u2019s oldest long-distance inter-city road](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemin_du_Roy).\n\nPRIOR to these stagecoach roads (only 30-40 yrs prior), if a person wanted to travel from Montreal (Canada\u2019s main city at the time), to say Midland or the area around Point Edward (later Sarnia), a person who have to go by boat northwest on the Ottawa River, and then take the French River (bisected by lake Nippissing), into Lake Huron, and then south by boat.  This is why the French River is so prominent on this map.  A person could not go down the St. Laurence because of rapids and eventually Niagara Falls.\n\nThe Niagara water route only became feasible once the Welland Canal was built.  But the canal in the early 1800s took a different route than today\u2019s Canada.  You can see it as a bold black line across the Niagara Peninsula.\n\nThe original canal is now a unusable weed-grown large ditch with stagnant water which still runs through farmland.  [Today you can still drive along it for about 40 minutes through farmland around Wainfleet](https://www.trekearth.com/gallery/North_America/Canada/Central/Ontario/Wainfleet/photo153896.htm) and see all the original brick and stone buildings from its glory days of the early 1800s (It started roughly where it currently starts, but diverged at Welland away from the modern canal, went through Wainfleet, then entered Lake Erie at what was known as Sherbrooke, ON and Grande River, ON, now known as Port Dalhousie).\n\nPrince Edward County (the jut of jagged land on Lake Ontario\u2019s north coast half way up the lake) has so many roads on it in the 1830s because this is where most of the many tens of thousands of British Empire loyalists entered into Canada from the US after 1793, subsequent to the US was of independence.   Today this area (and the inland counties around it) is still known as \u201cloyalist country\u201d, with its own accent, some say it\u2019s own genetic makeup, and even its own architecture which is more similar to New England than the rest of Ontario (as can be seen in the towns of [Wellington and Picton for example](http://prince-edward-county.com/wp-content/uploads/wellington-main-2.jpg)).  \n\nIn the 150 years following the settlement of Prince Edward county, the loyalists branched out across the rest of Ontario, intermarried with non-loyalists, but had the effect of standardizing the Ontarian English accent (from a precious mish-mash of accents).  The Ontarian standard accent was then brought to Western Canada in the late 1800s/early 1900s, which is why Canada (from west of Prince Edward County) generally has little variation in its English accent all the way to the Pacific Coast (although PE county and surrounding did retain a slight variation of its own accent owing to entrenched families since 1793... Example, \u201cmalk\u201d instead of \u201cmilk\u201d.  And over the last 150 years, there has been time for some parts of Western Canada to diverge a little in terms of accent, moreso in Alberta and Saskatchewan owing to a more varied mix of settlement waves).  Go east of PE county, and the Canadian English accents begin to diverge owing to less influence from the loyalists (the Ottawa valley accent for example, or various Atlantic Province accents).  It\u2019s noteworthy though that southern Quebec English accents are similar to the PE county accent because of loyalists who streamed into Quebec\u2019s Eastern Townships (albeit in smaller numbers).",

        "\nWar of 1812\n\n\nThe\u00a0War of 1812\u00a0was a conflict fought between the United States and the United Kingdom, with their respective allies, from June 1812 to February 1815. Historians in Britain often see it as a minor theatre of the\u00a0Napoleonic Wars; historians in the United States and Canada see it as a war in its own right.\n\nWar of 1812Part of the\u00a0Napoleonic Wars\ufffc\nClockwise from top: damage to the\u00a0United States Capitol\u00a0after the\u00a0Burning of Washington; mortally wounded\u00a0Isaac Brock\u00a0spurs on the\u00a0York Volunteers\u00a0at the\u00a0battle of Queenston Heights;\u00a0USS\u00a0Constitution\u00a0vs HMS\u00a0Guerriere;\u00a0The death of\u00a0Tecumseh\u00a0in 1813;\u00a0Andrew Jackson\u00a0defeats the\u00a0British assault\u00a0on\u00a0New Orleans\u00a0in 1815DateJune 18, 1812\u00a0\u2013 February 17, 1815\n(2\u00a0years and 8\u00a0months)Location\n\nEastern and Central America; Atlantic and Pacific Oceans\n\nResultTreaty of Ghent\n\nMilitary stalemate\n\nStatus quo ante bellum\n\nDefeat of\u00a0Tecumseh's Confederacy\n\nBelligerents\ufffc\u00a0United States\n\nChoctaw\n\nCherokee\n\nCreek\n\nSeneca\n\n\ufffc\u00a0United Kingdom\n\n\ufffc\u00a0The Canadas\n\nTecumseh's Confederacy[a]\n\nShawnee\n\nCreek\u00a0Red Sticks\n\nOjibwe\n\nFox\n\nIroquois\n\nMiami\n\nMingo\n\nOttawa\n\nKickapoo\n\nDelaware (Lenape)\n\nMascouten\n\nPotawatomi\n\nSauk\n\nWyandot\n\n\ufffc\u00a0Kingdom of Spain\n\n\ufffc\u00a0Florida\u00a0(1814)\n\nCommanders and leaders\n\n\ufffc\u00a0James Madison\n\n\ufffc\u00a0Henry Dearborn\n\n\ufffc\u00a0Jacob Brown\n\n\ufffc\u00a0Winfield Scott\n\n\ufffc\u00a0Andrew Jackson\n\n\ufffc\u00a0William Henry Harrison\n\n\ufffc\u00a0William H.

To man the blockade, Britain\u00a0pressed\u00a0American merchant sailors into the Royal Navy. American sentiment grew increasingly hostile toward Britain due to incidents such as the\u00a0Chesapeake\u2013Leopard\u00a0affair, which happened five years before the war. The British were in turn outraged by the\u00a0Little Belt\u00a0affair\u00a0in 1811, in which 11 British sailors died.[9][10]\u00a0Britain supplied arms to American Indians who raided American settlers on the frontier, hindering American expansion and provoking resentment.[11]\u00a0Historians debate whether the desire to annex some or all of\u00a0British North America\u00a0(Canada) contributed to the American decision to go to war. However, the Western interest was in expansion into American territories such as Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin, where they were threatened by Indians supported by the British. On June 18, 1812, President\u00a0James Madison\u00a0signed into law the American declaration of war, after heavy pressure from the War Hawks in Congress.[12]\n\nWith most of its army in Europe fighting\u00a0Napoleon, Britain adopted a defensive strategy, with offensive operations initially limited to the border and the western frontier. American prosecution of the war effort suffered from\u00a0its unpopularity, especially in New England, where it was referred to as \"Mr. Madison's War\". American defeats at the\u00a0Siege of Detroit\u00a0and the\u00a0Battle of Queenston Heights\u00a0thwarted attempts to seize\u00a0Upper Canada, improving British morale. American attempts also failed to invade\u00a0Lower Canada\u00a0and capture\u00a0Montreal. In 1813, the Americans won the\u00a0Battle of Lake Erie, gaining control of the lake, and they defeated\u00a0Tecumseh's Confederacy\u00a0at the\u00a0Battle of the Thames, securing a primary war goal. The Americans made a final attempt to invade Canada but fought to a draw at the\u00a0Battle of Lundy's Lane\u00a0during the summer of 1814. At sea, the powerful Royal Navy blockaded American ports, cutting off trade and allowing the British to raid the coast at will. In 1814, one of these raids\u00a0burned the capital, but the Americans later repulsed British attempts to\u00a0invade New York\u00a0and\u00a0Maryland, ending invasions from Canada into the northern and mid-Atlantic states. In early 1815, the Americans\u00a0decisively defeated\u00a0the invading British Army attacking New Orleans, Louisiana. Fighting also took place in\u00a0Spanish Florida; a\u00a0two-day battle\u00a0for the city of Pensacola ended in Spanish surrender.[13]\n\nIn Britain, there was mounting opposition to wartime taxation, and merchants demanded to reopen trade with America. With the\u00a0abdication of Napoleon, Britain's war ended with France and Britain ceased impressment, rendering the issue irrelevant of the impressment of American sailors. The British were then able to increase the strength of the blockade on the United States coast, smothering American maritime trade, but their attempts failed to invade America, at which point both sides began to desire peace.[14]\n\nPeace negotiations began in August 1814, and the\u00a0Treaty of Ghent\u00a0was signed on December 24, 1814. News of the peace did not reach America for some time. In February 1815, news reached the East Coast concerning the great victory at New Orleans\u2014at the same time as news of the Christmas peace treaty. The Americans triumphantly celebrated the restoration of their national honour, leading to the collapse of anti-war sentiment and the beginning of the\u00a0Era of Good Feelings, a period of national unity. The treaty was unanimously ratified by the US Senate on February 17, 1815, ending the war with no boundary changes.[15]\n\nOrigin\n\nForces\n\nDeclaration of war\n\nCourse of war\n\nTreaty of Ghent\n\nLosses and compensation\n\nLong-term consequences\n\nMemory and historiography\n\nSee also\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \n\n\n_*Because nobody read this: what year did the americans win new orleans*_\n\n_*Yeah thats right bitch*_\n\n_*Now lets talk miscarriage*_",

        "The tech pond (41\u00b022'55\"N 83\u00b038'14\"W) is a very shallow pond in the exposed bedrock, near the technology building. You can see glacial striations from the NE to the SW on the East / SE side of the pond, which is pretty much the only side you can walk up to. They'll be feint, parallel lines that cover the entire bedrock. Example:  [https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ClF-JOvVYAAhF6i.jpg](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ClF-JOvVYAAhF6i.jpg)\n\nHere ( [https://geosurvey.ohiodnr.gov/portals/geosurvey/pdfs/glacial/glacial.pdf](https://geosurvey.ohiodnr.gov/portals/geosurvey/pdfs/glacial/glacial.pdf) ) is a map of glacial deposits left behind from the previous three, large scale glaciation periods. The Wisconsinan (14,000 - 24,000 years old) is the most recent ice age and left behind that light blue color \"Wave-planed ground moraine\".\n\nWave-planed is just another way to say it was effected by a large-scale lake, such as Glacial Lake Warren (I'll talk about glacial lakes in a minute). Moraine deposits are actually pretty cool. Essentially, as the Laurentide ice sheet traveled southward from its accumulation point in northern Canada, it was constantly picking up everything it ran into and eroded. When the glacier started to melt and retreat, everything caught up in it, giant boulders to pebbles, are dropped where they're melted from and left behind.\n\nNow if you look where BG is on a map in Wood County, you'll notice that we are pretty much right on the edge of those older lake deposits. The way you describe your soil being, \"primarily clay\", sounds exactly like the author of that map, \"Many glacial lakes were formed in Ohio during the Ice Age. Lake deposits are primarily fine-grained clay- and silt-size sediments.\". So I'd say chances are, your deposits are some kind of remnants from the glacial lakes for sure, which is why this area is such great for farming. The glacial lakes essentially gave way to the Great Black Swamp after all.  The sand deposits are definitely ancient shore-lines to those lakes though. If not the exact shoreline, sand from those shorelines that got transported through wind or a stream to nearby.\n\nNow I'm not sure, since i'd have to see them to tell, but most likely what these \"Swamp Rocks\" are, are the moraine deposits that were left behind. As you drive across our beautiful corn and soybean country side, you'll notice that on the edge of farmers fields there are always large piles of rocks. These are boulders, cobbles, and pebbles left behind from the ice sheet. What's cool is that a lot of northern Canada, where the ice sheet originates, contain some of the worlds oldest aged volcanic and metamorphic deposits. These deposits, in the Canadian Shield, can be up to 4.3 billion years old  [http://geology.teacherfriendlyguide.org/index.php/geohist-mw/geohist-canadian-mw](http://geology.teacherfriendlyguide.org/index.php/geohist-mw/geohist-canadian-mw) , which is almost the age of the earth (4.6 billion). So, a lot of people find these volcanic rocks and think that there most of been volcanoes around Ohio, when in fact they came from up North.\n\nFor the glacial lakes in Northern Ohio, and all around the great lakes, they were massive. This  [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/Glacial\\_Lake\\_beaches\\_of\\_the\\_Lake\\_Erie\\_Basin.JPG](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/Glacial_Lake_beaches_of_the_Lake_Erie_Basin.JPG)  is an older figure, but shows the falling and rising of the previous lakes in the Lake Erie Basin. You can see that current Lake Erie is \\~575 ft above sea level. Previous lakes including; Warren, Whittlesey, and the Maumee where 680, 735, and 812 ft respectively, above sea level!  Here's a map, that I don't really like, that shows a rough extent of the lakes  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake\\_Maumee#/media/File:Glacial\\_lakes.jpg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Maumee#/media/File:Glacial_lakes.jpg)  .\n\nHope this all was informative! I think think it's sweet!\n\nEDIT: \n\nI went and used this tool  [https://websoilsurvey.sc.egov.usda.gov/App/WebSoilSurvey.aspx](https://websoilsurvey.sc.egov.usda.gov/App/WebSoilSurvey.aspx)  to create a soil map of the area about 2-4 miles west of Bowling Green. Here, [https://ibb.co/tHdyJPN](https://ibb.co/tHdyJPN) is the map of the area I selected, maybe your parents place is in there. \n\nThe main three components are the; Hoytville clay loam (29.3%), Mermill-Aurand complex (23.5%), and the Ottokee-Spinks loamy fine sands 19.3%. The rest being minor components. The description of each is at the end. The most interesting portion that I read is this, about the Ottokee-Spinks loamy fine sands; \"*Landform:* Dunes on lake plains, beach ridges on lake plains, knolls on lake plains, *Landform position (two-dimensional):* Summit, shoulder, backslope, *Parent material:* Eolian sands over sandy glaciolacustrine deposits\"\n\nSo it seams that the sand deposits parent material (where they came from) were wind blown (eolian) dunes from lake shore deposits. Pretty interesting.\n\nTry and use the web soil survey tool yourself and highlight exactly your parents property if you want to know the exact % of each soil group. Also, you can see the extent to which the sand body moves and in which direction. Super cool.

        "Wichita State offers Harambe Card (14)\n\nScholarship\n\nSchool Visit\n\nCoach Visit\n\nLorain, Ohio to Wichita, Kansas is a 14 hour drive. Now, most recruits would walk away after hearing that. But you\u2019re a bit different. You don\u2019t care about how close or far your college of choice is going to be. The thing you care about most is the atmosphere, the feel of your college of choice. And I get that. You grew up in a blue collar town, right on the banks of Lake Erie. Lorain isn\u2019t a small city, but it isn\u2019t big either, its a comfy, cozy just right. Now you may be getting calls from Coach Natro over at Cincinnati University, and while Cincy may be a lot closer, it\u2019s also a lot bigger. In fact, the Cincinnati Metro Area is home to over 2 million people! Now compare that to the much more homely Wichita Metro Area, which is home to about a quarter of Cincinnati\u2019s.\n\nNow I was doing a little bit of research on Lorain after seeing your film, and the similarities between your hometown, and the home of the Shockers, uhhhh, shocked me. Pun intended. Now the main reason for both of the cities existing is simple - they\u2019re on the banks of a major water source. Lake Erie for Lorain, and the Arkansas River for Wichita. And, that\u2019s not the only similarity. Both cities started off as manufacturing towns, and to a degree, both still are today. Lorain was home to one of Henry Ford\u2019s first manufacturing plants, while Wichita was the birthplace of Cessna. Now one more thing that struck me while I was researching, is the Parks and Rec Department of Lorain\u2019s government. It\u2019s a fantastic thing to be within a few blocks of a park, no matter where you are in the city. I\u2019m sure many of your fondest memories have to be playing pickup in these parks. That\u2019s where I fostered my love of the game, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s the same for you. That\u2019s something that you can continue here at Wichita State, as the city of Wichita maintains over 100 parks in city limits, several of them within a few blocks of the university.\n\nNow while we\u2019re on the subject of playing ball, let\u2019s talk a little bit about what your role on the team will be. You might have looked at our roster and noticed that we already have several guards on the team playing big minutes. You don\u2019t need to worry about your playing time, as we don\u2019t have a single player with your skillset on our team. And I see you as the missing puzzle piece for us. We already have the athletic 2 guard (Jay Johnson), the freakishly athletic wing (Chad Webb), the solid all-around big man (Kevin Loose), and the off-ball sniper (Corey Sutton). Now all we need is the stud ball handler for a complete offensive unit. You\u2019re going to be the primary ball handler here for us, as your handles, and distributing skills are pretty much unmatched in your class. Now Coach Natro might say that you're going to play 30 minutes a night at Cincinnati, but you should know that doesn't mean anything. You're the #14 recruit in the country. You're going to get 30 minutes a game anywhere! What really matters to a player of your caliber is the system you're going to be playing in. I have always played a four-out one-in style of offense, with a platoon of guards and forwards playing around the perimeter with one traditional big on the inside. This means that we can use every player\u2019s skills to their fullest extent. Athletic wings can cut inside while catching feeds from the passers (you) and spot up snipers can find their hot spots outside of the arc while their defenders get drawn away helping on pick and rolls, and the cutters I just mentioned. Your role in this fluid offense is simple. You\u2019ll be able to diagnose the defense, and put the ball where it needs to go. You might run a pick and roll, and drop a pocket pass to the roll man. You might drive off of a dribble handoff and dish back to the wide open shooter. You might just throw lobs to the high-flyers inside. You can do all of it. But while you do have a full toolbox on offense, what really stood out to me when I was watching your film was your defensive skills.\n\nYou love to play defense, and I love that. In my first four years here at Wichita State, we played a 1-2-2 full court press on defense. We could do this because our entire team was quick and athletic, and, perhaps most importantly, well conditioned. Now the role of the \u201c1\u201d in the 1-2-2 is the most important. The second the offense inbounds the ball, they must hound them, forcing them to go either left or right. This is why coaches always put their longest, quickest defender at the top. Once the ball handler picks a side, the defender on that side (typically another guard) flies in from half court and traps the ball handler. The defender on the opposite side is responsible for the inbounder, and looks to intercept any pass out of the trap. Now, I haven\u2019t been able to run this defense in recent years because we didn\u2019t have a guard who was quick enough and long enough to play at the top of the defense.\n\nI can tell that you\u2019re a student of the game from how quickly you\u2019re soaking all of this up. But as a student athlete, that\u2019s only half the battle. You also need to be a student in the classroom. I know this isn\u2019t a huge priority for you. You\u2019re a five star recruit, #14 in the country. You aren\u2019t here to play school. Our job as a coaching staff is to make sure you stay on track in the classroom, while staying ahead of the curve on the court. That\u2019s why we just finished construction of our multi-million dollar Student Athlete Success Center. This center is built with the massive needs of our student-athletes in mind. It features a 2,500 sqft study hall as well as several areas for private tutoring. Now ball might be life, but you need to stay up to date in class, and this facility makes sure Wichita State is ahead of the curve when it comes to supporting the double life that student-athletes live. Now, this center is my baby. I\u2019ve been working on getting it built for years now, pulling strings, calling in favors, doing whatever I needed to.\n\nNow, it takes a good while to build up that kind of influence, and I think I\u2019m there. Eight years with the Shockers, and next year will be nine. Over that time my staff and I have built up quite a reputation as one of the most trustworthy in the business. Our loyalty rating is an excellent 87, a whole 15 points above the national average. We got this far by keeping the promises we make to our players. If we say we\u2019re going to do something, we do it, no matter what. During my very first time on the recruiting trail for the Shockers, I told recruits that I would be here in Wichita until I had brought us back to relevance. I\u2019ve signed two new contracts since then, and each time I\u2019ve been asked to take different jobs, in different conferences, in different parts of the country. And each time when I had to make a decision, I thought back to the promises I made way back in the 2030s, and as a result, I signed a new contract with the Shockers.\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk a little bit about the sweetest part of basketball - winning. While Wichita State has historically not been a great program, they\u2019ve been on the upswing under my watch. I\u2019ve brought the Shockers more winning seasons in eight years than in the 20 years before I arrived. And, while last season didn\u2019t go according to plan, it meant that our fantastic young core got plenty of experience, and, even better, they all came back. This means that you\u2019ll be joining a team that\u2019s young, hungry, and in a prime spot to shock the world.\n\nLet\u2019s do it.",

        "&gt;ERIE, Pa. \u2014 T.J. Abraham is a block of a man with a tree-trunk neck and a lantern jaw. He played football at a top Catholic high school outside Pittsburgh and then traveled downtown to Duquesne University, where he played another three years.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;He was an offensive lineman back then, and he gloried in the fraternity of hit and get hit, joyfully clanking helmets. Sometime he saw stars, sometimes he puked and so what? Get back up and get back in. \u201cI probably got my bell rung 70 times,\u201d he said Sunday with a crooked smile.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;He always knew he would get on with life. He was a top student, and in time he became an obstetrics &amp; gynecology doctor, delivering so many babies, maybe 3,000, a gregarious guy who remembered birthdays and who could make a nervous expectant mother grin. He had a beautiful home and a wife and a young daughter and a teenage son. He was a son of western Pennsylvania and life was grand.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;He shakes his head: Until it wasn\u2019t.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It was about seven years ago that the now 42-year-old Abraham said he began to notice his temper flaring without reason. His memory and judgment became flickering lamps. In a panic, he began a medical trek that ended with an inconceivable diagnosis: neurodegenerative dementia.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cWhen you hear the words \u2018no cure\u2019 and \u2018you\u2019re only going to get worse,\u2019 well, that is tough,\u201d Abraham said. \u201cThere is no light at the end of the tunnel. This was not supposed to be my life.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;As to the cause?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The brain is a terrifically complex instrument, and its misfires are not like diagnosing a busted carburetor. But doctors in Boston, Philadelphia and California agreed that all signs pointed to football as the root of Abraham\u2019s cognitive issues, and they raised the strong possibility that one day his survivors will learn that he had chronic traumatic encephalopathy, the degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head, the one found \u2014 almost always posthumously \u2014 in the brains of so many football players.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Abraham is intent on coming to terms with his new reality. On Tuesday, he will testify at a New York State Assembly hearing on a proposed bill to ban tackle football for children age 12 and younger. He loved football, played and coached it, and the sport gave him so much joy. And he sees his testimony as driven by moral necessity.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cI do not want see anyone lose what I\u2019ve lost or experience this disease,\u201d he has written in his testimony, which he labored on for days, fearful words might fail him. \u201cI strongly urge you to ban tackle football at the age of 12 and younger in the state of New York.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Abraham spoke of his life journey on Sunday. I met him at his handsome home amid stands of oaks and the vineyards of Harborcreek, Pa., and we drove to Erie and sat in his S.U.V. outside UPMC Magee-Womens Hospital, which sits on a bluff overlooking the gray-white chop of Lake Erie. This was Abraham\u2019s professional home. He worked 100-hour weeks here, loving the challenge, the camaraderie, the purity of each birth. When he resigned in 2018, his partners, women and men, put their heads on his big shoulders and sobbed.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;He felt himself in a bad dream, and that he had no choice.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;He had for several years tried to ignore the gathering clouds in his brain. He learned to fill his daily phone calendar to overflowing, dozens upon dozens of reminders. He forgot the names of patients and nurses. He misplaced his pager and lost his hospital badge. He attributed this to the wages of too many hours and stresses. He downloaded apps so that he\u2019d know which antibiotics to prescribe, which birth control pills to recommend. Some days, by evening, he grew scared and he would think to himself: Tomorrow I\u2019ve got to see someone about this.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;He would forget that by the time he awoke.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cI had been lying to the nurses and tell them I had to pee so that I could go and look up how to finish a surgery,\u201d he said. \u201cFinally I said enough. No more.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;To talk of his present is to wind back to his past, and to football. His memory is of hit upon hit upon hit, that was life on an offensive line. His experience is consistent with the direction of much of the new research. Football\u2019s threat to the brain now is less about concussions, those most catastrophic of head collisions, than repeated hits, the sheer repetitive smacking around of the brain inside the skull. Boston University\u2019s C.T.E. center has estimated that the average college football player experiences 800-1,000 hits in a single season.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The rituals of practice pour fuel on the fires of aggression. Abraham recalled bull in the ring, that most primal of football drills. The players would form a circle and a player would step into the middle, shuffling feet, eyes darting, as player after player hurtled at the \u201cbull,\u201d smacking pads, cracking helmets. Sometimes Abraham would fall to the ground, his head spinning.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The training grew tougher in college. Abraham was no small fellow, 6-foot-1 and 260 pounds, and for his size quick as a panther. But at Duquesne, for the first time, he found himself facing bigger, stouter, faster players, and coaches who demanded freshmen prove themselves by facing off against the junior and senior starters. \u201cThey wanted to see who was not afraid to hit and get hit,\u201d he said. \u201cMan, there were guys with biceps the size of my head.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;As they clanked and whacked, he said, the coaches yelled: \u201cDon\u2019t be a sissy, hit him!\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This is not to suggest Duquesne was particularly brutal. These are simply the wages of major college football.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Some days now, Abraham feels as if he is surrounded by shards of his life. He remembers but not really. He comprehends but not completely. \u201cI remember nothing about the birth of my daughter,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember nothing about my wedding. To know that I said things to hurt people, it\u2019s like when you get drunk and you wake up and 'what the hell?\u2019\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;For all the medical evidence pointing in the direction of C.T.E., though, he cannot state with certainty that he has it. There\u2019s that crooked smile of his again. \u201cThey can only determine that after my death.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;For now, he is intent on spending as much time as possible with his children.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cMy daughter asks me: \u2018Daddy, is your brain getting better?\u2019\u201d Abraham said. \u201cAnd my heart breaks because I know the answer is no.\u201d",

        "&gt; Would you call this a correlation?\n\nDunno. You should call CARB and find out.\n\n&gt; Do you stand by your statement: \"California's CO2/kWh has dropped by half due to renewables.\"?\n\nEIA's statement, not mine. So until you get details from CARB saying otherwise, sure, why wouldn't I?\n\n&gt; Again, you reverting to ad hominem (ad countrynem?)\n\nThat's not an ad hominem.\n\n&gt;  by focusing on France\n\nTracing back through the thread, the term \"France\" was introduced by you, and has been posted in every single one of your posts since then that I can see. You state we should use France as the benchmark, for no cogent reason, and continue to dismiss anyone that has a higher number as a failure, or lower because that doesn't count.\n\nSeriously, why *are* you so focussed on France?\n\n&gt; Would you call focusing on the three last datapoint \"cherry picking\"?\n\nI'm including the first point to the last, and every point in the middle. No cherry picking there.\n\nCompared to, say, the statement you made yesterday where you freely admitted to picking only numbers in the middle of the chart.\n\n&gt; The IEA data prove my point about the level of speed of france CO2/kWh reduction, why does it need to go beyond 2008?\n\nTo see if anyone else has had similar rate since then.\n\nBut actually you're right, we don't have to. That's because even that graph shows Denmark lowered its CO2/kWh more rapidly than France.\n\n&gt; (You're grasping at straws of any strawman you can)\n\nNow that *is* an ad hominem. Make sure you understand the difference.\n\n&gt; Should I ask you to show me data from solar and wind from the 60s?\n\nSure, what would you like to know? The first grid-tie PV system didn't happen until May 1982 though, so the 60s is a bit of a stretch. But you can [read about it here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330315206_35_years_of_photovoltaics_Analysis_of_the_TISO-10-kW_solar_plant_lessons_learnt_in_safety_and_performance-Part_1). Wind is older, and I'd be happy to provide some sources if you like.\n\n&gt; I have seen a technology acheive about 50gCO2/kWh\n\nAnd I've seen one reach one less than 10 in multiple places around the world, flat and mountainous, rich and poor, heavily populated and sparsely.\n\nBut that doesn't count. Because water.\n\n&gt; \"a population of 1.4 million\", \"largely unpopulated\"; costa rica is 5 million\n\nRight.  So a rich, highly populated state can do it on their flat land (the Hudson Bay Lowlands to be exact), a rich sparsely populated state can do it (Canadian Shield), a rich densely populated mountainous state can do it (the Alps) and a poor lightly populated state can do it.\n\nBut you say it can't be done. Sure, makes total sense.\n\n&gt; I assume you're having as ardent conversations on everyone suggesting solar and wind then.\n\nIf it's cheaper and better, absolutely!\n\nFor instance, right here in Ontario we were able to greatly expand hydro production at Niagara Falls by [boring new tunnels to carry water from Lake Erie to the power head upstream of the falls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niagara_Tunnel_Project). Cost practically nothing to do, went in fast, and down went our CO2. If someone said we should have spent that on PV instead, I'd definitely have called them nuts, and that was when I was actually in the PV industry.\n\nAnd beyond that, I have repeatedly stated in public and in letters to my MPP and the Minister of Energy and Infrastructure that we should not build more PV while Quebec is still offering their hydro at super-cheap rates which we can buy for less than developing our own generation. Buying power from Quebec is an absolute no-brainer, yet our provincial government insists on building wind turbines instead because they *absolutely* can't imagine paying a single cent more to Quebec no matter how good it would be to do so. And so New York, which has no previous history in that regard, is building a monster freaking cable right down the middle of Lake Champlain to carry a GW of power all the way from Montreal to Queens, a distance of over 600 km *not* including the 450 km from Montreal to La Grande.\n\nYou're the one pushing the one-size-fits-all solution. I say pick the best solution for the problem, and that's going to be a different solution for different problems.\n\n&gt; After all, hydro is the best of both worlds, not only is it demontrately cheap (your favorite feature) but also has demontrated low CO2/kWh (my favourite feature). How silly anyone should to want solar and wind? If they can figure it out, why can't everybody?\n\nYou're the one pushing something that's more expensive, slower and and has higher CO2. You tell me.\n\n&gt; So you would support a cheap nuclear that hasn't reach the same level of CO2/kWh than an expensive hydo\n\nIf hydro is cheaper than nuclear, *which it is*, and reduces CO2 more than nuclear, *which it does*, are you saying you **wouldn't** support it?\n\n&gt; But then, how bod should climate change get before you consider that it is time to give up on \"wait and see\"?\n\nWe're installing clean power faster than any time in history and you're saying we should give up.\n\n&gt; It it were, Denmark would be the best candidate to demontrate it, but they apparently chose to satisfy themselves with 100gCO2/kWh.\n\nYou're the only one picking 50, and I have no idea why. Can you show me *why* 50 is the correct number? Why not 100? Or 10? What is magical about 50 other than that's the number where you happen to live? The number here in Ontario is 25, so why shouldn't we use that number?\n\n&gt; I'm getting old enough to favour the good enough of the past, albeit expensive, to the maybe better of the future, even if cheap.\n\nSo I assume you're typing this on a Commodore 64?\n\n&gt; I'm beginning to suspect that you are purely trolling and making fun of me.\n\nRiiiight. So you...\n* keep talking about France and then saying I'm focussing on it\n* post sources that are either out of date or don't say what you claim\n* when I post up-to-date results you post pure speculation on why they don't agree with you\n* repeatedly claim that hydro isn't renewable \"just because\"\n* say not everyone can do it in a country that's Europe's 3rd largest hydro source\n* fail to answer any of the issues surrounding the absolute failure of nuclear to address CO2 *today*\n\nBut fine, I'm the troll, go with that..",

        "ROCHESTER, N.Y. \u2014 With much of the election energy focused on next year\u2019s presidential election, most of the contests in New York State have stuck firmly to the all-the-politics-is-local playbook, hinging on issues like schools and crime.\n\nBut one district attorney race on the banks of Lake Ontario has become an unlikely big-money referendum on traditional law-and-order prosecutors, much like similar battles in Boston, Philadelphia and Queens, N.Y.\n\nThe race in Monroe County pits a Republican incumbent, Sandra Doorley, against an insurgent challenger, Shani Curry Mitchell, a progressive newcomer who has drawn the attention and backing from the billionaire George Soros.\n\nSince early October, Mr. Soros has spent more than $800,000 on ads supporting Ms. Mitchell through one of his political action committees, helping to bring visibility to a candidate pledging to stop \u201cthe overprosecution of the poor\u201d and minority groups, and restore trust between law enforcement and communities in the county.\n\nSign up for the New York Today Newsletter\nEach morning, get the latest on New York businesses, arts, sports, dining, style and more.\n\nSIGN UP\nThe outside spending benefiting Ms. Mitchell, who is running on the Democratic and Working Families Party lines, has drawn a fiery rebuke from Republicans and Ms. Doorley, who accused Mr. Soros of meddling and foul play.\n\n\u201cGeorge Soros doesn\u2019t know a damn thing about me,\u201d Ms. Doorley said. \u201cHis New York PAC doesn\u2019t know a damn thing about me.\u201d\n\nJust to the southwest of Rochester, another campaign \u2014 the only legislative race in New York this November \u2014 is operating on an entirely different economic model, as a 22-year-old, Austin Morgan, is attempting to ride last year\u2019s Democratic momentum to pull off an upset in State Senate District 57.\n\nMr. Morgan, who began his candidacy last winter while still an undergraduate at Cornell University, is running a shoestring campaign: His most recent filing with the State Board of Elections showed he had exactly $3,819.07 on hand.\n\nThat\u2019s enough to pay for gas in the 2012 Ford Escape that he drives around the district, a giant chunk of the state bordered by Pennsylvania and Lake Erie.\n\nEditors\u2019 Picks\n\nInside the Debate Between Netflix and Big Theater Chains Over \u2018The Irishman\u2019\n\nChristie\u2019s Auctioned a $40 Million Diamond. Was It Stolen?\n\n36 Hours in Berlin\nHis campaign manager, Ravo Root, is a high school friend \u2014 \u201cWe were in band together,\u201d Mr. Morgan said \u2014 who is still in college in Potsdam, N.Y., some 300 miles from the district.\n\nThe seat that Mr. Morgan is trying to win is a comfortably conservative one, most recently represented by the former senator Catharine Young, a Republican.\n\nMs. Young stepped down in March after failing to oust the minority leader, Senator John J. Flanagan of Long Island, following the party\u2019s devastating losses in 2018. Those losses flipped Albany\u2019s upper chamber to Democratic control for only the third time in the last 50 years.\n\nBut Republicans are seemingly not taking the seat for granted; the Republican State Senate campaign has spent $90,000 to assist their candidate, George Borrello, something Mr. Morgan sees as a sign of nerves.\n\nIf Mr. Morgan were to win, it would be a resounding upset, and perhaps reflective of how the impeachment-related developments surrounding President Trump have filtered down to local races. That possibility, Republicans say, is exceedingly dim.\n\n\u201cGeorge Borrello is an extraordinary public servant and we are confident he will win resoundingly on Tuesday,\u201d said Scott Reif, a spokesman for the Republican minority in the Senate.\n\nThe race in Monroe County, where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans, may be a closer call. That Democratic advantage is also the case in Ulster County, in the Hudson Valley, where Mr. Soros\u2019s PAC, the New York Justice and Public Safety Political Action Committee, has also put at least $184,000 behind Democrat David Clegg, who is running against Michael J. Kavanagh, a Republican.\n\nIndeed, the races in Monroe and Ulster are among the district attorney races that the Justice and Public Safety PAC has invested in, including support of the Working Families Party during Tiffany Cab\u00e1n\u2019s near miss earlier this year in Queens.\n\nBut that narrow loss did not douse Mr. Soros\u2019s interest in local races; his PAC has contributed to five campaigns this election cycle, up and down the East Coast: In Virginia, the PAC has given $621,144.97 to the commonwealth\u2019s attorney candidate Parisa Dehghani-Tafti, and $462,212.37 to the commonwealth\u2019s attorney candidate Steve Descano. In Pennsylvania, the PAC has given $53,900 for research, polling and campaign literature to Friends of Jack Stollsteimer, another Democrat, in the Delaware County district attorney race.\n\nLike Ms. Cab\u00e1n, Ms. Mitchell has been running on a platform of criminal justice reform and more equitable prosecution, saying that too many low-level, nonviolent offenders are being put in prison in the county. And the money being spent on her behalf, she says, is a testament to that message.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s because someone has dared to come out and run a campaign on change, on a platform that\u2019s about seeking true justice and true safety, and that resonates,\u201d said Ms. Mitchell, who worked under Ms. Doorley as a prosecutor in the Monroe office for several years. She added: \u201cI had the guts to do it.\u201d\n\nMr. Morgan\u2019s pitch is decidedly more pragmatic, telling voters that they should elect a Democrat because that party is now in charge of both houses of the State Legislature and the governor\u2019s mansion.\n\n\u201cLook, Cathy Young was in the majority and she delivered: That\u2019s how she got it done,\u201d Mr. Morgan said, sitting in his storefront campaign headquarters in Jamestown, N.Y. \u201cWith a Democratic majority, the only way we\u2019re getting funding, or legislation or attention from Albany is from someone who is going to be in that Democratic caucus room.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Mr. Morgan is unstinting in his praise of Ms. Young; in accepting the nomination in March he called her \u201ca titan of Albany,\u201d and said he voted for her in 2018.\n\nBut he is unapologetic about his disdain for his opponent, Mr. Borrello, the Chautauqua County executive, accusing him of using \u201ca great deal of vitriolic, divisive, hateful rhetoric in this campaign,\u201d including calling Albany \u201cthe bowels of hell,\u201d something Mr. Morgan says is an insult to the civil servants working there.\n\n\u201cThey are beautiful hard-working good people,\u201d he said. (Mr. Borrello said the remark was made in jest. \u201cMy opponent has nothing else to talk about,\u201d he said, \u201cso he has to make mountains out of molehills.\u201d)\n\nMr. Morgan has a compelling personal biography: He grew up on 10 acres in the small rural town of Freedom, N.Y., in a \u201csingle-wide trailer on a dirt road.\u201d His father is a mechanic and his mother is a teacher\u2019s aide.\n\nLast year, while still a student at Cornell, he interned in Albany with state Senator Leroy Comrie of Queens, and discovered a niche in education and agricultural policy. While he praised Mr. Comrie as \u201cthe best example of a public servant I could think of,\u201d Mr. Morgan is more conservative than most downstate Democrats, voicing support for gun rights, for instance, and questioning elements of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s signature gun-control law, the SAFE Act.\n\nHe admits he has an uphill battle \u2014 Ms. Young defeated her Democratic challenger in 2016 with 79 percent of the vote, and ran unopposed in 2018.\n\nMr. Borrello says he respects Mr. Morgan\u2019s precocious pluck, but believes he would do a better job of cutting bipartisan deals in Albany\u2019s often back-room bargaining sessions than the inexperienced Mr. Morgan.\n\n\u201cWithout having a strong person in the role of state senator, so much of what we do locally is in jeopardy,\u201d said Mr. Borrello, who was a businessman before entering public office and still owns and operates a pair of beachfront bars and restaurants in Sunset Bay, N.Y., on Lake Erie. \u201cI\u2019m used to being told that you\u2019re not going to get things accomplished and then going above and beyond.\u201d\n\nMr. Borrello does not seem concerned with any dampening effect that Mr. Trump might have on Republican prospects. \u201cThe chief executive I\u2019m most worried about is in Albany,\u201d he said, referencing Mr. Cuomo, \u201cnot Washington.\u201d\n\nMs. Doorley, who was first elected as Democrat in 2011 before switching her party affiliation in 2015, said she did not vote for Mr. Trump in 2016, and called the Republicans \u201cthe party that I run on to be able to do my job,\u201d saying district attorneys should be apolitical.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really running on my record and my relationship with the community,\u201d she said, noting drops in both local jail population and overdose rates during her tenure, something she attributes to her office\u2019s prosecution of heroin dealers in the county and prevention efforts.\n\nThe Soros connection to the race, however, is undeniable, and one that the state Republican Party attacked, calling Mr. Soros \u201ca radical liberal\u201d who is \u201ctrying to infiltrate New York\u2019s criminal justice system.\u201d\n\nWhitney Tymas, a senior adviser for the Justice and Public Safety PAC, said their efforts in New York and other states were nonpartisan and based solely on their interests in reforming the criminal justice system.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re really doing is leveling the playing field,\u201d Ms. Tymas said, noting the inherent advantages of incumbency and often low voter engagement in district attorney races. She added that Ms. Mitchell\u2019s focus on bail reform and her pledge to address the overcharging of defendants \u201caligned with our values.\u201d\n\nMs. Doorley, who is the president-elect of the District Attorneys Association of the State of New York, said she rejected criticisms of her record, but acknowledged that the onslaught of advertisements for her opponent were a challenge.\n\n\u201cYou know what I say to my D.A.s all over the country? No one\u2019s safe,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know why, you don\u2019t know where, but you could be the next target.\u201d",

We *are* called to be good stewards of the planet. I think we failed in that goal heavily, and will likely have to answer for that to most High.\n\nOn the other hand, there is only so much that North America and the EU (the areas where Christians tend to populate the most) can do about the other 5-6 billion souls who appear to be working overtime to contribute their share to the problem. \n\n-Mainland China is a toxic cesspool of smog and filth to the point where respiratory diseases appear to be skyrocketing and large chunks of land will soon be almost as habitable as Chernobyl. And there is no end in site. That whole country is about as healthy as Gary, Indiana was in the 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s. Thats not to mention the inevitable human toll as respiratory illnesses skyrocket in the near future.\n\n-India and that region has been fatally clogging its rivers with garbage, sewage, and toxic waste to the point where it makes Lake Erie, circa 1980\u2019s look like a tree huggers paradise. And if you think that\u2019s bad now, wait until we see the damage caused by all the industries moving there in the past decade or so. I have feeling we may be seeing a second China-sized pollution bomb there as well. Thats a massive mess that isn\u2019t going to clean itself up any time soon...\n\n-Brazil is rapidly and semi-permanently burning down most of the Amazon forest (as to why, I have never understood...), which is cutting off a much-needed source of foliage that is needed to consume and exchange massive amounts of co2 into usable o2. \n\nSo yeah, those three isolated situations alone are likely contributing massive amounts of pollution of the likes the rest of the western world will never be able to compensate for, regardless of the effort put forth. And its only getting worse.\n\nQuite frankly, I\u2019m not sure what can be done now. Even if the west cuts themselves off from purchasing products made by Chinese industry (which is next to impossible, since it would take at a minimum several generations to be able to make such a transition), doing that only hurts the majority population who depend on the work. Damned if we do, damned if we don't And quite likely, the Communist leadership simply don\u2019t care, they will sell their wares elsewhere. As well, there is little that can be done for the aforementioned areas in the short-term as well. \n\nPoint being, the US, Canada, and the EU could cut their pollution and emissions by 150%, and probably the best that would do is slow down the inevitable. Meanwhile, the world population should be hitting 8 billion in another 2-3 years, and rapidly growing from there.\n\nI\u2019m all-in for providing assistance and relief and compassion to areas in dire need. My wife and I contribute roughly 20% of our income to supporting children in need and countries that are facing environmental hardships due to global warming, which is frankly all we can afford at the moment. But it nevertheless feels to us like it results in very little help... :(\n\nQuestion I have for those who blame the US and the rest of the civilized western world is, what are we supposed to do about those countries who contribute to world pollution the most, but listen the least? \n\nWhen it comes to plastic pollution, most groups here blame the US. But according to Earth Day Network, the US comes in at #20, behind 19 other countries from Asia and the Middle East, who easily dwarf the US by an order of magnitude. When it comes to the most polluted countries in the world, the US and the EU barely even register in comparison. \n\nYes, the US does have a pretty bad track record in co2 emissions historically. But, it has managed to stabilize its co2 output that is virtually the same as it was 20 years ago (0.5% increase), while Chinas has risen by approximately 350% in the same time period and outputs twice as much Co2 emissions as the US. Meanwhile, the US has done quite a bit to take care of the low hanging fruit, pollution-wise. But alternative energies are still too expensive, and technologies for alternative energies are still not at the point where they can effectively replace fossil fuel, natural gas and nuclear energy sources. Electric cars are still too limited in range, too expensive (although hybrids have made a good-sized dent), and there is still very little infrastructure built to effectively make them a replacement for fossil fuel powered vehicles. And even when that does happen, it will still take at least 2-3 decades to achieve the transition even in the best of circumstances. Meanwhile, our urban areas are in no way equipped to handle the transition to alternative energies of the magnitude required to make such a sudden transition realistically feasible. In other words, further noticeable progress is going to take much more financial investment just to merely keep up with current trends. The easy works already been done. From where Im sitting, its all uphill from here - much more expensive, and much more difficult.\n\nEven if the US had been able to implement the best liberal environmental wet dream come true - on time, how would you realistically prevent the other 4/5's of the world from doing what they are doing? Talk hasn\u2019t exactly worked. When you look at maps such as [this](https://www.numbeo.com/pollution/rankings_by_country.jsp?title=2019-mid) it makes it readily apparent that  there is very little that North America and the EU can do to contain the primary factors that contribute to global warming and overall destruction of the environment. But Im certainly open to suggestions.\n\n\"E'en So, Lord Jesus, Quickly Come\u201d...",

        "&gt;but the criticism they got for that was nowhere near what they dished out to Gens X, Y and Z (which is what this particular comment thread is about). \n\nWe must be researching different ways then.\n\nThose boomers *did* get a ration of shit back in the 60s, 70s, and 80s. Or maybe you don't know... I don't know. It was on tv, and in magazines, in songs and movies, and all that stuff. Even simple stuff like pointing out that long hair on dudes was a no-go for a job hire, you know? \n\nSo they go their full ration. I'm sticking with that. We can start digging up references if you want, I don't care. They got some shit, and rightfully so.\n\nWhat I don't think you understand, though, is that them getting one turd doesn't mean that anyone else got no turds or extra turds or whatever. It's not a zero-sum turd game. The boomers got their turd, got pissy, threw on suits and power ties, and then made sure that everyone else before and after them got two, three, five turds at a time. Sometimes more. \n\nSo me saying that the boomers got a single turd doesn't detract or distract from the full turd ensemble bouquet that they've piled onto later generations (and sometimes earlier ones!). It's more of a comparison and contrast. Boomers are like 'my life was shitty too, see?' and take that one lil turdnugget as proof positive that they were just as oppressed, screwed over, or messed with. \n\n&gt;It's really only since Millennials started hitting their 30s, realized how fucked they are and why and were able to speak up about in a big way that Boomers have been seriously called out.\n\nI think it's less a thing on age, and more on finally 'outnumbering the idiots where it matters' (financially and politically) as again, even a quick google can show you dozens and dozens of articles criticizing capitalism, shitty corporate practices, environmental concerns and so forth.\n\nIn other words, when you get to make the laws and collect the cash, you get the power. The boomers, as a general whole, gained all the power, simple as that.\n\n\nThe problem is that once they 'gained power' (meaning, were old enough to be the editors and producers and such that took over), then the tune changed from 'look at this demographic of dipshits' to 'look how awesome we are, and how hard we worked to get here, and these damn generation Xers all are lazy pieces of shit\"\n\nand then \"these damn generation Yers are all lazy pieces of shit\"\n\nand even \"these damn silent generationers were all commie socialist pieces of shit\"\n\nAnd so on. \n\nDeflecting and projecting as hard as they can because... well... I dont know. I assume its because boomers only buy stuff that make boomers feel better which makes boomers more money so they can create more stuff that makes boomers feel better, but that's another argument. \n\nAnd considering the boomers have been 'in power' since the 80s, and it's now damn near 40 years later, that's 40 fucking years of \"We are awesome and you guys suck shit\" class-war-masquerading-as-age-war propaganda. \n\n&gt;Not really. Not when schools and parks and housing and cheap college and family wages and pensions were laid out for them.\n\nThey also experienced fuel crises and S&amp;L scandals and the first death knells of unions and Lake Erie catching fire and so on and so forth. I bring this up specifically not to be all 'wah wah think of the boomers' but to make sure you're aware of their mindset. \n\nThey think because they went from paying 40 cents a gallon to a dollar twenty a gallon for gas (and still made ends meet), later generations can handle gas going from two bucks to six bucks. \n\nThey think because they retired from the same company 40 years later with a nice pension and a paid off car, house, etc, that young kids are idiots for getting downsized or fired or jumping ship, even though in a lot of cases, those same companies those boomers worked for don't even exist, or the jobs have long since been deprecated, outsourced, or automated. \n\nThey think because they held a turd for one time back in 1963 when they were grounded for listening to that \"commie rock and roll, like in that movie Footloose which was obviously based off a 100% true story\", all turds are therefore the same size, shape, and consistency, and can be easily taken care of by throwing money at it, or at least a big enough paper towel... all while forgetting that, well, money just isn't around as much as it was before, and ever since we closed down the paper towel manufacturing plants here, they just don't make towels like they used to because Walmart needs to make an extra few cents per roll sold nowadays. \n\nSo keep that in mind. Realize that they did experience some bullshit, some on their own, some from unrelated circumstances. Because this will be the hill they choose to fight on when you tell someone \"ok boomer\". This will be their 'ace in the hole' when you try to point out how you are currently holding a turd (again, regardless of size, shape, etc). Because they're still so self-centered and narcissistic, they can't see anything other than what made them feel bad, and their big plan is to just make sure others are force to hold turds too as some sort of fucked up 'rite of passage'.",

        "&gt;We can shut down two of the six reactors at Pickering and just backfill from Quebec for a cheap option.   \n\nFirst off we have already shut down 2 of Pickering's reactors, with 2 more to go in 2022 and the other 4 in 2024.  So that will be 3GW of nuclear power gone, or more than 30% of our fleet.  Add to that Darlington is also just beginning rather extensive and long refits. The first of their 1GW reactors has been shut down since 2016 and is supposedly going to be brought back online in 2020.  I'd say Dug Ford has a better chance at winning a beauty pagent than reactor 2 comes back online anytime before 2022.  The next thing is the others are all scheduled to go offline also.  So at any given time we are scheduled to have at least 2 of their reactors offline.  That would reduce our capacity by a further 2 GW.  Bruce currently has 2 reactors offline  and 4 more to begin refitting in 2020, so a significant portion of their output is also going down.  We will need to replace that power with something.  Imports don't cut it.  Of the 37GW of capacity you talk about 13GW is nuclear and we are currently only able to run just under 10GW and that number is about to go down, significantly.  \n\nNext not all generation capacity is equal.  You do realize that we have a number of hydro plants that only run in the summer, right?  Or that much of our hydro is dependent on water levels, so there is more during certain time of the year than other times?  Hydro can't actually run 100% of the time full blast?  You do also realize that we only have about 4.3 GW of wind capacity, right?  We also have over 10GW of gas capacity.  So if we are overstocked in anything, it's gas, not wind.   You also realize that electricity is somewhat geographically limited?  Meaning when Thunderbay needs more electricity, it's not always most economical to fire up a gas plant in Ottawa?  There are also limitations on transmission lines that have to be considered.  \n\nAs for buying power from Quebec, hey why didn't we think of that instead of paying ridiculous amounts of money to refurb our nuclear fleet?  We could just buy hydro from Quebec, and coal electricity from Michigan.  \n\n&gt; If we use hydro from Quebec then why weren\u2019t we doing that already instead of locking into 20 year contracts on new wind farms?    \n\nAnd here's the thing, I noticed you mentioned this in another reply.  Are you aware that all of the new gas plants (and they are all mostly new) also have been done by private investment, and they also have 20 year contracts?  That they also have guaranteed incomes, and that wind contracts are actually the cheapest of the bunch?  The fact is that wind also pairs extremely well with hydro, meaning while the wind is blowing the reservoir's can be refilled (think like recharging a battery) and when the wind slacks off, hydro can come online.  See when you pair the two, it takes a great portion of the variability out of the mix.  You may also may have heard about a new hydro tunnel they completed a few years ago in Niagara Falls.  The government spent a $1.5 billion, and what we got was about 3% more capacity for Sir Adam Beck.  What most people don't realize is the actual purpose of the new tunnel.  It was to ensure we had sufficient capacity for when the lake levels are lower.  I know (I live on lake Erie) the past couple of years we have had historically high lake levels, but the decade before that we had historically low lake levels, like 3 to 6 feet lower.  When we return to that, and we will, without the new tunnel, we may still be screwed hard for hydro.  So having other forms of generation is not a bad idea.    \n\nFrom your other reply:   \n\n&gt;That reduction didn\u2019t come from replacing coal with wind farms. It came from the huge reductions in demand and job losses when corporations moved manufacturing to Mexico and China and elsewhere.    \n\nUh, most of the companies that could move to China or Mexico did so in the 90's or early 2000's, not in the past 10 years.  Manufacturing has made a small comeback in the past 10 years.  The drop you have seen is more substantially due to decreased demands through conservation than it is lack of industrial demand.  If you look at the IESO's own website, they are pretty specific in relating that conservation has been responsible for a drop in demand of 15.7TW, which is about 10%, since 2006.  \n\n&gt;We have almost twice as much capacity as demand. We could lose almost half of our grid and not worry about brownouts. Now who is making the stupid point?    \n\nAs I pointed out earlier, all capacity isn't equal, and not all of the 37GW of capacity is currently available.  A nuclear reactor that is shut down for a 4 year period still get's counted, yet provides zero electricity.  So it's actually you making the stupid point here.    \n\n&gt;That reduction didn\u2019t come from replacing coal with wind farms.    \n\nUh, well we did bring a number of reactors from Bruce back online, so that helped. But we also produce about what 8% of our power from Wind?  That is nothing to sneeze at.    \n\n&gt;Sorry, I missed the part where the electricity is being provided for free and not being paid for by taxpayers in the form of higher electricity rates.     \n\nMy point was that the billions invested didn't come from the government's coffers, it's all private investment.  As for rates, you might want to look at the deregulation that Mike Harris shoved down our throats and see how that actually impacted our electrical rates.  We used to have Ontario Hydro that generated and transmitted all of the power to your local power company, which often was municipally owned.  So we had 2 crown corporations selling us electricity.  Now we have at least 4 private for profit companies from generation to home that all have to make a profit.  Wonder why our rates have gone so high?  Hint, it has almost nothing to do with paying $.115/kwh of wind powered electricity, versus $.133/kwh for gas powered electricity.   \n\n&gt;Strange how all new wind farms still justify their existence on their websites by comparing themselves to coal powered generation even though it doesn\u2019t exist anymore.    \n\nYeah, strange why coal's replacement compares itself to coal.  Are you for real????   \n\n&gt;The most cost effective practical solution by far is nuclear.   \n\nOh, yes, maybe Dug will commit the $20 billion today that would be needed to build a new nuclear plant.  FFS, there is good reason why almost no new nuclear plants are being built outside of Russia, China and India, because they are expensive, and they won't deliver power for 20 years.   \n\n&gt;I\u2019d argue the rest of your points but you\u2019re too drunk on the green koolaid    \n\nUmm, you would have to have a clue as to what you are talking about first to even counter anything I have said.  Yes Dug Ford is an idiot, if you can't see that, it's probably because he's smarter than you.",

        "I wish. But it's not that simple.\n\nIn 1763, following the Seven Years War, the British Crown annexed of New France. Britain needed to develop a strategy for governing its new territories. The result, the [Royal Proclamation of 1763](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Proclamation_of_1763), is the basis for all relationships between First Nations peoples and the settler population. It is enshrined in the Canadian constitution (s. 25).\n\nThe Proclamation lays out the groundwork for incorporating North America's native people under the British Crown:\n\n&gt;And whereas it is just and reasonable, and essential to our Interest, and the Security of our Colonies, that the several Nations or Tribes of Indians with whom We are connected, and who live under our Protection, should not be molested or disturbed in the Possession of such Parts of Our Dominions and Territories as, not having been ceded to or purchased by Us, are reserved to them. or any of them, as their Hunting Grounds.\n\nThe wording here is crucial: it establishes a nation-to-nation relationship between the British crown and the \"several Nations or Tribes of Indians who live under our protection.\" Every subsequent treaty must be viewed through this lens.\n\n---\n\nHow did the 1763 Proclamation play out in practice? Here's one example: the [Haldimand Proclamation of 1784](http://www.sixnations.ca/LandsResources/HaldProc.htm) and its long-term effects: the alienated northern thirty miles, the Grand River Navigation Company fiasco, and the theft of the entire accumulated wealth of a sovereign nation.\n\nDuring the American Revolutionary War, [the Six Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iroquois) fought on the side of the British and were promised land in Canada in the event of a British loss. After the war, the Iroquois settled on land in Southern Ontario, the Haldimand Tract. Per the 1763 Proclamation, the land was first [purchased from the Mississaugas of the Credit](http://mncfn.ca/treaty3/) and then a portion of that purchased land was granted to the Iroquois. This was not a kindness -- it was a political necessity at the time given the thousands of pissed-off Iroquois warriors encamped in Niagara awaiting their promised reward.\n\nLook closely at the Haldimand Tract map above. Here's a version [from the early 1800's](https://tworowtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/DSCF5384-1.jpg). Here is [a similar map ](http://erbstchurch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/haldimand-tract.png) with clearer labels. If you're familiar with the Waterloo area, the shapes might be very familiar -- these blocks are [identical](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Map_of_Waterloo_County%2C_Ontario%2C_1883.png) to the modern township borders of the County of Waterloo (and Nichol and Pilkington townships of [Wellington County](https://imgc.allpostersimages.com/img/print/u-g-PHG7YH0.jpg?w=900&amp;h=900&amp;p=0) as well).\n\nOn the map of the actual Haldimand Proclamation, did you notice the missing north half? Read Haldimand's original proclamation:\n\n&gt; I do hereby in His Majesty's name authorize and permit the said Mohawk Nation and such others of the Six Nation Indians as wish to settle in that quarter to take possession of and settle upon the Banks of the River commonly called Ouse or Grand River, running into Lake Erie, allotting to them for that purpose six miles deep from each side of the river beginning at Lake Erie and extending in that proportion to the head of the said river, which them and their posterity are to enjoy for ever.\n\n**From the mouth to the head.** But later, the Crown would argue that \"you can't grant what you don't own,\" and refused to make up for the difference. Breaking the contract, with no redress for the losing party. [Some more details here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haldimand_Proclamation#Extent_of_the_lands)\n\nSo the grant was cut by a third. But the Six Nations still owned the Grand River tract from the source to Elora, right? Yes, but...\n\nThe Six Nations chose to sell the northern blocks to white settlers. It was initially disputed whether or not this grant fell under the rules of the 1763 Proclamation (Indians cannot sell land to settlers) or if the Haldimand Tract grant was freehold like the other land grants to Revolutionary War veterans. In 1798, the acting British lieutenant governor agreed that the Six Nations could sell, provided that the Crown have the first opportunity to buy the land. At this time, most of the remaining grant was sold to the government.\n\n---\n\nBut here's the most important question, the one that gets glossed over: **where did the money go?**\n\nFollowing the War of 1812, settler views towards the native population shifted. No longer needed to defend the land from possible American incursion, and based on the language used in some treaties, natives in Canada were relegated to the status of \"crown ward\": treated legally as children unable to take care of their own affairs. The proceeds from the Six Nations land sales, and from mineral and timber rights, were put into a trust, managed by white settler trustees. \n\nEnter canal fever in the form of the [Grand River Navigation Company](https://grandriversaga.com/journal/the-river-the-indians-and-the-navigation/)  (editorialized, but informative). Canals like Erie, Lachine, and Welland were crucial in opening up the interior of the North American continent to settlement and access to markets, and Southern Ontario wanted in. Many of the original settlers on the northern reaches of the Grand River wanted a navigable waterway, but the river itself was shallow and fast-moving. They secure funding to build a canal, including from the Six Nations Trust, and start construction in 1832. \n \nIt was a bad investment. The canal never turned a profit -- but this wasn't a problem for the initial investors! They, after all, also happened to be trustees of the Six Nations Trust. By 1840, the Six Nations Trust owned 80% of the canal company, without the consent of the actual Six Nations themselves. By 1844, the nation was bankrupt.\n\nBy 1854, of course, there was a railway to Buffalo and the canal was unnecessary.\n\nWe bought their land from them, but kept their money in trust. We then used our government power to force them to bail out bad investments until they were bankrupt. 150 years later, with no source of income (we took all their land and mineral rights) and no starting capital, they're still bankrupt.\n\nMeanwhile, the Canal made the entire city of Brantford possible. It accelerated the growth of Berlin (now at the center of Waterloo Region, the tenth-largest metro area in the country.) The white settlers of the Haldimand Tract benefited, but the canal never profited and and the Six Nations went bankrupt.\n\nThat trust was valued at \u00a340000 in 1820. This is the equivalent of $5,000,000 - $20,000,000 today. Here's something to consider: had the Six Nations Confederacy been allowed to invest their own money in their own economy over the past 160 years, the initial investment of forty thousand pounds would have needed to beat inflation by just a 3.8%-4.7% growth rate per year to be valued at eight billion dollars today. (About seven to eight percent growth long term.) Given how the rest of Ontario grew during that same period, (and ignoring that this is just *one* trust fund raid and the eight billion dollar settlement is for the entire country) it really sounds like we're getting off pretty light.\n\n---\n\nThis is just one story of one nation (that I happen to know because I live nearby). It's not even the complete story: [see here about how they bailed out indebted Ontario universities.](https://tworowtimes.com/historical/six-nations-funded-colleges-universities-never-repaid/) There are stories like this across the country, of financial fraud leading to impoverished native nations. These nations are still suffering from the results. Please notice I didn't discuss any other government policies against the first nations people -- nothing in here is about the forced assimilation, kidnapping, judicial discrimination, or outright murder to which any person under Canadian law would be entitled to compensation and punitive damages.\n\nI'll leave you with a modern parallel. Another case of how trustees, bound to act in the best interests of their beneficiaries, are instead using that trust money to bail out bad investments. I'm talking about public investment in the oil and gas industry. There are a lot of ways in which the average Canadian is financially exposed to the oil and gas sector: pension plans, mass-market mutual funds, public institution endowments. All of these institutions have investment policies which limit them to \"low-risk\" investments -- stocks listed on major exchanges, and bonds with investment-grade ratings.\n\nBut who decides what's low risk? It's really just a few private corporations: credit ratings corporations like Moody's and S&amp;P, and the decisions of the stock exchanges regarding which stocks can be listed. These few private corporations are intentionally ignoring the threat of climate change and its effect on specific industries, making them appear to be safe investments. The media is playing a role, too -- constantly pushing the narrative that oil and gas are the best investments, while downplaying or ignoring the looming threat of climate change. \n\nIf this sounds familiar, it's because the credit rating agencies did the same thing -- in that case, repackaging junk debt into higher-rated securities -- just before the 2008 recession, to convince institutional investors to buy.\n\nKeep this in mind if you have a retirement fund, own mutual funds, or work for an employer that still has a pension plan. The people who control your savings are directing them into investments that we know are bad. They are part of a system that gives them the power to use your money to bail out their bad investments. Just like the Six Nations in 1820.",

Other sightings were likely just big sturgeon\n* Myth: Cleveland was home to the first permanent traffic light\n* Truth: **True** Yes, at Euclid and E 105th.  But it was not the version invented by Garrett Morgan\n* Myth: The Ohio Bell building (Now AT&amp;T building) inspired the Daily Planet.\n* Truth: **False**.  Joe Shuster says it was based on the Daily Star in Toronto, where he grew up.  And the building did not appear until a 1940s cartoon which looks more like the NYC Paramount Building.  \n* Myth: Municipal Stadium was built for a 1932 Olympic bid\n* Truth: **False** The Olympics were awarded to LA in August 1928, and Cleveland didn't vote on the bond issue for the stadium until November.  It was built to replace League Park.  \n* Myth: Sweetest Day was invented by American Greetings. \n* Truth: **False** It was started in 1921 by Cleveland candy companies, not American Greetings\n* Myth: There were 1.3M at the Cavs victory parade\n* Truth: **Probably not** RTA estimates 500,000 people used RTA, and a mathematical analysis puts the number at 800,000.  But there is no way to know.  The number apparently came from Anthony Lima\n\nEdit: formatting and spelling.",

        "Full text:\n\n&gt; Sunset on a summer night in Buffalo. Fifty-odd people are practising their downward dogs on the lawn by the waterfront, the shoreline of Canada appearing upside down between their knees. In front of them, dozens more are on the river, taking to the water in kayaks, sightseeing boats and even \u2014 because this is America \u2014 motorised floating tiki bars.\n&gt; \n&gt; A few miles south, people are packing up after a day on the beach at Lake Erie: sand the best kind of beige, water glassily still, accessed via a sylvan glade. And across the water from the yogis, a mother deer is guiding Bambi quietly through the reeds in the marshland of a nature reserve.\n&gt; \n&gt; Welcome to the Rust Belt.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tell an American you\u2019re going on holiday to Buffalo and they\u2019ll splutter. To them, the Queen City \u2014 nicknamed during its 19th-century heyday, when it was coining it in as a transport hub, at the mouth of the Erie Canal \u2014 lost her crown decades ago. For many, it means little more than chicken wings, harsh winters and postindustrial decay.\n&gt; \n&gt; They have a point. The Buffalo wings \u2014 deep-fried and tossed in hot sauce \u2014 are inescapable. There was an ice storm when I was there the time before last, in (late) April. And as for that decay \u2014 well, that yoga class takes place under a giant flyover. The nature reserve, Times Beach, was created on a former industrial dumping ground. The river that people kayak down without a care in the world was so toxic back in the days when its banks were lined with grain silos and factories that by taking a dip you\u2019d likely have caught either a superbug or a superpower. Today, I\u2019m planning my fifth visit.\n&gt; \n&gt; The first time I went to Buffalo, I only expected to sleep \u2014 it\u2019s a stopover for Niagara Falls, half an hour north. Instead, I ended up falling for the architecture: a Miss America parade from the 19th and early 20th century, including nascent skyscrapers, Frank Lloyd Wright houses and a network of parks by Frederick Law Olmsted, the designer of Central Park. I returned for the regeneration: hipsters playing shuffleboard and munching from food trucks in self-styled \u201cLarkinville\u201d, a retro-looking revamp of an inner-city neighbourhood that draws New York Staters priced out of New York City. My third visit was pure gluttony \u2014 48 hours and several pounds of chicken on the official Wings Trail, which launched this spring.\n&gt; \n&gt; This time, I wanted to sit back and absorb the summer. Because if you want an all-American, easily accessible summer holiday \u2014 addictive junk food, worryingly friendly locals, blue-collar grit and millennial charm \u2014 Buffalo is your place. It\u2019s California meets Coney Island.\n&gt; \n&gt; To do Buffalo right, skip the Big Apple. Fly instead to Toronto \u2014 traffic allowing, it\u2019s less than two hours away. Cross the Canada-US border at its most spectacular point, with Niagara Falls steaming to your right (\u00a34.60 to enter the US). From here, the road follows the Niagara River upstream, rushing over \u201csky bridges\u201d \u2014 grand metal bridges painted cerulean blue. Next, those ancient skyscrapers loom into view: the phallic, art-deco City Hall; the Liberty Building crowned by twin Lady Liberties, torches winking at Canada; the terracotta-tiled Guaranty Building, one of the world\u2019s first skyscrapers now 122 years old. Then that magisterial waterfront: the dead Erie Canal reborn as a summer yoga space (Mondays 12pm, Fridays 6pm; free; canalsidebuffalo.com). Beyond that, elegantly decaying, are the grain silos that made Buffalo\u2019s fortune a century ago.\n&gt; \n&gt; Stay at the Hotel Henry, a dark, forbidding twin-towered building that looks like a Victorian mental asylum, because it was one. It\u2019s now been converted into an airy, high-ceilinged resort of astonishingly good taste (doubles from \u00a3125, B&amp;B; hotelhenry.com). Eat at one of \u201cnew\u201d Buffalo\u2019s restaurants, such as Dapper Goose, where you sit on a plant-fringed patio and eat the kind of veg-heavy farm-to-table food you last tried in San Francisco. I recommend the mustard-laced Brussels sprouts (mains about \u00a315; thedappergoose.com).\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; During the day, you\u2019ll want to hit the water. Drive eight miles south, following the lake, and turn right at the giant Ford plant, to Woodlawn Beach State Park. A boardwalk takes you through a primeval-looking, tree-plugged marsh, over 12ft dunes and down to Florida-grade sand, where boisterous Buffalonians wedge their beer coolers into the sand and a bar blasts gems such as Will Smith\u2019s Miami. It\u2019s blue-collar America at its raucous best, and in August the water\u2019s a comfy 24C.\n&gt; \n&gt; From there, Frank Lloyd Wright\u2019s Graycliff is 10 miles further south. A sober lakeside retreat built for the soap-magnate Martin family, its extensive renovations are due to finish next month, though it\u2019s already open for guided tours. Either way, for once, Wright isn\u2019t the star \u2014 it\u2019s the sunken garden, shaded by enormous pines and with views across Lake Erie that you\u2019re going for (tours from \u00a314; experiencegraycliff.org).\n&gt; \n&gt; Make sure you\u2019re back in town at dusk to catch the Queen City Bike Ferry \u2014 a little barge for cyclists and pedestrians \u2014 from Canalside to the Outer Harbor, on the other side of the river. It runs until Labor Day weekend, which this year is September 3 (75p; queencityferry.com). Head to Times Beach, where a patch of woodland gives way to marsh, and walkways cantilevered over the water get you closer to the wildlife: owls, terns and those Bambis.\n&gt; \n&gt; And you\u2019ll need some river time. Start with the Buffalo River History Tour, which spins you round the harbour, towards Canada, and along the river, telling you about the Erie Canal, Buffalo\u2019s heyday and its regeneration (90min \u00a316; buffaloriverhistorytours.com). It takes you past those monumental silos that now stand empty \u2014 of grain, at least, if not of soul. Because as great as the regeneration and the hipsters and the beaches are, Silo City \u2014 a collection of six gently corroding titans dating back to 1906, south of the city centre \u2014 is where you\u2019ll really fall for Buffalo.\n&gt; \n&gt; Today, these cathedrals of industry have been turned into art spaces, with aerial installations in cavernous cement chambers that were once filled with ton upon ton of grain, and host events, such as poetry readings and concerts, throughout the summer.\n&gt; \n&gt; Caretaker \u201cSwannie\u201d Jim Watkins (nicknamed after the Swannie House, a dive bar he used to frequent, on the other side of the river) lives here in an old maintenance shed, with his dog, Gonzo. Swannie has a big white beard and the air of a prophet. Wander on site (you can also book tours or come for a specific event \u2014 see silo.city for details) and, depending on how much beer he\u2019s drunk, he\u2019ll either shoo you off or hand you a Bud and proselytise about dying concrete. Soon enough, you\u2019ll realise your love for Buffalo is as solid as its silos.\n&gt; \n&gt; Niagara Falls? Not when there\u2019s a barbecue at Swannie\u2019s on the cards.\n&gt; \n&gt; Julia Buckley was a guest of Visit Buffalo Niagara (visitbuffaloniagara.com) and British Airways. BA now flies to Toronto from Gatwick, as well as Heathrow, from \u00a3403 (ba.com)\n&gt; ",

        "This trip took place on Sunday July 29th, the day after my Cedar Point visit as I was driving back to North Carolina. Finally getting around to talking about these notable woodies.\n\n#Waldameer\n\nThis is a cute park, but don't be mistaken - it's absolutely tiny and offers zero views of Lake Erie outside of RFII's lift. Just keep those expectations in mind, and you'll find an incredibly pleasant little mini-Knoebels. Also, most rides don't open until 1pm, so arriving at 12-sharp (like I did) is not necessary.\n\n###Comet\n\nFelt nice to experience an extended PTC kiddie coaster. It has awesome tree cover (that ancient oak rising above the station is astounding!) and a few fun pops of airtime.\n\n###Ravine Flyer II\n\nDamn, this coaster blew me away. It felt like a mix of Boulder Dash's terrain interaction with Cheetah at Wild Adventures' layout - only RFII is a hell of a lot smoother than either of those. The magic seat is red train 2nd-to-last row, btw. It delivers insane airtime in its two ravine hills and insane positive-G's in its tunnels as you rush up the hillside. This thing never loses speed, though it's also a little bit shorter than I expected. You'll sit on the brake run for a bit before the next train dispatches, but it's a great moment to catch your breath. An absolutely fabulous attraction - definitely in my top five wooden coasters. Waldameer should be proud to have such a great coaster in such great shape. It's a can't-miss ride if you're ever driving east of Cedar Point.\n\n###Ravine Flyer 3\n\nCute water features for a dinky E&amp;F Miler credit.\n\n###Whacky Shack\n\nAside from the obnoxiously short repeat-cycle narration in the queue, this was a great little dark ride with some of the better and more unique effects I've ever experienced. Another can't-miss if you opt for a wristband.\n\n###Pirate's Cove\n\nThis walkthrough funhouse has some gloriously funny moments. It's not as flashy as Whacky Shack, but its absurd levels of camp and charm make it more memorable.\n\n### Steel Dragon\n\nThis is definitely the odd-one-out among Waldameer's attractions, with its plopped-down nature and nonexistent theming. Still, these Maurer spinning coasters are great rides (RIP Xtreme from my native Blue Bayou/Dixie Landin'), though Steel Dragon definitely faces stiff competition from Laff Trakk to the east.\n\n#Conneaut Lake Park\n\nDang this park is tiny and disorganized. I know it's been on the verge of closing for years, but finding an \"entrance\" and a place to park and the ticket booth proved unusually challenging. Once I orientated myself, it was a cute, though delapidated, little neighborhood park that was fun to explore. Unfortunately, my visit was cut short by rain, so I missed out on ultra-rare flat Tumblebug and lagniappe Blue Streak laps.\n\n###Devil's Den\n\nPeople need to give Steel Vengeance a break; this ride is the king of station bumpage. I was actually kind of shocked to see how much force was imparted from kart to kart as they careened across the loading platform. Luckily I had a quick dispatch and didn't have to suffer a rear-ending, but then you have to face the most demonic of horrors: the gum tunnel. Jesus - this was the most stockpiled \"gum monument\" I've ever witnessed in person. The rest of the dark ride was devilishly fun, too. I'd probably rate it as my favorite \"how is this a credit?\" dark ride - ahead of Hawnted House, Underground, Black Diamond, and Blazing Fury.\n\n###Blue Streak\n\nAfter falling in love with Big Dipper at Camden Park and long lamenting the loss of Pontchartrain Beach's Zephyr, I was eager to ride this Ed Vettel classic with NAD trains. The ops were pretty lively with their over-the-top safety spiel about this *deadly* ancient wooden roller coaster. I took the middle-of-the-middle seat as the rain started coming in - ensuring this would be the last ride for a while. The *multiple* holes in the tunnel leading to the chain lift foretold a sorry state of the attraction that didn't really pan out. I experienced no jackhammering or even mild roughness in my middle-of-the-middle seat, but I also experienced no airtime. Even with raindrops pelting my face and a layout *long* overgrown by native trees, I was disappointed by how mild this ride ended up being. I definitely want to give it another go in the back car at some point, but at the moment I'm more eager to return to my favorite \"gives-no-fucks\" Camden Park.\n\n#Idlewild\n\nMaking more poor decisions for myself, I decided to route Idlewild into my return to North Carolina even though it was already past 3pm at this point. Though this park is ludicrously expensive, it turned out ok since I arrived in time for their sunset discount. This park was positively gorgeous and totally lives up to its marketing tagline as the \"best kids' park in the world\" or whatever. Unfortunately, though, that means you have to put up with those insufferable snotlords every waking moment of your visit. Adding insult to injury, their only-one-in-the-world Vekoma wild mouse was out of commission that day despite their website saying otherwise. Accepting my fate, I got in the longest line of the day for the only credit in the park.\n\n###Rollo Coaster\n\nFirst off, no: this ride's not \"ruined\" by its stupid wing flaps. They don't obstruct nearly as much of your view as people's incessant complaining would have you believe. The thing that ruins this ride is how the over-the-top safety accomodations slow down ops. With only one train seating 12 people and dispatches every 3 minutes, this thing had a crazy long line. Once you're actually in, this ride through the woods is definitely one of the best kiddie coasters I've ever experienced. It's pretty light in the airtime department, especially with the heavy trims on the return trip, but that turnaround delivers some crazy laterals that only *amplify* halfway through when it figures out it can do one of those downward RCT turn-things because why not? This coaster is definitely worth checking out if you're in the area, though I can't say I'm especially eager to wait in line for it ever again.",

First author, senior author, etc)**:\n   * 100 TOTAL HOURS - In my senior year of undergraduate studies, I participated in an immunobiology lab course with Dr. Elliott Blumenthal. The primary objective of the lab was to select a substance that was commercialized as an \"immune booster\", and then to determine if the substance was capable of inhibiting melanoma tumor cell growth, promoting white blood cell proliferation, or both. My chosen substance was green tea extract, and throughout the course, I learned many valuable things about the research process. Learning about and performing the various techniques, procedures, and methods presented in this class showed me the incalculable value of research as it pertains to the medical field. Presentations, research papers, no publications\n   * 100 TOTAL HOURS - In my last year of undergraduate studies, I completed a Senior Thesis Research course in the Biology Department at Indiana University - Purdue University Fort Wayne. I was tasked with finding a topic that was related to the field of biology, developing a hypothesis, identifying and citing peer-reviewed literature sources in support of my hypothesis, and analyzing/interpreting available data to either confirm or reject the original hypothesis. A manuscript encompassing each of these aspects was produced, and a final presentation was given to faculty members and peers at the end of the semester. My topic covered the viability of green algae as a sustainable alternative fuel source. Presentations, manuscript, no publication\n   * 250 TOTAL HOURS -  As an undergraduate researcher for the Student Research Fellowship Program, I was able to work with Dr. Hamdeep Singh and Dr. Anna Menze, DO on a project concerning the shifting trends in childhood obesity and the effects of educational group visits on body image, activity levels, and healthy lifestyle on youths. My primary role was analysis of data and development of an abstract and manuscript. During this project, I was able to work closely with medical students, residents, and physicians through the Indiana University School of Medicine and the Fort Wayne Medical Education Program. Manuscript/abstract, no presentation or publication\n   * 120 TOTAL HOURS -  I performed research with Dr. Jordan Marshall and graduate student Andrea Meyer on biodiversity and plant/arthropod interactions within various forest communities, and specifically how arthropod diversity affects plant regrowth in deforested areas. My main priorities were assessment of soil/arthropod samples that were collected by Dr. Marshall and Andrea, collection of data from these assessments, and then analyzing the data to determine if arthropod diversity and forest regrowth are positively correlated. The project culminated with me writing a 15 page manuscript that summarized research methods, presented data/statistical analyses, and made conclusions about the research.

Students go out to various places around the city and perform services for different organizations. When I participated, I performed services at the Animal Care and Control Center in Fort Wayne. I was able to help clean facilities, interact with the people who work there and learn about their jobs, and of course, play with all of the animals!\n   * 1 DAY/12 TOTAL HOURS - At NEIRSEF, I served as a volunteer judge. I helped assess and judge various science projects within a large group of elementary-aged students. My responsibilities were looking at posters, listening to students give a brief presentation of their work, and conducting a short question and answer session with the intention of giving constructive feedback. This was a very enjoyable experience for me; I was able to encourage the children and congratulate them for their hard work. I was also able to practice the skill of communicating somewhat complex science topics with young children, which I feel can be an important skill to have as a physician.\n   * 200 TOTAL HOURS - Teaching and playing guitar is a fun, relaxing side activity that I like to engage in when I have some spare time. I have a small group a children who are trying to learn guitar, and I meet with them every once in a while to teach them about different chords, scales, techniques, and how to read sheet music. I have been playing guitar since I was 15 years old, and it has been a great hobby for me to have. When I would get bogged down with studying for the MCAT or undergraduate courses, taking a break and writing music, playing songs, and teaching were great ways for me to relax, refresh myself, and re-focus on the work I needed to get done.\n   * 130 TOTAL HOURS - I served as a volunteer at the Fort Wayne Rescue Mission in the summer of 2016. The Rescue Mission is a temporary shelter for homeless men and battered women, with the goal of helping these men and women rehabilitate and learn necessary life skills in a safe, encouraging, and non-judgmental environment. When I was at the Rescue Mission, most of my volunteering was spent serving 7 A.M. breakfast to the residents of the Rescue Mission, along with a portion of the homeless population in downtown Fort Wayne. I helped clean the cafeteria, and talked with residents of the mission after serving breakfast.\n* **Extracurricular activities**: Nothing of note\n* **Employment history**: \n   * 2200 hours of direct patient care experience, working jobs as both an EKG technician and a patient care associate in the ER at a mid-sized community hospital\n   * 1.5 years/300 hours as a supplemental instructor (pretty much a TA) for undergraduate chemistry courses at my university.\n* **Please include time span and weekly commitment for volunteering/research/shadowing/extracurriculars.**: N/A, listed above\n* **Immediate family members in medicine?

        "If you want a romantic dinner overlooking Lake Erie with the best seafood in town, try Pier W in Lakewood. I will highly recommend checking out the art galleries and shops as well as Presti's Bakery, and pretty much any restaurant in Little Italy...you could use it for dinner or for lunch as you hang out at University Circle\u2014the Cleveland Museum of Art and the Botanical Gardens are excellent, and the Crawford Auto &amp; Aviation Museum/Cleveland History Museum are great too...they have the restored Euclid Beach Carousel inside too. Another good spot would be the Happy Dog at the Euclid Tavern, and you might be able to score tickets for a concert with the Cleveland Orchestra at Severance Hall (which is incredible!) one evening if you want a more highbrow experience or just something different to do.\n\nDowntown you want to see the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame, walk through the historic Arcade on Euclid Avenue (one of the nation's first indoor shopping malls, built in 1890), and see the Heinen's Grocery Store in the gorgeous Cleveland Trust Rotunda (built around 1900). Try the soups at Heinen's if you're there in mid morning\u2014I especially love the tomato bisque, but they're all great. You could also see about getting tickets for a Cavaliers basketball game if they're in town that week. Get dinner (and even lunch) on East 4th Street...Greenhouse Tavern is where I love to take out of town friends, and in evening The Butcher and The Brewer is a fun place to eat small plates and drink beer. Mabel's BBQ and Lola are also excellent choices. There are lots of other restaurants Downtown that I haven't gotten to try yet that also sound good. And if you get hungry during the daytime\u2014definitely get a polish boy with sauerkraut from one of the hot dog vendors\u2014I can't resist the temptation e dry time I go down there. You can actually get a super fancy version of the Polish boy in the city's nicer restaurants too...they're one of Cleveland's local foods. End your night with dessert at The Chocolate Bar across Euclid for East 4th in the Arcade.\n\nAnother thing you can look into if you're more about music than sports is a show at the House of Blues, The Agora, Grog Shop, or Beachland Ballroom. If you like jazz, go get dinner and a show at Nighttown in Cleveland Heights. Another good small venue is The Brothers Lounge out near W 117 &amp; Detroit. There are tons of small bars all over town and you can usually find good live music, especially in the city, as well as in Lakewood and Cleveland Heights. You can also check out the theater options at Playhouse Square and at the many smaller theaters around town. The Cedar-Lee Theater in Cleveland Heights shows some more eclectic independent and foreign films if you're into the screen instead of the stage.\n\nAnother place to spend some time is Ohio City\u2014which has the city's brewery district. Great Lakes, Market Garden, Platform, and many others all have restaurants or tasting rooms as so many other breweries. The restaurants down there are excellent too...Town Hall is another favorite restaurant I like to take out of town guests...they have the best people-watching in the city as well as a great menu of food and beer (and their food is GMO-free and some of its organic even, if that's important to you). You definitely want to go down here during the day and make sure you spend some time browsing the vendors at the West Side Market. This 100+ year old public market is the centerpiece of Ohio City, and also has a great breakfast spot in the West Side Market Cafe. Make sure you get Mitchell's Ice Cream!!!\n\nAlso hit Edgewater Park for a great view of the city skyline. Check out the bars and restaurants and galleries and shops in Tremont, Lakewood, Coventry Road in Cleveland Heights, Waterloo Road, and Asiatown. Great pizza at Angelo's Pizza on Madison in Lakewood...also at Vincenza's Downtown for lunch. Check out the 16-Bit Arcade to play old school arcade games for the price of a cocktail or a beer. Side Quest is a fun little general geek/sci-fi lover's bar in Lakewood too.\n\nTake a drive around the Emerald Necklace in the Rocky River &amp; Mill Stream Run Reservations and work your way down to Cuyahoga Valley National Park if you're into nature. Along your way you can see the giant shale cliffs at Scenic Park and near Rocky River Nature Center you can take a trail that has steps to the top. You also can see Berea Falls in the metroparks, and Brandywine Falls and Blue Hen Falls in the National Park. The trail from the Stanford House to Brandywine Falls and the one to Blue Hen &amp; Buttermilk Falls are two of my favorites. You can also rent bikes in Peninsula and ride the Ohio &amp; Erie Towpath Trail a few miles and then take the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad back to your car, and eat at the Winking Lizard for dinner. If you go to CVNP, make sure you stop at a Swenson's for a Galley Boy burger since you'll be down by Akron.\n\nNovember is the month when the weather starts to get more dicey and wintry...I don't think you'll be able to get a cruise on the Goodtime III or the Nautical Queen, but that's another option if they're still running. There's plenty to do up here...you won't get bored! And even food at most nice restaurants is pretty easy on the pocketbook...and there are plenty of less expensive local options, even Downtown.\n\nHave fun!",

        "There are a few reasons for it that come to mind for me.\n\nPeople do have a short memory about this sort of thing.  Which has always been the case.  There is also the factor of people saying \"it won't happen here\" or \"it won't happen again\".  \n\nThose are just part of human nature though.  I don't think there is anything we can do to get rid of those factors.  \n\nHonestly, I think one of the biggest problems with people's lack of preparedness is the \"culture of preparedness\".  I consider myself a prepper and even then a lot of what I see turns me off from it.\n\nI keep my prepping fairly quiet, and I prep for very normal things.  Major storms, large scale power outages, etc etc.  My in laws had no idea I was a prepper until the summer of 2014 (a year after the wife and I got married) when Toledo (where they live) had a toxic algae bloom in Lake Erie and the water for the entire town was dangerous to even touch with your skin for several days and not safe to drink for over a week.\n\nMy wife of course knew I was a prepper and always thought I was a bit crazy about it.

However it wasn't much.  \n\nMany of her family members had gone to Ann Arbor, Cleveland and other \"nearby\" towns two and three hours away to get water and found shelves were empty.\n\nThe wife went to buy some water for them here in Columbus (about 3 hours from Toledo) and found that by the time she got to the store around 10am that they were sold out down here too.\n\nThe wife came home and had this look on her face like she hated that she had to admit that I was right about how fragile our modern infrastructure actually is.  \n\nI loaded up the truck with 20 5 gallon bottles of water that I had in the basement  (Side note, carrying 800 pounds of water up stairs sucks) and we went trucking towards toledo.  \n\nI called two of my buddies to ride up there and help me out with the water deliveries.  I told the wife it was because I wanted help lugging the water.  Really it was because I wanted help securing the water as I had a feeling people would be getting desperate.  We all three have our concealed carry permits.  But that day we all three open carried and made sure to bring a few extra magazines.  I also wore a vest under my shirt, which thankfully was not needed.\n\nThe truck was full when we left town, but with all that extra weight and interstate driving I had to get gas.  My two buddies got out of the truck while I did \"to stretch their legs\".  \n\nWhile nobody got violent and tried to steal our water.  Four or five people did come up to us begging for the water.  Some offered to buy it most just begged for it.\n\nAfter we finish dropping off the water at all of her family's various houses my father in law said something to the effect of \"I'm glad we called you and you were able to grab this water for us in Columbus\".\n\nThen the wife told him that Columbus was sold out too and all this water was already sitting in our basement because I was a \"prepper\".\n\nTheir response was something to the affect of \"But he's a normal person.\".  \n\nBasically, they thought preppers were crazy people.  And I don't really blame people who think that.  Everytime you see or hear about preppers it always comes across as crazy.  People talking about Zombies, Aliens, Nuclear war, The complete collapse of our entire society resulting in a mad max movie, armed uprisings, WW3 etc etc.\n\nThey also talk about how you have to have your own private army and arsenal that could rival a small country and you need to be able to fight like you are a real life action hero.\n\nVery rarely do you hear preppers talking about things like hurricanes, Earthquakes, tornadoes, blizzards, drought, water table contamination, layoffs, etc etc.\n\nEven I, as a prepper get tired of people only talking about the crazy things (that yes, mostly could happen but aren't very likely) and ignoring the things that absolutely will happen.\n\n\nTLDR;\n\n\nWhen the city the In Laws live in had a water crisis and found out I was a prepper by me bringing them 20 5 gallon bottles of water they were surprised I was a prepper because \"I wasn't crazy\".  \n\nMost people consider preppers to be crazy because more preppers talk about things like the complete collapse of society resulting in a mad max movie (which could happen but isn't very likely) instead of things like layoffs due to a bad economy or a hurricane (which absolutely will happen).\n\nIMO many people don't prep because many preppers come off as crazy.",

        "&gt; True racism is being racist for reasons that are actually true.\n\nClose. \n\n\nTrue racism is based on a fairy tail called \"race\" and was (is still) defined in our Constitutional Supreme and other court rulings historically as a way to define the difference between someone who was fully human and someone who was only part human. It's a disgusting idea. But you should check it out to know the truth of it.\n\nThe emphasis in the word race, is on what a person is, that can not be changed. Since you can not change the way you were born... what you are, racism was deemed illegal in many ways/laws too numerous to mention our post here.\n\nBack then, at the writing of our Constitution, layman identified skin color as the most obvious way to tell the difference between Constitutionally fully human and not. See the Constitution for verification of what I am pointing to. Cringy, but real history there that should not be hidden.\n\n\n\nThen, consider this new information: \n\nNow, science has proven that all skin is one color, because there is only one molecule that makes skin color. \n\n\nThat molecule is melanin.\n\n\n Period. \n\nEveryone on the planet is of the \"melanin\" race.\n\n So...... There goes that globalist.....\"divide and conquer\" tool.\nWhat to do. \nWhat to DO!!!! \n(cant have everyone understanding there is no such thing as race... that it's all a lie we made up to justify slave ownership..... can we) (and by the way, only 6% of white people could afford slaves. 60%, according to records came over \"as slaves\" in exchange for rich people paying their ticket over.They were called indentured slaves. They were under slave contract, usually seven years.) \n\nEvery seven years or so, the rich either had to order over some new indentured slaves, or get the expensive African slaves that could be owed for life. This is how slavery was ended. Too many poor white people escaped the plantation. None of them could be lied to about what went on at the plantation, and none of them were going to tolerate it. Could you sleep if you knew what was happening to your best friends at the plantation you just left? Or would you have a severe case of PTST and be talking to your church members about it on Sunday?\n\n It was just a matter of time. \n\nWhen the indentured cotton pickers reached 60% of the white population, the antislavery movement among white Christian slave descendants found it's voice and had the numbers to push slavery out the door . My great great grandmother was one of these. She ran the underground railroad up on lake Erie. She started it to save her best childhood friend, who was a fellow slave, and African.\nAnyway, I digress..... sorry.\n\nWhat is happening to the word \"race\"?\n\n\nWhat they (the globalists) decided to do (since they write the school textbooks we all learn from), is slowly change the definition of race and racism to a mix of nation, region, and culture. \n\nObserve:\n\nTechnically, China is a nation not a race. \n\nAsia is a region where melanin amounts in the skin are genetically similar, as are some other genetic traits. China is part of Asia. But not all of Asia is China. Asia is a region. During WWII I could hate on Germans during the war. Today, If I am angry at certain Mexicans and South Americans for invading my country, I am \"racist\" even though Mexico is a nation, not a race, and South America is a large continent.\n\n And .... what you are talking about here...\n\n\"Disliking them because Chinese society values the individual human life much less than other societies due to overpopulation and the lack of any sort of good Samaritan laws in china\"\n\n\n........ as you so eloquently put it, is in fact a cultural-ism. You are speaking to their cultural behaviors.\n\nWhere you and I would disagree,  only because of our age and education I am guessing, is that I have been taught that culture is a thing that can properly be discriminated against because it is, as I say, action based. For instance, I hate slave culture of every kind in every nation. Slave owning is a behavior. It is illegal in the United States because it is an action.\n\n All law properly discriminates against behavior or action.\n\nRace  was and is properly in the law... something you ARE that you can not change, which is why racism - - discrimination against a person because of what they ARE,  is outlawed. \n\nYou are born with certain genetics that can not be changed, and frankly, your looks cant harm anyone around you so WHAT you are is not a threat to humanity or your civilization.\n\n Culture, what you value, what you DO, how you ACT, is different. \n\nIt is not what you ARE. \n\nIt is behavior, what a person or civilization DOES.\n \nThe fact is, the law is always deciding to discriminate based on what people DO, or on activities. \n\nThat is the whole purpose of the law.\n\n\nDo you run stop signs?\n\n\n Deal drugs?\n\n\n Value life less than other cultures?\n\nDo you encourage the drowning of all of your girl infants by government policy?\n\nChina did, ever since Communism started. Now, there are millions of Chines men with no chance to raise a family. Their wife died as an infant in a river somewhere shortly after birth.\n\nGood for China? No?\n\n\nAll of these are actions that can and should be discriminated upon but not necessarily against.\n\n The idea is to find the best course of action and build the best culture and traditions for you civilization to have the best chance of survival.\n\n For example, that would mean you want to discriminate against the ACT of pedophilia, for instance, to keep the next generation healthy, and protect them as children. \n\n\nFact is, some people act much worse than others. \n\nWhat people DO can in fact damage a civilization.\n\n\n So, discriminating against harmful action, (Drunk driving for instance) and discouraging harmful cultural values,.... is the proper place for discrimination.... legally, morally, internationally, and even when it comes to personal relationships, if you value your life. \n\nSome people like to do murder, for instance.\n\n I highly advise staying away from Jack the Ripper, no matter what color he is, or even if he was really a she. \n\n\nNot a good idea for your health and well being to hang around someone that you should absolutely discriminate against based on his lifestyle, belief system, and natural tendencies.\n\nYou get my drift on this, right?\n\n\n What makes this much easier for everyone is if everyone understands the original legal meaning of the word race. It was not something you could change. It was something each person was BORN. \n\nOnce you get the idea that what a person IS, is sacred, and what a person DOES can be judged to hell and back, the whole issue gets a lot less cloudy.\n\nThe attempt to destroy the legal meaning of the word race in our recent social and history books has all the law schools discussing the possibility of eliminating the word race from all future court cases right now. \n\nInteresting discussion that younger people should be aware of.\n\n\n Interesting study in a case of attempting to rewrite history... at the moment.\n\nSpez spelling",

        "I want to be the mayor here but there's zero chance it would ever happen. NYS... they gave our convention center away to the Seneca nation so they could open a casino. So we gave away our convention center, taking that off the tax rolls, so a sovereign nation could open up a casino that pays no taxes right in the middle of our downtown. Our leaders didn't have the foresight to realize that they may also open up a few steakhouses and restaurants... and so since the casino was opened, we've had something like 40 restaurants close down. And all their business went to a casino that pays no taxes. \n\nThen they built a hotel. Our city has a law that structures can't be built higher than X, because they don't want a new building to be able to screw an existing one over and build right in its sightline of the falls. This hotel didn't have to follow any CoNF/NYS laws and they built a hotel that's like 5 times larger than anything else around here. They also don't have a bed tax. So now we don't have any restaurants or hotels paying taxes because they all shut down (the restaurants did, but there's still plenty of hotels. The most recent one that was built, we had a special parcel of land that we've been saving. It was at least a parking lot whose money went to the city. A shady developer came through and said he was gonna build the Taj Mahal. He got state funding, city tax breaks, and slowly the plans got cut. First it wasn't gonna be a luxury hotel, then it was gonna be a Radisson (or whatever). Now we have a fucking Best Western next to the Falls. Go look at Google maps street view. Look at the casino and simply *cross the one street* going north. It looks like Somalia. Literally across one street from the casino. This thing pays no taxes to the city. They used to, but our leaders forgot to put in any provisions for after 15 years. \n\nWe also generate most of the electricity for the eastern seaboard. Remember that massive blackout a year or 2 after 9/11? Everyone was flipping out because we thought it might be terrorists? That was because one transformer around here shit the bed. We gave that away, all the electricity we generate. NYS came rolling in and we signed away our hydroelectric rights for like 50 years. Not a 5 year contract. Not year by year. FIFTY FUCKING YEARS. Now we pay some of the highest electric rates in the country, in a city that Tesla wanted to power the world with... because they built us a park one time 10 years ago. We gave away infinite hydroelectric for a a park with a swingset. \n\nIt's so absurd. Just Google any of this. It's so absurd. And then even though the Power Authority had half a billion dollars in surplus... did they give us any of it back? No. They sent it to NYC to subsidize the transit prices. Half a billion dollars. And they just gave it to NYC subway riders. It's like having a massive field of apple trees, the best apples that anybody's ever tasted... and you ship them out for almost nothing, then pay to have some garbage red delicious apples shipped in, bruised and infested with worms (I stole this analogy from a local paper).\n\nWe have the falls right there. Lake Erie to one side and Lake Ontario to the other... but someone living in Arizona pays less for water. It's SUCH A JOKE. It's beyond unbelievable. You wouldn't believe there was a community of people so stupid. We deserve every shit thing that gets heaped on us. NYS built a parkway specifically to take people from the thruway, drive around the City of Niagara Falls, go right into the park (NF state park), and never set foot in our city. And we're just fine with that. \n\nI'd never be able to be mayor because I'm not corrupt enough, but whoever our mayor is needs to barricade the thruway, needs to build customs booths around the casino (they want to be a sovereign nation, that's fine. But you're gonna pass through customs leaving the City of NF and reentering. You're gonna pay taxes on anything you bought from there. And you're gonna take a breathalyzer. Let's see how many people decide to go to the black hole of a casino that was plopped in the middle of our city). I don't care if it's legal, they need to make a statement. Get thrown in jail to bring this shot to the national media. \n\nIt is beyond fucked around here. 60% of residents are in some kind of public assistance, and I honestly think I may be low with that number. We have the falls right there... I can walk out my door and be standing next to them in under 20 mins... and our main industry is shipping in people on welfare from NYC since the price of housing is so cheap, and having them sell painkillers",

        "I've lived in NE Ohio all my life, Akron Suburbs/Northern Summit County specifically, and absolutely love Ohio. My ancestors were one of the founding families of my city, so that's cool but doesn't really affect you. Lake Erie and some of the smaller lakes are huge draws for watersports and fishing, and our rivers and forests are truly spectacular. Northeast Ohio has some world class breweries and we're seeing an explosion of craft breweries popping up all the time. If you like beer, you're set. If you prefer wine, we have vinyards and breweries all over as well. Roller Coaster capital of the world, Cedar Point, is \\~90 mins away on the turnpike. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBest places to avoid? Lower Akron, most of the small towns away from the highways like New Franklin or Streetsboro. It's really more just use your common sense. If it looks sketchy, stay away. Honestly, most Ohioans really live up to the \"super friendly\" stereotype the east coast has of the Midwest. And stay away from most urban gas stations from like 1am-5am. Meth and Heroin are big problems all over the state.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn summer we do get stretches of Hot/Humid weather, but overall it's not too bad. Those 90 degree days are great times to go check out the lakes or go to friends house with a pool. Winters vary from mildly cold, wet and, muddy to cold and apocalypticly snowy to frigid but mostly dry. Or all 3. In the same day. And it'll be 80 the following day. We usually have at least one day a year where the temperature never rises above 0. Most of winter is spent in the 20s. According to Wikipedia, our climate is best described as \"typically has very warm, humid summers and cold, snowy winters, with moderate and variable spring and autumn seasons.\" Many parts of NE Ohio are in a snowbelt where cold air moving south or southeast from Canada picks up heat and moisture from a warm Lake Erie then rapidly deposits that moisture as snow over land. Even areas outside the snowbelt can pick up 6+ inches of snow from on a productive lake-effect day. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's a growing biomedical corridor with jobs in the medical and tech industries that stretches from Cleveland down through Akron and into North Canton. Because of this, our economy is healthy and appears to be growing in most sectors. Coming here with an academic background, we have 3 major Universities, (University of Akron, Kent State, and Cleveland State) with several smaller private schools and multiple county colleges/technical schools. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPolitically, the urban centers here (Cleveland, Akron, Columbus, Toledo) are strongly liberal. The suburbs tend to be a mix of liberal and conservative voters. Get out of the suburbs and you're in Trump nation. Most of the conservatives I know in the suburbs are not trump supporters, or at least regret having voted for him. Our local politics are very rarely tied to national politics so it's not uncommon to have wildly popular republican mayors, councilmen, auditors, etc in otherwise democratic voting areas. Outside of trump supporters, it's been my experience that most Ohioans are willing to discuss political issues with each other and disagree and specifics while remaining respectful towards each other. Generally so long as you stick to the Cities or the Suburbs I think you'd feel quite at home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYes, you've heard right. The cost of living is much cheaper out here. I live in a 4 bedroom 2 bathroom house with a large kitchen, 2 living rooms, an attached 2 car garage and finished basement, on an acre of land and I pay the bank $1200 a month. You can rent a house in a decent neighborhood in the suburbs for like $700 for 1000 sqr ft. A 2 bedroom 1.5 bath 1200 sqr ft in a new building in downtown Akron would run you \\~1300, downtown Cleveland you'd be looking at 1200-3400 depending on whether or not you're looking for waterfront and how new a building, for the same rooms and space.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs others have noted the Cuyahoga Valley is truly an amazing place, but you'll find that there's lots of green everywhere; Ohio has lots of space. There's golf courses and parks and lakes everywhere. Even in our cities there's parks and riverfronts within a a couple blocks of you at all times. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain, as others have noted you'll want a car. The Summit and Cuyahoga metroparks (Which includes the Cuyahoga Valley) both have extensive hike and bike trails that are interconnected. It's possible (though not recomended) to bike from Lock 3 in Akron to Edgewater Park on the shore of Lake Erie in Cleveland entirely on park trails. (Granted some trails do include marked sections on public roads, but not much)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBest time to visit? Anytime from now through the end of October. Fall is gorgeous here, and it's harvest season, so lots of great local produce to sample. ",

        "Alright you ready Freddy?\n\nSo here's the situation: I've currently sold my property in state A and buying property in state C. Now, the purchase was delayed so in the interim I was staying with people in state B. Over a holiday weekend, I was off in a fourth, irrelevant state other than I was on a boat and someone dropped a several hundred pound cooler on me when I was helping bring it up from belowdecks and someone in the tie-up bumped our boat rather hard and my leg went through the stairs. So this was a Saturday that I dislocated my knee, popped it back in on my own, and then spent the remainder of the day partying out in the middle of Lake Erie. \n\nSunday morning, I get up in excruciating pain. My knee is completely immobile and the size of a goddamn canteloupe / soccerball. I had to drive 8 hours back to state B to be back by Monday. Now, on my way home, I stop by the local bar, about 1.5 miles from the farm. I had a pint of Pabst while shooting the shit for 10-15 minutes, and then a double shot of Jack right before I left. I traveled about an 1/8th of a mile down the road, and then turned onto a frontage / rural road. It is a mile to my house down an unmarked, *gravel* fucking road and I will pass a total of 2 residences (farms). It was about 9pm in the middle of summer, so still a little light but after sundown. Suddenly, 100 yards from my house, dasblinkenlighten come on behind me. I honest to god have no idea where this cop car popped out of because I never saw him behind me. Mind you, I am in state B and have tags from state A.\n\nSo I pull over and this cop is giving me the nth degree. Asks me where I'm going (home / family), asks me why I'm sweating (1980s vehicle with t-tops and also hot as shit out), tells me I'm acting suspicious and need to exit the vehicle. So my knee, was in so much pain, I could not support ANY sort of weight that was not directly down (basically nothing that would cause a muscle to pull on a tendon or ligament in my knee). This requires me pulling myself up and out of the car via the t-top frame, while sweating even more profusely and having my eyes water from the pain. Now, this cop starts making comments about how I'm \"so unbelievably fucked up I can't even stand up straight,\" that, \"I'm so high there's no 'whites' left in my eyes (suggesting they're all red)\". I start getting irritated at this point and ask to know why I got stopped.\n\n\"Well you were weaving in and out your lane and crossing the centerline\"\n\nALLMYFUCKINGWAT.JPG  \nThere is no centerline, it's barely a 2-car wide road let alone 2 lanes. It's a DIRT FUCKING ROAD. So understandably, I laugh him off and say, \"No seriously. You almost had me there.\" Well now, now I'm apparently so intoxicated blah blah blah. Cop starts going on. So I tell him, I'm not fucking high, or drunk or anything. I'm fucking ~200 yards from home and I'd really like to be able to get weight off my knee and ice it.\n\nSo now this cop is demanding I do FSTs. Sure ok, what do you want me to do? (Remember, I have a freshly destroyed knee I can't even stand on)\n\n* First up, I'm demanded to do the **one-leg stand**. Not only can I not support weight on that leg, there is no way in hell I am going to be able to lift it the *24* inches he claims is required. I tried. I could only lift my leg out a few inches, and the cop decides to put his boot under my shoe and pull it forward. I was on the ground screaming in pain instantly. I've had some serious injuries and this was legitimately higher on the pain scale than being shot (in my other knee, another story for another day). It takes me about 5 minutes before the pain subsides enough for me to try and get back up. The cop then demands I get up without the assistance of my car because, \"a sober person wouldn't need to be leaning and falling all over a car to stand up straight.\" Couldn't do it, so I used the car. At this point, I am now sweating profusely from the pain, eyes are pouring tears, and the blood pressure in my ear is now a noticeable noise.\n\n* Second up, walk and turn. 9 steps there, 9 steps back. \"Ok,\" I think to myself. I can maybe do this. Except I get to the 9th step and turn (more like a shuffle) and this cop tells me it doesn't count, I need to turn in the style of an [about face](https://youtu.be/-bGvnMxPyJY?t=6s). BAHAHA no. No, I'm not even trying. No fucking way in hell I can put that sort of twisting strain on my knee. So I decline, walk my 9, arduous steps back, and once again lean on the car.\n\n* Third up was some bullshit I never even heard of. At this point I'm asking why this cop won't let me do any of the NHSTA-approved tests that do not involve my knees (alphabets, numbers, finger to nose, Romburg). Apparently anyone can do those, so I need to do his half-baked scheme. So at this point I start demanding, \"just give me a breathalyzer, I'm not fucking drunk.\" Because I had also just realized, the more I stand here and dick around, the closer that double shot is gonna put me, and I could have been home half an hour ago at this point.\n\nSo I get a breathalyzer. And I blow a .067, twice. So what happens? Oh, well, obviously *I must be all fucked up on something else*. It couldn't POSSIBLY be that I couldn't stand on my own because my knee was bigger than this fucking cop's head. So now, I get cuffed and stuffed into the back of a squad to get taken to the hospital for a blood draw. Draw gets done, family comes and picks me up, yadda yadda.\n\nTurned out my blood came back as .073, so still in the clear.\n\nSo now, I'm trying to fight this shit right. I was legally under the limit, the cop offered up no other \"proof\" of intoxication. Well here's were shit really gets real. Apparently, driving injured - injured in such a way I could not do those FSTs - qualified as Operating while intoxicated. Well golly gee willikers, better not ever stub your fucking toe again you inconsiderate drunk driver.\n\nSo remember, I have (actually *had* but did not know at this point) a license from state A. State B convicts me of OWI first. It's only a moving violation. 6 month revocation and an alcohol assessment. Aight no biggie, whatever. Prosecutor also tells me that since my license is *not* from state B, that as long as I made it out of the state on my way to state C, I'd be fine. Because they can't take my license, only revoke my *privilege* in their state.\n\nSo I get down to state C, and they tell me they can't issue me a license because 1. I *don't have a license* and 2. I have an outstanding revocation in state B.\n\nHOLD UP! What the fuck do they mean I \"don't have a license\"? Well, when I was in state B I forwarded my mail. Apparently, the DMV in state A decided that *forwarding my mail out of state* counted as \"notifying them of a change of residence to an out of state address\". Wherein they then canceled my license after 30 days. WELL THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN FUCKING NICE TO KNOW.\n\nSo whatever. My 6 months are up, I did my classes, only drove a dozen times - to my classes. Go back to the DMV after state B says I've been reinstated and no longer am revoked. Hunky-dory eh?\n\n**WRONG MOTHERFUCKER**\n\n\"You have an outstanding revocation\" - What? Where?... \"State A\". But... wait... they canceled my license (and before I was convicted of the OWI).\n\nState A's response - OH, well you got *charged* with the OWI on our license. So now, at this point I'm arguing this is double jeopardy. I'm being punished twice for the same offense. Furthermore, I wanted to know why I had not been notified either time (revocation or cancellation) as state A requires CMRR-IDR (Certified Mail Return Receipt - Identified Recipient). Essentially, you have to sign for the letter and verify your ID and no one else can sign for you. THEY DROPPED THE BALL ON THAT TWICE. There was also a little known bit of law in that state protecting you. If you were not ordered to surrender in court, sent service (basically the police serve you the surrender order), or received that letter, then your license couldn't be taken/suspended/revoked and you couldn't be punished for it.\n\n**[BUT WAIT! THERE'S MORE!](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/828/732/83f.jpg)**\n\nSo I get a letter from State A saying 1 year and I have to do the Alcohol/Substance Abuse classes. In state A, you have to do them, *in your county of residency*. Well shit, according to them, they decided I *was no longer a fucking resident 9 months ago*. So what county do I do it in? The response I got from the DMV? \"You will be contacted by your county of residency as our system automatically enrolls you in your county's program.\" (In state A, the classes are run by the county gov't, there is no 3rd party like state B or C or many other states).\n\nWell, after a month of arguing, petitioning, and murderously high blood pressure, state A's DMV, and state B's prosecutor have come to a *written and notarized agreement*. State B will ~~rescind~~ (I'm sorry, this is what they actually did, the original agreement was) *re-open* the charges, give me 30 days to get a license in State C, and then re-enter the charges.  State C was ok with this. State A also, ON A SIGNED FUCKING DOCUMENT, verified that as I would be holding a license in a state that was not state A, that *they would have nothing to do with it*, thereby relieving me of their revocation and ASA requirements. Also, agreed to on the fact that I had served a revocation and done classes accepted by another state's DMV.\n\nOh you sweet, sweet summer child. \n\nI gotta get to bed. Tomorrow morning I'll hit you up with the rest. Also, at the 10k limit almost for a comment anyways.",

        "Good question. Off the top of my head, I can think of a multitude of reasons:\n\nNote that the canal was constructed in 1817-1825, so take into account the technology and history of that time.\n\nThe purpose of the Erie Canal was to improve access of the burgeoning American Midwestern grain and agriculture production with the booming population and trade/port access at New York City. \n\nYou can't sail through the Niagara River to Lake Erie: [there's a slight hazard there.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/Niagara_Falls_USA_Canada_from_Skylon_Tower_on_2002-05-28.png/1024px-Niagara_Falls_USA_Canada_from_Skylon_Tower_on_2002-05-28.png) Ending the canal at Lake Ontario would mean another canal would have to be built. Where would you put it? \n\nCutting through the [Niagara Peninsula](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/NiagaraPeninsulaLocator.png) is on Canadian land and would probably be under British jurisdiction.  As you can imagine, that was not in the best interests and desires of the USA for sovereignty reasons (and the War of 1812 was still likely a vivid memory). [The Welland Canal](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Map_of_the_Welland_Canal.png/666px-Map_of_the_Welland_Canal.png) was eventually constructed and enlarged, which allowed larger freighters to bypass the Erie Canal entirely and go through the St. Lawrence.  Much more feasible with  later tech than 1820s tech. This ultimately led to economic devastation of [Buffalo's former booming grain storage and agricultural transport industry.](https://www.historicalmarkerproject.com/markers/HM1LU2_the-grain-industry-decline-buffalos-grain-legacy_Buffalo-NY.html) \n\nOr you could dig the second canal through the Western tip of New York over/through the [Niagara Escarpment](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Niagara_Escarpment_map.png/640px-Niagara_Escarpment_map.png). It poses sheer challenges that would be more difficult than with the canal's gradual ascent and descent (and avoidance of the escarpment) across its chosen path. \n\nFor either of the two alternate choices above, it is highly likely that the cargo on the boats would have to be moved between 2 or more boats to traverse safely on the big lake [\\(Lake Ontario\\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mp2ioxDKjvE) yet still be able to pass through a canal. \n\nCanal boats were built with very [shallow bottoms, very long lengths, and very thin widths](http://www.eriecanal.org/boats.html) in order to pass through the shallow and narrow canal. Using the same boats to travel in the much harsher waters Lake Ontario would almost certainly be devastating in many instances. If they were to switch boats 2-3 times and/or have to wait due to rough waters, that would certainly make the transport between NYC and the Midwest much slower. \n\nAnother reasons was that other towns in NY wanted access and to enhance their growing commerce throughout that area. Rochester was actually also a booming city and nicknamed [\"The Flour City\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochester,_New_York) during that time. It was actually arguably [America's first  boomtown](https://books.google.com/books/about/America_s_First_Boomtown_Rochester_NY.html?id=QZO8LAAACAAJ). Knowing that, it makes little sense to bypass it (and the other cities in NY with similar surpluses, as the other commenter mentioned). \n\n\n",

        "Here you go. Sorry for the poor formatting. On mobile.\n.\n\nBuffalo seeing economic gains from Great Lakes restoration efforts\nBy\tT.J. Pignataro | Published September 25, 2018 | Updated September 25, 2018\n \n \nThere's a payoff to cleaning up the Great Lakes, and in Buffalo it's higher than most other places.\n\nA University of Michigan study released Tuesday found that for every dollar the U.S. government spends on restoring Lake Erie, Lake Ontario and other water bodies, the Buffalo area could see more than $4 of additional economic gain through the next couple of decades.\n\nOnly Detroit and part of the Chicago metropolitan area had higher potential payoffs.\n\nThe economic benefits come not just from the cleanup work but on the tourism, recreation and waterfront development that follows.\n\nFor Buffalo, the report cited real estate and commercial development at RiverWorks, Canalside and the Ohio Street corridor housing complexes as examples of the spinoff economic benefits of the federal funding.\n\n\n\u201cIt confirms what we\u2019ve known for a long time, which is you can\u2019t build a waterfront on a polluted waterway,\u201d said Rep. Brian Higgins, a proponent of the program and waterfront restoration and development. \u201cThat would never have occurred without the effort to clean up the waterway.\u201d\n\nThe University of Michigan economists studied the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, a federal program initiated during the Bush administration and launched during the Obama administration.\n\nThe program provided funds to help restore the Buffalo River, launch fish and wildlife initiatives in Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, and reduce harmful algal blooms, invasive species and water pollution.\n\nThe researchers estimated the local multiplier effect \u2013 the increase in monies generated from an initial investment \u2013 will be $4.09 in economic benefit for every $1 put toward environmental restoration between 2010 and 2036. Detroit\u2019s multiplier effect was estimated to be $4.29. Waukegan, Ill., located 35 miles north of downtown Chicago, had an even higher multiplier: $4.33.\n\n\"The 4-to-1 return on the GLRI investment demonstrated in Buffalo is much larger than a traditional economic development project,\" said Jill Jedlicka, executive director of Buffalo Niagara Waterkeeper. \"And, it supports Waterkeeper's 'Rust-to-Blue' theory that investments in the health of our natural systems and quality of life are investments in the health of our regional economy.\"\n\nOverall, economists found that for every dollar the federal government invested in Great Lakes Restoration Initiative programs between 2010 and 2016 produced an average of $3.35 in additional economic activity in the Great Lakes, and it is expected to continue through 2036.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing the impacts now,\u201d said Gabriel Ehrlich, a University of Michigan researcher on the study\u2019s project team.\n\nMultiplier effect\n\nFor every dollar spent in the federal Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, this is how much the economic output is expected to be between 2010 and 2036.\n\nWaukegan, Ill.\nSheboygan, Wis.\nMuskegon, Mich.\nErie, Pa.\nDuluth, Minn.\nDetroit, Mich.\nBuffalo, NY\nAshtabula, Ohio\n4.33\n2.63\n3.03\n3.43\n2.8\n4.29\n4.09\n2.75\n4.33\n\n\nThe Buffalo News \u00bb Source: University of Michigan Research Seminar in Quantitative Economics\nDATA\u00d7\nRegion\tMultiplier\nAshtabula, Ohio\t2.75\nBuffalo, NY\t4.09\nDetroit, Mich.\t4.29\nDuluth, Minn.\t2.80\nErie, Pa.\t3.43\nMuskegon, Mich.\t3.03\nSheboygan, Wis.\t2.63\nWaukegan, Ill.\t4.33\n\n\nMULTIPLIER EFFECTDOWNLOAD CSV\nSo far, about $2.9 billion of federal restoration funds have been spent in the Great Lakes across 4,000 projects.\n\nThe projects include:\n\nCleaning up toxic hot spots, including legacy industrial sites like the Buffalo River\nStopping invasive species from getting into the Great Lakes and controlling those that are here\nEliminating water pollution and nutrient loading from phosphorus that generate harmful algal blooms\nRestoring diverse, native habitats, some of which included the Buffalo River and Buffalo Harbor\n\u201cThis study moves our understanding of the impacts of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative from anecdotal to comprehensive,\u201d Mike Shriberg, executive director of the National Wildlife Federation\u2019s Great Lakes Regional Center. \u201cThe GLRI is not only stimulating regional economies, but is also transforming waterfronts and generating community pride.\u201d\n\n\nOther cities in the study include: Erie, Pa.; Ashtabula, Ohio; Muskegon, Mich.; Sheboygan, Wis.; Duluth, Minn.; and Superior, Wis.\n\n\u201cThis program has proven to be critical to broaden economic development goals,\u201d Alesha Washington, director of the Great Lakes Metro Chambers Coalition, said during a morning conference call among economists and reporters.\n\nThe study found that developers, local residents and tourists are all using Buffalo\u2019s waterfront for recreation. It noted that 89 new apartments have been added.\n\n\nThe building at 301 Ohio St. is one of the projects highlighted by the economists' study. (Derek Gee/News file photo)\n\nAnd, the study pointed out Buffalo\u2019s \u201cten-fold increase\u201d in waterfront events in 2016 that drew more than 1.5 million people downtown.\n\nThe study found millennials are attracted to Buffalo.\n\n\u201cBuffalo\u2019s millennial population has increased by 12 percent \u2013 five percent more than the rest of the state of New York,\u201d the study said.\n\nThat\u2019s one of the statistics that resonated with Higgins.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first time in 40 years, Buffalo\u2019s young population is going up, not going down,\u201d Higgins said.\n\nThe ambitious plans for the waterfront \u2013 and their rapid execution \u2013 shocked even some the region\u2019s most optimistic people.\n\n\nBuffalo Niagara Waterkeeper\u2019s Jedlicka remembers the announcement by Buffalo RiverWorks.\n\n\u201cEven seven years ago, I remember walking the site and thinking they were crazy,\u201d Jedlicka told the study's authors. \u201cBasically, what they had told us at that time is because we had started to get this river cleanup underway on the Buffalo River, it gave them the confidence to start to invest early with their private resources.\u201d\n\nThat energy has spread up and down the Buffalo River, from Canalside to the Old First Ward and into the Valley.\n\nHiggins cited the development of a $30 million hotel at the former Donovan state office building and the $220 million development of Buffalo HarborCenter.\n\nThere\u2019s Tewksbury Lodge on Ohio Street, the Buffalo River Landing and the Cooperage, an Ellicott Development project underway in the former E. &amp; B. Holmes Machinery Company on Chicago Street.\n\n\nThe study found the restoration has spurred development, tourism and increased land values in spots that were once depressed.\n\nIt also provided hard data for local organizations like Visit Buffalo Niagara.\n\n\u201cWe know a more vibrant waterfront is contributing to the enhancement of the Buffalo brand, and its appeal as a destination,\u201d said Edward J. Healy, vice president of marketing for Visit Buffalo Niagara. \u201cVirtually every major article about Buffalo by visiting travel writers in recent years has mentioned either Canalside, RiverWorks, Silo City or the Outer Harbor, and the activities found in these waterfront hot spots.\u201d\n\nHealy added: \u201cThere is probably no more potent symbol of the \u2018New Buffalo\u2019 and the city\u2019s regeneration than the frenzy of activity on and around the waterfront.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nA linear park is in the works by the Western New York Land Conservancy and its partners to connect Canalside with SolarCity.\n\nIt\u2019ll be modeled after New York City\u2019s High Line.\n\nHiggins also pointed to a proposed system of bicycle and pedestrian trails with funding from the Ralph C. Wilson, Jr. Foundation that could connect Canalside with the Old First Ward and the Outer Harbor.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just getting warmed up,\u201d Higgins said. \u201cI see the next five years changing Buffalo for the next 100 years.\u201d\n\nLeaders hope the report serves as clear and convincing evidence why Great Lakes restoration needs to continue.\n\nThe initiative is in its second four-year phase, which runs through 2019. But, the $300 million annual appropriation has found itself near the chopping block of federal budgets over the last couple of years.\n\nSo far, there\u2019s been enough congressional support to ward off elimination.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a bipartisan effort,\u201d Higgins said. \u201cIt\u2019s more regional than ideological.\u201d\n\nLast year, when fears arose of cuts by the Trump administration, Republican Rep. Chris Collins declared that program would and should remain in force. He reaffirmed that Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe University of Michigan study is further proof that the Great Lakes are a vital economic and environmental asset for Western New York,\u201d Collins said. \u201cAnd, protecting the Great Lakes will continue to be a key priority of mine.\u201d",

Because that's even more important.\n\n\n&gt; You won't find me or most progressive folks disagreeing.\n\n\nMaybe not from the grassroots, but when is the last time you saw an elected Democrat push for it? All talk, no action. In Maine, the Democrats had to be fought and their veto overridden for RCV to pass. They are no allies of electoral reform - and for good reason. It threatens their power.\n\n\n&gt; But until it's more widely implemented voting for the Green party is essentially voting for Trump in 2020.\n\n\nUtter nonsense. When I vote in 2020, my ballot will look like this (assuming the nominees for the sake of discussion):\n\n\nD | Biden | 0\n\n\n\nR | Trump | 0\n\n\n\nL | Kokesh | 0\n\n\n\nG | Hawkins | 1\n\n\nNotice how Trump has 0 votes.\n\n\nIn NO WAY WHATSOEVER is my Green vote a vote for Trump. The basic arithmetic (we're talking 0s and 1s here) doesn't work that way.\n\n\n&gt; \"My party\" may not be perfect, but at least it's not actively fucking over all future generations, which I consider the Green party to be doing.\n\n\nYou seem to be completely naive to what the Democratic Party AND the Green Party are doing, and the impact their actions are having on the world. For example, let's look at some of the things both parties have done so far in 2019:\n\n\nDemocrats:\n\n\n- Blocked and/or voted down (an already watered-down) Green New Deal in the House and Senate.\n\n\n- Voted to expand natural gas exports across Europe\n\n\n- Supported coup in Venezuela\n\n\n- Voted for Trump's military budget\n\n\n- Voted to fund ICE\n\n\n- Proposed a bill that makes it nearly impossible for minor parties to qualify for presidential ballot access, and then championed it as democracy reform (HR.1)\n\n\nGreens:\n\n\n- Stood up to the coup in Venezuela by protecting the Venezuelan Embassy at the request of the legitimate Venezuelan government\n\n\n- Fought for and passed the Lake Erie Bill of Rights\n\n\n- Ensured that Pennsylvania will have paper ballots by 2020 and automatic election audits by 2022\n\n\n- Put their bodies on the line standing up to new pipeline infrastructure\n\n\n- Helped stop the private takeover of Ohio Schools\n\n\n- Organized a lobby day in DC over the climate crisis\n\n\n&gt; Vote your heart and ideals in the primaries\n\n\nI literally can't. Your party, along with the Republicans, passed legislation that bans me from doing so because I am a Green. That said - in our internal 2020 Green Primary, I absolutely will be voting my heart and ideals - which Howie Hawkins represents. Then I will be voting for him again in November. Or likely for whoever the Green nominee is, if Howie doesn't win our nomination.\n\n\n&gt; but fucking fall in line in the the general unless you support Trump, because lord knows Republicans will.\n\n\n1. I will not \"fall in line\" behind a candidate and a party that doesn't represent my values. That is not Democracy, that is coercion.\n\n\n2. There will more options than \"Democrat or Trump\" on the ballot in 2020, and as an active volunteer on a Green Presidential Campaign, I will personally make sure of it by petitioning to help gather the thousands of signatures we will need in Pennsylvania to qualify.\n\n\n3. The Libertarian Party is a party of the right and they are *bigger* than the Greens. This idea that the right falls in line and the left splinters is nonsense. Your categorization of the right as just \"Republicans\" is also problematic. Let me be clear: Libertarians are not Republicans just as Greens are not Democrats. We are an independent political party with our own platform, our own candidates, and our own vision for the country.\n\n\nBonus: The recent local elections in The U.K, and provincial elections in Prince Edward Island are definitive proof that Greens can win even under first past the post. The election of Paul Manly to the national Canadian Parliament a few weeks ago is too. Our victory is not only possible, it it inevitable, if enough people join the cause and work for it - and we don't need to wait for electoral reform to do that. We can overcome no matter what!\n\n\nwww.gp.org\n\n\nwww.HowieHawkins.us\n\n\nwww.gpofpa.org\n\n\nwww.montcogreens.com",

(You also get diminishing returns on the resistance augmentation; consider changing one to thermal and one to heavy duty...)\n* Super conduits as an experimental effect on power distributors is almost always preferred to cluster capacitors, especially as, in this case, you're doing well on capacitor usage. \n* Consider switching to Mass Manager on your FSD instead of stripped down.  The weight savings doesn't materially impact the handling of your ship, but you'll get slightly more jump range. \n* You'll probably want to go with extra ammo for the heat sink. \n* Honestly - and there's some debate about this - I think you have enough hull.  I'd drop on of the hull reinforcements and get another module reinforcement.  If your shields go down, you'll be incredible susceptible to hull-piercing module damage, which will impact you far more than hull damage itself. \n* Go ahead and switch the engineering on those huge hardpoints over to \"overcharged\" from efficient.  You'll drain your capacitor faster, but your damage will increase dramatically. \n* I'd recommend, at a minimum, putting some experimental effect on the beam lasers.  Consider \"oversized\", which will increase your damage output. \n* Corrosive on the small multicannons doesn't stack, so having it on two guns doesn't make sense.  Take the second one and move it to \"autoloader\" or something like that. \n* You'll get more benefit (and cargo space) but using the class 6 optional as cargo and putting stuff in the class 3 and class 4.   You can do two hull reinforcements and get far more benefit. \n* Optionally, consider unlocking the Guardian Shield Reinforcements.  Great for every ship, and if you're looking for some hot PvE action, shields are the way to go. \n* Also, optionally, you really don't need that military grade hull for PvE work.  Seriously.  \n\nI took these recommendations and [here's your build with those changes.](https://coriolis.io/outfit/federal_corvette?code=A2putpFklkdzsuf57o7o0v0s0s2424020j040404040404B05sfh052d2dCem9m96l2b293x.Iw18ZVA%3D.Aw18ZVA%3D.H4sIAAAAAAAAA42TP2hTYRTFb%2F42%2F1%2Fea5K%2BtgmmzWsLHUodC4IgiDoIggodu7iIg4OVDjq4lCJOpZQODh0ci7i1g5RSpDiKgziICC4iBYuDg9Z7PSeYDxPUJpDDgfv7zndzvxvRARH5mYIcr0Lyd%2BMixeW8iF%2BHC3bgov2YiMX0LMk4yfuQzKeEiBcem9VuIcPiWnNJdyBe9N2scgipniuJhM%2BSIq3bQyATOuLIpQ7ZvqmyMgjyHSqW1NMdyFs6RH3vg5mldM4dfQDJFtQs99oTGaMbp5ugm6SztC50hzz9aDZz5huSMjrvkvCVJJtIzY%2BKpLeK6LTdRLYfKKdXHfQQktrIoL5wZBZufDFrNT%2Fjunw%2FUKEfqKjXHZRgU0ctNEYJON3wFR6jcQ%2FPYqU%2F4uRfcZ5OEGoncfpBeUqkTmdlvdE1vWEObrb9Dr5ecNGPuTZP0oCu%2FECFLnyRxdrQWdA3Oajnu0iP0w1mF39Dp95ii6yiF7vj%2BNg%2BJXqUQ716Qr12Qn1IL7v6TUicC57m7ubnMCP%2FPaTKTqLnXPpQLxFHWWJscmATI5p6g5%2FTvPYVcxrVaRe3zusi2NLLYSTRBZvY0ojO6r3kNslmHeS2I%2BmsoeW%2F%2FDOa2uh0UuA7BWwn5KmRNR%2Bnxnrzd13%2Brsuns%2FFe8sCRB46kM5P%2Ffn4BH2XfIlwEAAA%3D.EwegjAdArCzSAGcAWCBmWyQFMCGBzAG2xBDQQsSoSA%3D%3D&amp;bn=Leonov)  The hull is nearly as strong, shields are much, much stronger, and damage output has increased by about 20%.",

        "An Ion train travels along King Street West in Kitchener. The light rail transit system has changed the look of Kitchener and Waterloo, and will continue to reshape the community. - Mathew McCarthy , Waterloo Region Record \nOn Friday, Kitchener and Waterloo will join a growing list of more than 45 cities across North America that have light rail or streetcars. It is an important step in the growth of Waterloo Region that is setting us apart from other communities across Ontario. The construction cranes popping up along the LRT corridor are proof that even before the line has opened it is dramatically reshaping the look and feel of the region.\nTransportation has always been intertwined with how cities develop. One hundred years ago, the old streetcars dictated how virtually every city of more than 10,000 people grew, and how development took place.\nCities built at this time have an inherently walkable urban form. Streetcars were the main way of getting around, so houses, shops and factories needed to be close enough to streetcar stops so people could walk to them. This created a natural density. Streetcar routes focused on the downtown core, so a premium was put on real estate there. This led to the first skyscraper cities that emerged around transit hubs like downtown Chicago.\nHowever, after the Second World War, it was the car, and not transit, that became the dominant form of transport. Cities spread out, as driving replaced walking and transit. Big auto companies lobbied for more roads, and governments spent vast sums of money on new highways and comparatively little on transit. Big houses with wide lots, shopping malls and large office parks are all products of this car-oriented environment. As new suburbs grew, older urban neighbourhoods declined. Businesses moved to suburban shopping malls, and land around highway interchanges, not transit hubs, became the main centres of employment and retail.\n \nPrepare for long lines on Ion\u2019s first day\n\nFaced with antiquated trolleys, dwindling ridership and high operating costs, most transit companies opted to replace their streetcars with buses between the 1930s and 1960s. The last streetcar in Kitchener ran in 1946, replaced by an electric trolleybus that would continue running until 1973. Electric interurban trains running down to Lake Erie carried their last passengers in 1955.\nBy the mid-1970s only Toronto, Cleveland, Boston, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Newark and New Orleans had any sort of urban streetcar system left in North America. Even in Toronto, where the streetcars are a much-loved icon of the city, the TTC wanted to replace them all in the 1970s.\nThankfully, an activist group called Streetcars for Toronto campaigned to retain and modernize the system. Rather than being based around nostalgia, their argument centred on environmental factors and the simple fact that streetcars carry large numbers of people more efficiently than buses. The TTC reversed its decision and placed an order for new streetcars to replace its aging fleet. These vehicles served the city for 40 years and are now being replaced with the Bombardier-built trains that are very similar to the Ion fleet in Waterloo Region.\nBy the early 1980s, the fortunes of the streetcar were reversing. Rebranded as light rail transit, new systems opened in San Diego, Edmonton and Calgary. These cities opted for light rail because it was far cheaper to build than a subway.\nCompared with conventional streetcars, LRT vehicles are faster, as they utilize their own right-of-way, and carry more people because their trains are articulated and can be coupled together. They also require much less infrastructure than a subway and can be built into the existing urban fabric relatively easily.\nToday, LRTs are popular across North America, with successful systems now running in Minneapolis, Houston, Denver, Los Angeles and Seattle, to name but a few.\n\nWhy this return to urban rail transit? Reducing traffic congestion, improving commuting times and producing a cleaner environment are the driving factors of many LRT systems.\nPortland's highly successful LRT emerged out of the anti-freeway movement in the 1970s. The city cancelled a downtown highway project and used the funds to build an LRT line instead. Like Waterloo Region, Portland also has an urban growth boundary, which encourages intensification and transit oriented development. In another parallel, Portland also changed its bus network from an infrequent hub and spoke system, to a grid operating around the growing LRT network. Today, Portland is one of the most livable cities in the U.S. and a cultural hub of the Pacific Northwest.\nHowever, it is not just altruistic environmental goals that have led to a resurgence of urban rail transit. It is increasingly seen as a key driver of economic growth and development. This is particularly true of the wave of new American streetcar systems that have popped up since 2000.\nThis new generation of streetcars feature short lines that link downtown with one or two adjacent and usually trendy neighbourhoods. Unlike the Ion, they have neither their own lane, nor signal priority at intersections, and therefore tend to be very slow, often comparable with walking speed. \nThese new streetcars are about attracting investment, rather than riders. In some places, this has worked; Portland's streetcar (which complements the LRT) has seen 10,000 new houses along its short route and the new streetcar in Oklahoma City has attracted more than $1 billion in investment.\nIn other places, like Cincinnati, whose short streetcar loop carries only 1,500 people per day, the impact has been small. Combined, the dozen new streetcar systems opened between 2001 and 2017 carry about half as many people as the 84,000 who ride Toronto's 504 King streetcar each day.\nHow does the Ion fit into this picture of growing urban rail transit in North America? For starters, it is far more than just a downtown loop. It directly connects most of the main destinations in Waterloo Region: two large shopping centres, two universities, a major hospital and both downtown Kitchener and uptown Waterloo. That means it is likely to be very well used. Houston's first LRT line uses a similar principle and is one of the most successful in North America. When extended to Cambridge, Ion will connect with even more of the region's major destinations.\nA key objective of the LRT, however, is not to move people, but to shape future development patterns in the region. The politics of Waterloo Region is about striking a delicate balance between rapid urban growth (we are the second fastest growing urban area in Canada) and preserving the much-loved countryside around our cities.\nUntil recently, two-third's of new development in the region took place in open countryside, gobbling up productive farmland. The LRT, combined with the countryside line, are meant to reverse that trend, encouraging the majority of new growth to take place through intensification of the existing urban footprint, in areas such as former factory sites or on underutilized land such as parking lots.\nThe LRT is, first and foremost, a growth management tool. Seen from this perspective, it has already been tremendously successful. Even before a single passenger has been carried, there has been about $3 billion in new investment along the corridor.\nThe combination of long-term planning and a vision to dramatically reshape the nature of development across the region are a unique combination when compared to other LRT systems across North America. It will also make us a more sustainable region, with more people able to do more activities without relying on cars. For people who need to use cars, congestion should be eased.\nJust as the first generation of streetcars and the automobile did in previous eras, the Ion is set to shape the look and feel of Waterloo Region for decades to come. This will also make our region distinct from other cities in southern Ontario, and give us a density (and skyline) that won't be found in London, Windsor or St. Catharines.\nBut who will be able to live in these new skyscrapers that are popping up along the Ion corridor? What new challenges does the LRT bring to our community? In my next article Tuesday, I will critically examine the ways in which the trains are reshaping neighbourhoods along North America's newest LRT line and ask whether everyone will be able to enjoy the full benefits that these trains will bring.",

        "It sounds to me exactly as it's described. These were a group of Loyalists \"impressed\" (i.e. forced into service) into a Patriot militia regiment. They escaped, and with the help of another Loyalist, \"Col. Jones,\" who lent them a boat, they were able to immigrate to Nova Scotia in 1778.\n\nThe experience in early Canada was very much a pioneer life. 1778 is pretty early, too. Most Loyalists didn't go to Canada until 1783 or later, at the tail end of the war or even years after. Once there, it was probably what you'd expect. Most were farmers who cultivated the land. Being pioneers, they also had to clear it. The early years were spent developing infrastructure as well. They built themselves log cabins and, later, houses. They built mills, stores, churches, schools, and taverns. They began clearing roads and developing reliable transportation routes, including ferries and stagecoaches. They applied for land grants from the British government in repayment for their war service, and for the land they often lost in the United States. The British government provided some provisions to these \"United Empire Loyalists,\" including farm equipment, seeds, muskets, even glass for windows for their cabins. In the earliest days, they provided food rations, too. Though, a common complaint was that the British government was often slow to act on giving out land grants, and stingy with the provisions and rations.\n\nOne of the most trying events early on was a failed crop in 1787 due to an unseasonably cool summer in Canada. This led to the \"Hungry Year\" or \"Scarce Year\" from the winter of 1787 through the following summer, which wasn't really alleviated until the next year's autumn harvest. The son of one of the Loyalists in Ontario who lived through it [described what his parents had told him about it](https://books.google.com/books?id=PEgOAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA3-PA75):\n\n&gt; \"We had the luxury of a cow which the family brought with them, and had it not been for this domestic boon, all would have perished in the year of scarcity. The crops had failed the year before, and the winter that followed, was most inclement and severe. The snow was unusually deep, so that the deer became an easy prey to their rapacious enemies, the wolves, who fattened on their destruction, whilst men were perishing for want. Five individuals, in different places, were found dead, and one poor woman also, with a live infant at her breast; which was cared for and protected.\"\n\nA lot of Loyalists gave up and went back to the U.S. because of this, though many could not even if they wanted to, because they faced arrest/persecution for various actions they had taken during the war. \n\nHelpful early on were the First Nations living in the area, who the British colonists established trading relationships with, mutually aiding each other in survival during tough times. The Six Nations, part of the Iroquois Confederacy living in (what's now) New York state, were also forced out of the U.S. at the end of the war, and moved to Canada as well. The British colonists established trading relationships with them, too.\n\nThe experience got better over time, and by the time of the War of 1812, the Loyalist experience wasn't too far removed from living in the countryside in the United States. Halifax was on par with one of the smaller cities in the States, and Toronto (still called York) was on its way. Kingston wasn't too far off, either. Quebec city and Montreal had been well-established before the Loyalists arrived, but Loyalists didn't go there because that's not where the British government wanted them to go. The government were trying to get the rest of Canada settled so that they could protect their remaining North American presence, so the land grants they offered were anywhere from the Maritime Provinces all the way west to Windsor, across the river from Detroit, but few were in modern day Quebec (called \"Lower Canada\" at the time). The Loyalists were mainly placed in the Maritime provinces, or along the coast line of Lake Ontario and Lake Erie, or the northern banks of the St. Lawrence River west of where the French were occupied.\n\nFor a lengthier sketch than the above, you may want to try [*Loyalists, Pioneers and Settlers of the Maritimes: A Teacher's Resource*](http://www.uelac.org/education/MaritimesResource/Loyalists-Pioneers-Settlers-Maritimes.php) published by the United Empire Loyalists' Association of Canada and available on their website for free.\n\nThe most thorough resource you'll find on the pioneer Canadian experience is [*Early Life In Upper Canada*](https://books.google.com/books?id=APw2DwAAQBAJ) by Edwin C. Guillet. While it's ostensibly specific to Ontario (called \"Upper Canada\" at the time), a lot of the material applies to the Maritime colonies as well. I highly recommend seeking out a copy of this book if the subject interests you. It'll give you all the information you want, and more, on the early days of English-speaking Canada. Unfortunately, it's out of print, but you can usually find a used copy at a decent price (considering it's over 700 pages long) on Amazon or eBay. And of course, your library may have it, and if they don't, then you can probably get it free via interlibrary loan.\n\nMore specific to Nova Scotia is [*This Unfriendly Soil: The Loyalist Experience in Nova Scotia 1783-1791*](https://books.google.com/books?id=7fMY5N5z-MAC) by Neil MacKinnon. It's worth seeking out as a good resource to understand what happened to the Loyalists in that colony in the first decade after the war.\n\nAnother great resource is [*While The Women Only Wept: Loyalist Refugee Women in Eastern Ontario*](https://books.google.com/books?id=5u831yyx6XsC) by Janice Potter-MacKinnon. Again, while it's specific to Ontario, it gives some insight into the female experience and the pioneer experience in general in post-war Canada.\n\nPerhaps the most widely available resource is the recent broad overview told in [*Liberty's Exiles: American Loyalists in the Revolutionary World*](https://books.google.com/books?id=uGKsn09oVwQC) by Maya Jasanoff. This book tries to give the experience a more narrative view, by following the lives of a few specific Loyalists to their new refugee lives. It contains more than just the Canadian experience, but all the destinations that Loyalists immigrated to. However, a couple of the chapters do deal directly with immigration to Nova Scotia and the other Maritime colonies.\n\nA good public domain resource that includes quotes from several first-hand accounts is [*United Empire Loyalists: A Chronicle of the Great Migration*](https://archive.org/details/unitedempireloya00walluoft/page/n14) by W. Stewart Wallace, which has some material specific to the arrival of the Loyalists in Nova Scotia and the other Maritime provinces. A similar resource is [*Pioneer Life Among the Loyalists in Upper Canada*](https://archive.org/details/pioneerlifeamong00herrrich/page/n5) by W.S. Herrington.\n\nFor entirely first-hand accounts, you may want to read [\"The Diary of Sarah Frost, 1783\"](https://preserve.lib.unb.ca/wayback/20141205151334/http://atlanticportal.hil.unb.ca/acva/loyalistwomen/en/documents/frost/) (linked there on the page) and [\"The Narrative of Hannah Ingraham\"](https://preserve.lib.unb.ca/wayback/20141205151334/http://atlanticportal.hil.unb.ca/acva/loyalistwomen/en/documents/ingraham/) (also linked there on the page), which are both very brief. Both women were Loyalists who came to New Brunswick during the Loyalist migration. Frost came as an adult while Ingraham came as an eleven-year-old child. Frost's diary was written as it happened, while Ingraham's account is recollected many years after the event. \n\nAlso of interest is the brief [\"Autobiography of the Honorable Henry Ruttan of Cobourg, Upper Canada\"](https://books.google.com/books?id=PEgOAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA3-PA75). Ruttan was born in 1792 in Adolphustown, Ontario, about eight years after the town was founded--the second town in British Ontario, after the military town of Kingston. His parents were among the first wave of Loyalists who came there. While it's only a second-hand account when he describes his parents' arrival, it does give insight into the pioneer experience in that province, particularly his account of growing up there in Ontario before 1810. Ruttan was a veteran of the War of 1812 on the British Canadian side, and he recounts his war experience in the text as well. Later in life, he served in Parliament and as a county sheriff.\n\nYou may also be interested in these [other brief Loyalist diaries and journals](http://blackloyalist.com/cdc/documents/diaries.htm) that specifically detail the black experience in early Nova Scotia. Many enslaved Americans fought for the British cause who promised them freedom, and these Loyalists went North in order to gain that freedom and apply for land grants. While they faced all the same difficulties of the pioneer life as their white counterparts did, they also faced discrimination that other Loyalists did not. For a lengthier study of their experience, you may want to read [*The Black Loyalists: The Search For The Promised Land In Nova Scotia and Sierra Leone 1783-1870*](https://books.google.com/books?id=BMY79c675JsC) by James W. St. G. Walker, or [*From Slavery To Freetown: Black Loyalists After the American Revolution*](https://books.google.com/books?id=M4qACgAAQBAJ) by Mary Louise Clifford.\n\nLastly, if you have an Ancestry account, you may also want to peruse the book [*Loyalists and Land Settlement in Nova Scotia*](https://www.ancestry.com/search/collections/flhg-settlementsns/). It's just genealogical information, but it does look like it contains info on the land grants in Nova Scotia of the Turners you mentioned.",

        "Belichick at the time and Belichick as we know him now are not remotely the same coach.  \n  \n&gt; Ted Sarandis, longtime night WEEI host: \u201cParcells snookered Bob Kraft again. This guy has a worse record than Pete Carroll. What kind of coach is he when the players want him? The inmates are running the asylum. I wouldn\u2019t hire Belichick to run a Burger King.\u201d  \n  \n&gt; Butch Stearns, Fox-25: \u201cI still think Tom Donahoe is the key. The Patriots need a football guy to run the team. That\u2019s what\u2019s been missing. We know Belichick is a good coach, but is he a leader? Coaches come and go, but you need someone to run the organization.\u201d  \n  \n&gt; Karen Guregian, Boston Herald: \u201cFootball coaches worth surrendering first-round draft picks for: Vince Lombardi. George Halas. Paul Brown. Bill Parcells. Joe Gibbs. Don Shula. Chuck Noll. Tom Landry, Bill Walsh. Sorry folks. Bill Belichick does not fit the mold. He is not in that coaching stratosphere. Not in my book, anyway. \u2026 We just don\u2019t have any evidence that Belichick is that caliber of coach. He has yet to prove his mettle. He hasn\u2019t won a darn thing as a head coach. And that\u2019s the point.\u201d  \n  \n&gt; Steve Buckley, Boston Herald: \u201cIt\u2019s not just that the Browns fell apart during Belichick\u2019s last year on the shores of Lake Erie; it\u2019s that Belichick, during that last season, developed a bunker mentality and allowed few people, if anyone, to get close to him. Making with the ha-ha-ha with a bunch of sportswriters during those midweek pressers is not going to make Belichick a better coach. Nor will it make the Patriots a better team. But if Belichick can learn to chill a little, to laugh at himself, to see the world as something more than a great big ol\u2019 football field, the betting here is that he\u2019ll sleep better at night. And if he sleeps better at night, he\u2019ll be better equipped for the day-to-day rigors of coaching a National Football League team.\u201d  \n  \n&gt; Sam Rutigliano, longtime NFL assistant and seven-season Cleveland head coach: \u201cHiring Belichick was the greatest error that Art [Modell] ever made \u2026 He just doesn\u2019t have the communicative abilities to handle that part of the job. I think that he\u2019s miscast as a head coach. It\u2019s very obvious he is outstanding as a defensive coordinator. That\u2019s where he belongs.\u201d  \n    \nThe 2000 season was a disaster. Drew Bledsoe had one of his worst seasons, the team offense was absolutely putrid and the defense was barely any better. The hot take journalists of the time were writing QB controversy pieces about Michael Bishop after he got sent in and hit a miracle hail mary in one game (and it's not like Bledsoe didn't have the arm for that kind of thing). Without Brady, either Bishop or John Friesz would have been stepping in to an 0-2 team with little hope. By the time Bledsoe was good to go again, the Pats are probably staring down 2-7 and out of the playoff picture. The following year Bledsoe was serviceable for Buffalo, but it's far from certain that  he would have made a difference in the Pats missing the postseason in 2002 if he were still around.    \n  \nKraft had pulled the plug on Pete Carroll after 3 seasons. He was surrounded by a world telling him Belichick was an awful hire and misplaced as a head coach. Missing the playoffs in 2000, 2001 and 2002 may have easily been enough to get Belichick canned from his second HC position in under a decade and at that point his opportunities would be scant if anything.   \n  \nThere are A LOT of angles to look at with this hypothetical, but you can't view the Belichick of then as you view the Belichick of now. He's gotten better over the years too.",

        "So many options and I'm certain you'll find out quickly that you won't have enough time to do everything you want.  And, even the two places you listed (Niagara and Grand Canyon) are many hours (days driving) apart.\n\nHow old is the daughter?  That will influence how much time you stay at any given place and where you go.  \n\nMy first thought was that Niagara should be a long weekend trip and then build the month-long trip around a road trip to Grand Canyon but it could be interesting to go to Niagara and then cut across Canada and Michigan's UP to get a taste of waterfalls and north woods country which most Americans never see.\n\nAssuming near teen or older, my strawman trip proposal would be (day 1) early drive and most of the day at [Cedar Point](https://www.cedarpoint.com/); (day 2) part of the day at Cedar Point, leisurely drive (or I90) along south coast of Lake Erie and evening at Niagara Falls area; (day 3) drive into Canada with a stop at [French River Provincial Park](https://www.ontarioparks.com/park/frenchriver) and overnight at [Killarney](https://www.ontarioparks.com/park/killarney/camping); (day 4) drive to [Tahquamenon Falls SP]( https://www.stateparks.com/tahquamenon_falls_state_park_in_michigan.html); (day 5) hang out and explore the UP ([waterfalls](https://www.uptravel.com/attractions-2/waterfalls-of-the-u-p/) , [Pictured Rocks]( https://www.nps.gov/piro/index.htm)) and either overnight at Tahquamenon or move on to [Porcupine Mts SP]( https://www.stateparks.com/porcupine_mountains_wilderness_state_park_in_michigan.html); (day 6) [Duluth, MN]( https://www.visitduluth.com/) with maybe some [WI waterfalls]( https://www.thecrazytourist.com/15-amazing-waterfalls-in-wisconsin/) (Amnicon, Copper) on the way and stay at [Jay Cooke SP]( https://www.stateparks.com/jay_cooke_state_park_in_minnesota.html) or one of the many [MN North Shore SPs]( https://www.northshorevisitor.com/attractions/state-parks/); (day 7) this could be a long day if you decide to do all of the MN North Shore SPs up to Grand Portage and also [Soudan Underground Mine SP]( https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/lake_vermilion_soudan/tours.html) with an overnight at [Itasca SP]( https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/park.html?id=spk00181#homepage); (day 8) walk across the Mississippi R at Itasca and then head to Medora and [Theodore Roosevelt NP]( https://www.nps.gov/thro/index.htm) (scenic drive, wholesome Medora Musical, Pitchfork Fondue); (day 9) normally would head to Glacier but adds too many days since going to Grand Canyon \u2013 so head towards Yellowstone and definitely take [Beartooth Highway]( http://beartoothhighway.com/) and the northeast entrance, it\u2019ll be a challenge to get a campground in Yellowstone if you arrive much after 10am but NF campgrounds around Red Lodge and along Beartooth Highway and Chief Joseph Highway and Slough Creek and Pebble Creek in Yellowstone are often last to fill; (day 10) Yellowstone; (day 11) Yellowstone; (day 12) Yellowstone; (day 13) Grand Teton NP; (day 14) somewhere in the [Uinta NF]( https://www.fs.usda.gov/activity/uwcnf/recreation/camping-cabins/?recid=8980&amp;actid=29); (day 15) [Cedar Breaks NM]( https://www.nps.gov/cebr/index.htm) and [Zion NP]( https://www.nps.gov/zion/index.htm) (note getting campsites here on short notice near impossible); (day 16) Zion; (day 17) [North Rim Grand Canyon]( https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/north-rim.htm); (day 18) south rim Grand Canyon, maybe overnight in Page area; (day 19) [Cottonwood Canyon Rd]( https://www.earthtrekkers.com/drive-cottonwood-canyon-road-utah/) to [Bryce NP]( https://www.nps.gov/brca/index.htm); (day 20) Bryce and maybe Kodachrome Basin SP; (day 20) [Capitol Reef NP]( https://www.nps.gov/care/index.htm); (day 21) Capitol Reef; (day 22) Moab, [Arches NP]( https://www.nps.gov/arch/index.htm), [Canyonlands NP]( https://www.nps.gov/cany/index.htm), Dead Horse Point SP, maybe Goblin Valley SP en route; (day 23) Moab; (day 24) [Colorado National Monument]( https://www.nps.gov/colm/index.htm) and [Black Canyon of the Gunnison NP]( https://www.nps.gov/blca/index.htm); (day 25) [Rocky Mountain NP]( https://www.nps.gov/romo/index.htm); (day 26) Rocky Mountain NP; (day 27) Black Hills of SD/WY \u2013 Devils Tower, Custer SP, Wind Cave NP, more; (day 28) Black Hills and overnight at [Badlands NP]( https://www.nps.gov/badl/index.htm); (day 29) now just trying to get home so maybe [Great River Bluffs SP]( https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/park.html?id=spk00244#homepage); (day 30) home.\n\nNow that\u2019s a lot of driving so any extra days over the month you have would make it a more relaxed trip.  Also, this doesn\u2019t include oceans, or big cities, or breweries, or barbecue, or museums, or any of those other reasons people take road trips.  If you can, I\u2019d add a couple days to the MI/WI/MN leg, three or four more days for the UT/AZ stretch, a couple of days more for CO and maybe another day for SD \u2013 so one month plus 8 to 10 days will give you more flexibility and relaxation.",

        "Assuming I counted right, Michigan is the one with 3 blue and 2 white horizontal stripes with a yellow triangle on left with a white circle inside? If I'm wrong disregard this entire post lol. I'm gonna talk to you like you're not from MI, so forgive me if I sound condescending, it's really not my plan here. :)\n\nMost of what defines the state is the Great Lakes, being *the* Great Lakes state. The Great Lakes are the largest freshwater lake system in the entire world. MI brings in a ton of $ from tourism for this reason, as our beaches are [damn near tropical looking](https://res.cloudinary.com/resortsandlodges/image/fetch/w_800,h_520,c_fill/https://media.travelnetsolutions.com/532633aa592b5fa1ff80289af1f6add7/original.jpg). This is due to much of the lake beds being sand, and that brings out the lovely turquoise color of the water. Of course some of our waterfront is sort of [European looking](https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f61d26c00efd0689f45631833be955e0cd7d71a6/c=0-31-2000-1161/local/-/media/2018/07/16/DetroitNews/DetroitNews/636673413618619774-FILE-Pictured-Rocks-07.jpg?width=3200&amp;height=1680&amp;fit=crop), or in some places sort of like the [Pacific Northwest.](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_nuCoAtvJNo/Ve8k7DZXrXI/AAAAAAAAIWM/TWEKKib6Zkc/s1600/DSCN1806.JPG) Our lakes vary and are kind of moody, the 5 lakes have their own personality. The crappiest one is Lake Erie, it's sort of like [the sewer](https://greatlakes.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Lake-Erie-algal-bloom-Aerial-Associates-Photography.jpg) of Detroit and Cleveland and always has algae issues due to fertilizer runoff and pollution. :(\n\nThe lakes are so large they behave like oceans, bringing down massive oil tankers in bad storms, producing [massive waves](https://youtu.be/sI7jVYlu6Us). There's [literal songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vST6hVRj2A) written about how deadly the lakes are. And they truly are freshwater oceans, make no mistake. You can easily die out there. The Great Lakes are home to *25,000 shipwrecks* and about 100 people die in the lakes every year these days. In MI, you are never more than six miles from an inland lake or more than 85 miles from one of the Great Lakes. The name Michigan is the French form of the Ojibwa word mishigamaa, meaning \"large water\" or \"large lake\". **Water is a big deal here.**\n\nAnyway, one of the things about MI that's interesting is our state pride is pretty close to being that of Texas. Nearly everyone around here has [one of these stickers](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiMxYC1w5DjAhWBBs0KHYlhAXgQjRx6BAgBEAU&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FNudge-Printing-Great-Michigan-Sticker%2Fdp%2FB018ETLVME&amp;psig=AOvVaw1n12lwt3RIFBKANRU9XCKr&amp;ust=1561960746850965) (the outline of the lakes) on their car. TBH that sticker alone would make a *great* flag.\n\nAs for land masses, there are two. The Lower Peninsula, and the Upper Peninsula. The upper is referred to as \"The U.P.\". If you live in the lower (and most of the population does), people from the UP joke that you are a \"Troll\" because you live \"under\" [The Mackinac Bridge](https://www.mackinacbridge.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/DI-02284-151.jpg) which connects the two peninsulas together. It is one of the longest bridges in the world, and it is featured on some of our license plate designs as a representation of our state's industrial ingenuity. It is a rather impressive bridge at about 5 miles long. Driving on it is terrifying as your car would be 200ft in the air.\n\nThe state is iconic for being shaped like a \"hand\" or a \"mitten\". People from MI often [use their hands to point to where they live.](https://live.staticflickr.com/2592/4197837905_b13600527d_z.jpg)Our state's tourism branding includes phrases like \"Smitten with the Mitten\". [Check out some of the other state branding stuff here](https://www.michiganawesome.com/collections/stickers). My personal favorite is \"Michigangster\". We are called Michiganders, so it's a fun joke. Michigan gun nuts often have a sticker of [the state holding a pistol](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/6140HIRpCpL._SY355_.jpg) on their car. Gun culture here is huge, as there is lots of hunting and both active/retired military/LEOs.\n\nBut what MI is most *known for* aside from the lakes, is probably automobiles, due to **the big 3** (Ford/Lincoln/Mercury, Chrysler/Dodge/Jeep, GM/Chevy/Buick/Cadillac) being based in Detroit (aka Motor City). And that's not some dead nickname nobody uses, newscasters refer to Detroit as \"Motor City\" all the time, festivals are named \"Motor City Blahblah Festival\" and stuff, it's quite well known. It's also why Detroit and Flint get hit incredibly hard during nationwide economic recessions, because of the manufacturing jobs lost in these cities during those times. When people are broke, they don't buy cars. Luckily, Cannabis was recently decriminalized, and our state is going to make *bank* off of it like Colorado has.\n\nI was a Graphic Designer for a while, I got my BFA and worked for a few years before I decided I hated it. Anyhoo, I do commend you for this project and I like how you are representing the 5 Lakes with 5 stripes, and using the color blue is smart. But I think there is more you could do to really connect the flag to the soul of the state! Just remember these 4 key items: The Lakes, Hand/Mitten Shape, Mackinac Bridge, and Cars.\n\nSorry for the long post. I wasn't joking about MI state pride. I'm quite proud of being where I'm from. It's beautiful and everyone should visit! I swear I should get a job in the tourism marketing office, I'd kill it.",

Time passes quickly, and soon XV will be here! ^(Really happy that Crunchyroll managed to grab AXZ and XV)\n\nRandom thoughts:\n\n* Really sweet seeing Kirika all excited about Hibiki's upcoming birthday. Also, Chris remembers Hibiki's birthday! She must like Bikki more than she's willing to admit!\n* [\"Na\u00efve...\"](https://imgur.com/a/jc2sfjr) So here we see Kirika affected by a trigger word.

She overdosed on LiNKER so that she could withstand the backlash from a Zesshou. She's done this before in G episodes 7 and 12, so she must be rather familiar with doing this by now. [It looks like she took *three* LiNKER doses](https://i.imgur.com/pQzSWlt.png)??... That's a lot o.o\n* [The Kirika birthday thing](https://imgur.com/a/Tpf1Nsd) hit me really hard. It's nice that this little tidbit about her was established an earlier episode (in Shirabe's flashback), so this aspect of her doesn't feel shoehorned in. She doesn't even remember her own birthday, that's so sad :(\n* [In the background, Shirabe's just freaking out](https://i.imgur.com/B7tMDlP.png). Oof :(\n\nI was about to ask why only Hibiki and Kirika are battle, and why are the other four hanging back? But then I realized that they were probably out of commission until Elfnein finishes the post-release bugfixes to their relics, so then I was like okay, makes sense.\n\nGlad to see Saint-Germain finally joining Bikki's side. I don't know why it's never occurred to her earlier that maybe Adam doesn't have the best interests of the world at heart. For someone hundreds of years old at the very least, she comes off as rather na\u00efve... Or perhaps it was a blindspot that came about from sheer stubbornness.\n\nSo it looks like Adam's about to earth a godly power in Tiki, and although SONG has Saint-Germain on their side now, she looks really worn out from her fight against HibiKiri and from sacrificing her life force earlier, so not sure how much help she's going to be. Kirika's completely worn out from her Zesshou, and the other four Gear users are still out of the picture until Elfnein finishes her emergency hotfixes. But Bikki has fist 1 reason 0, so there's that...\n\nSo far Adam's been pretty smug and confident because things have been going (more or less) according to his plan. I want to see Bikki to put a crack in his composure! He's pretty charismatic and a smooth talker and an excellent liar, so I hope Bikki doesn't fall for any of his attempts to take advantage of her overly kind and empathetic nature...",

        "1. For a bit if background. I\u2019m on my second fiance. The first one left me and (no fault of hers in the end) had a mind of a child around 12 or so. It didn\u2019t click until much much later. \n\nBut instagram... I figured out at a young age.. first grade.. that I wanted a girl to marry me and love me as much as I love them. Fortunately and unfortunately, I\u2019m always told I\u2019m very attractive in the rugged sense. Sometimes i see it, sometimes I don\u2019t. But terrible at social cues. The instagram was a last ditch effort to find someone, so I showcased myself in as few pictures as possible in interests and how I look, and added the tags. And people would pick up on it. About 3 messaged me before her. Two of which lost interest after a while of thinking they could handle my mental problems, and the one before my current fianc\u00e9 threated self harm and had self destructive tendencies all the while having an unlimited bank account. (Daughter of a middle eastern thing thats tight with the royal familes there)\n\nAnyway, she had her own problems. And she stalked me a while up until my engagement to my fianc\u00e9.\n\n2. My ex fianc\u00e9 hasn\u2019t been in my life for a while, she lives just in town. Last I know shes still working a deadend job that she refuses to work up the chain because everyone EVERYONE she meets is her \u2018family\u2019. Cheated on me multiple times which I forgave. Only ever wanted mcdonalds. Every time I picked her up or dropped her off from work was an arguement. Always left garbage piles and the room stank because she never showered or brushed her teeth, \n\nAnyway I could go on and on about how vile she is.\n\n3. I\u2019ll list the reasons for each stay in order.\n\u2022 First was my own call. Police arrived, I just thought \u2018Can I do this?\u2019 Ex arrived as i was in the ambulance getting checked out since at the time I went a week without sleep, eatting or drinking and all I did was clean the whole time. \n\n\u2022 months later I got a message. The guy she left me for left her after 3 months. I lost my mind and destroyed my computer to \u2018prove a point that I don\u2019t need it\u2019 I sunk thousands of dollars into it over the years. I picked up guitar instead to self teach and play grunge music. Anyway, i ran into the woods (son of a father with a large estate) called my ex\u2019e father. He told me just to go back. So I did. Walked to the officer, apologised. Got in the car and we shot the shit on the way to the hospital.\n\n\u2022 Third was I took off to a major lake, Lake Erie, across from which is buffalo. Near the peace bridge, ran out of gas and pulled into the walmart parking lot. Just sat there. Cops picked me up. Had cuts on my legs, and i also had burns. Basicly what I did was... if you take canned duster, turn it upside down, it will freeze things.\n\nI have a large burn on the centre of my chest and three on my legs.\n\n\u2022 Another one I got tricked, I\u2019d been smoking weed a very long time. I had money saved, and tax returns. Weed every minute every day from a bong, and a giant water bottle of half crown whiskey and half water. So what happens when youre high all the time, you get sick if you stop. Bad sick. Anyway went to the hospital bc i was told to. They checked me out. Once i saw the doors it was too late. So i just did it. Spent the night. Got up and got a free taxi home.\n\n i left to my brothers after i drove off the job. Sat and slept  on my brothers couch, never getting up longer than just goig to the bathroom. I remember the paramore album \u2018after laughter\u2019 just came out so I had that on repeat, \n\nMet my weed dealer, used to always be through my brother. He gave me free weed and expensive strands for free since I spent over 300$ on weed every single week.\n\nAfter a month i started going out at 3am bare foot and wandering around, found an old meth addict woman crumpled on the sidewalk, she asked for help, I just asked her which way, and carried her home.\n\nAnother time I accidently came across a hooker. She looked drunk, took her to tim hortons, got her a tea and something to eat, and walked her home.\n\nThen a little later my dealer drove over drunk. Was high on some kind of pain killers. I was asked to deal with him. So i brought him in, took his keys, drugs and phone, laid him on the couch and sat in the kitchen and watched him all night. \n\nThen my brother left the appartment one night after his girlfriend at the time was attacking him. He didnt come back. So it was me and her for a solid week, she\u2019d leave for a bar in the day and come back around 6am and sleep til 10 and go back.\n\nAt that point I lost my drug dealer bc he threated to kill himself and called the cops. He didnt like that.\n\nSo I went to a pharmacy, got off the shelf drugs,\n\nSo if you get a pack of nyquil, muscle relaxers and huff lysol. You go into a psychosis, \n\nOne night i woke up and she took my lysol can.\n\nThen we got kicked out and i begged to just come home and sleep. So I did, i had to burn most of my stuff since i could fit it all in my car and really didnt care.\n\nGot home, went to my brothers old room next to mine in the basement. Set a blanket at the floor and slept on it. \n\nEvetually decided on the last resort thing, instagram. It worked, fianc\u00e9 found me and it\u2019s less than 6 hours until she gets up to take a plane from france to canada and we get married on august 1st.\n\n4. If you look up the disorders, I suffer from most if not all the related disorders linked in the wikipedia pages. \n\n5. I had some. I\u2019ve found that the longer one is a psychiatrist, the more they stop caring and write you off and tell you what you\u2019re feeling and thinking as if they\u2019re not listening, \n\nThe best therapy ive had is talking to other people with mental problems, ive had people over and over come to me with their problems and told me everything. I asked one of them why they did this, I was told \u2018you just seem real\u2019 so take that as you may.\n\nCurrently my network is my wife. We have a sort of codependent relationship, emotionally. \n\nMade a point never to lie, since it really is pointless. And work through everything no matter how painful and still be together. (Which we have)\n\nAlso a sort of meditation i guess you\u2019d call it. When I go into a panick attack alone, and my vision starts to warp. I kinda jump into my own mind and physically cant feel anything.\n\nAnyway, I hope my rambling makes sense.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        ". The systems are capable of taking water from the toilet flush to the drinking glass.  The problem lies with aged combined storm and sanitary sewers and sewer plants being inundated by rain events and trying to treat flows beyond design capacity and subsequent overflows. Buffalo is doing their part to mitigate these overflows but shit flows down hill and we've got a host of metro  areas with similar systems upstream of us. I don't want to shit on Lake Erie, it gets enough of that.\n\nLocal creeks will have street runoff, farm runoff but less nasty bacteria\n\nYep, I could've abstained from posting the question but I saw those threads and they advise Zoar or beaches on Lake Erie which isn't what I was looking for. I like the suggestion above to check out the creek at Amherst State Park, and that lead me to find something similar with Sprague Brook so I got what I was looking for.

        "So we moved from WNY to Denver for school, so I have the opposite perspective. Colorado is great, but expensive and crowded in the Front Range and hard to find a job in the Rural areas.  \n\n1. If you have a marketable job then employment isn\u2019t that hard to find. The caveat to this is bein close to a city like Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, Albany, or Ithaca. Science and tech jobs are pretty rare outside these areas, but if you work from home or are in a medical profession you can find work anywhere. Pay tends to be a little lower than Front Range-Denver wages, but cost of living can be significantly lower than Colorado (housing is cheaper up front but taxes are higher). Random employment is harder to find than around Denver, but probably more like a rural Colorado town (bars and restaurants mostly).\n\n2. Internet is just as much of a clusterfuck as Colorado. Some places have Verizon Fios, and I know many people that chose one neighborhood or city over another simply because of this. The Comcast of NY is Spectrum and they\u2019re just as deplorable. \n\n3. Sunshine varies significantly. You won\u2019t be nearly as sunny as Denver or Crested Butte. In general, The closer to Lake Erie you get the sunnier it is, and the closer to Syracuse you are the cloudier it is. Lake Erie North Towns tend to be sunnier thanks to the Niagara Escarpment (wine country). \n\n4. If you drove I-25 or I-70 in winter then you\u2019ve seen worse. NY is largely flat and the interstates straight, so no windy passes with inadequate guardrails. In general, most people know how to drive in snow AND the roads are decently maintained. It\u2019s not like Colorado where you just wait for it to melt and hope for the best. \n\n5. \n\n6. NY in general has a resurgence of wildlife in the last 30 years. Great Lakes cleanup and preservation have been pretty successful, and even Suburban places around Buffalo get the occasional bear or cougar. These events are still rare enough that they are a big deal on Facebook, but NY really is a much more rural and wild state than people give it credit for. Most dogs will be perfectly fine with a little supervision and a fence. Lots of free state parks too; a big culture change when I moved to Colorado was how every park had a fee and was very crowded (usually not the case in NY state parks). Individual counties often run their own parks and open spaces too. \n\n7. This is a pretty big difference, but it has a silver lining. No, there isn\u2019t the emphasis GENERALLY on outdoors culture like there is in Colorado. NY has many more Gander Mountain hunting supply stores than it has REIs, and hunting/rural outdoorsmanship is just as popular if not more popular in most areas than the Patagonia nature families. Still, trail running is pretty big. Most cities have run clubs and mountain biking and cross country skiing groups too. The silver lining is much much less people on the trails. I\u2019ve spent weeks in the ADK and seen one or two people. Some areas are obviously well trafficked but generally trails are much less populated and much more secluded (in a good way). \n\n8. The food in NY is objectively better than Colorado, except in wild game. You\u2019re not getting Elk with paying a heavy premium, but NY is very rural and agricultural and we don\u2019t have the water problems that CO does. Dairy and produce are a world above what you get in Colorado, and our farmer\u2019s markets are actually farmer\u2019s markets. The reason is simple: rural NY suburbs grow a ton of varied produce and have regional agricultural specialties. NY is the second Apple producing state behind Washington, and our apples are crisper, tarter, and cheaper. My mother sends be a box of apples every few months, no joke. The proximity to S. Ontario greenhouses means better out of season produce as well. Buffalo has one of the cheapest and best culinary scenes I\u2019ve ever seen; most of my friends back home are cooks, chefs, or bartenders. One note is that while we do have a ton of microbrews, it's not on the Colorado Level. Buffalo had a resurgance of craft beer that's still going strong, with breweries buying up cheap warehouse space and opening restaurants. Still, you'll be surprised at the diversity of NYS Brews. \n\n9. Parts of Buffalo are touch and go. I\u2019m not going to lie, every 5 or so years some multiracial couple gets attacked in the wrong neighborhood. But these are very isolated cases in specific neighborhoods that have a century of racial tension, and outside of those urban areas you will probably have no problem. Buffalo is surprisingly multicultural due to 20th century migrations and 21st century refugee resettlement (Nepali, Burmese, Sudanese, Somali mostly). \n\n10. NY has a great education system for most kids. Urban public schools are either great (City Honors in Buffalo is one of the best HS in the county) or terrible (generational poverty and redlining). Suburban schools follow a similar dynamic as everywhere; property taxes mean better schools. Rural schools are rural schools. People complain about common core but honestly, after a year teaching in Americorps, I think NY curriculum is very strong. And there\u2019s free State UNdergraduate tuition (Cornell Ag school, UB, Stony Brook, etc,) for residents alongside numerous elite/liberal arts private colleges (U of R, Bard, Vassar, Colgate, Ithaca, etc.). \n\n11. We\u2019re moving back to Upstate after I finish medical school (hopefully). Physician wages are lower and taxes are high, but housing is much cheaper and it\u2019s much less crowded than the Front Range. There's a real sense of place in Buffalo that is lost where I live; most 30 somthings in Buffalo are setting down roots and involved in their community whereas most 30 somethings in the Front Range moved here for work and are temporary. The agriculture is better. The hiking doesn\u2019t have the same Rocky Mountain Views, but it\u2019s more secluded and scenic. The regional influence of Poles, Germans, Slavs, Russians, Peurto Ricans and newer arrivals from Myanmar and Nepal are a treat. \n\nThere are lots of suburban/rural towns right outside of NY Cities that are livable and commutable. In WNY, I recommend checking out East Aurora, Olcott, Eden, Derby, Hamburg, Lewiston, Youngstown, Lockport, and Akron. Of course, Buffalo itself is cheap and livable, with a young and vibrant music, culinary, art, music, and coffee scene. Buffalo is also just a friendly place to live; somewhere where strangers dig you out of a snow drift without asking and randoms at the bar can be your new best friend. I love it. It\u2019s a gem that most people turn away from because of the snow, or the Bills, or their job situation. \n\nSo I\u2019m from WNY so I\u2019m biased, but honestly Rochester and Syracuse are nice cities too with their own distinct cultural flares. Central NY, The Finger Lakes (Ithica especially), Hudson, the Catskills, and the Adirondacks are amazing places to visit, I\u2019ve just never lived there. \n\nHope this helps. NY is a great place with a little bit for everyone. Rural NY is a lot like rural Colorado, but with better food and flatter terrain. ",

        "For those behind a paywall\n\n&gt;VIRGINIA, Minn.\u2014President Donald Trump\u2019s [tariffs on steel imports](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-sets-dates-for-tariffs-investment-restrictions-on-china-1527599565?mod=article_inline) into the U.S. marked a victory for the Mesabi Iron Range region of northern Minnesota, boosting the prospects of a Republican congressional candidate.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The region\u2019s mines are ramping up capacity to meet growing demand for ore in\u00a0steel mills\u00a0as far away as Lake Erie.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;At the same time, Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs\u2014and the [resulting retaliatory tariffs](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-slaps-steel-aluminum-tariffs-on-canada-mexico-european-union-1527774283?mod=article_inline) on U.S. exports by other countries\u2014are creating concerns for Republican candidates in other districts, hurting farmers concentrated in the southern half of the state.\u00a0The duties\u00a0are also worrying [Best Buy\u00a0Co](http://quotes.wsj.com/BBY) . , [Target\u00a0Corp](http://quotes.wsj.com/TGT) . \u00a0and other politically connected businesses based around Minneapolis and St. Paul.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cYour Iron Range up north is pretty happy with the tariffs right now,\u201d said Republican Rep. Tom Emmer, whose district is in the center of the state, near Minneapolis. \u201cYour ag folks are pretty nervous.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Minnesota is a major battleground in [November\u2019s midterm elections](https://www.wsj.com/articles/democrats-interest-in-midterm-elections-running-ahead-of-republicans-1528365600?mod=article_inline), which will decide who controls Congress. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report identifies four Minnesota districts\u2014two currently held by Republicans and two by Democrats\u2014as tossups.\u00a0One of those is\u00a0the sprawling northern district that contains the Iron Range and the port city of Duluth, from which ore is shipped to mills around the Great Lakes.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Democrats, some of whom support steel tariffs, are seeking to win a majority in the House of Representatives. But some GOP incumbents find themselves caught in the middle between the president\u2019s enthusiasm for tariffs, the traditional free-trade leaning of the party and the vocal demands of businesses and voters in their districts.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A boon to some, higher steel prices are worrying other businesses in Minnesota, including Midsota Manufacturing Inc., a custom builder of trailers that has asked farmers and other customers to pay surcharges as a result of higher steel prices.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cI\u2019ve got to go to them and tell them you\u2019re going to have to pay another $1,500 for this trailer,\u201d said Midsota co-owner Joel\u00a0Bauer, who said he was previously \u201capolitical\u201d but recently raised the issue with Mr. Emmer, his representative in the House.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Steel has been at the center of the administration\u2019s tariffs push, and\u00a0most\u00a0American steel begins with ore mined\u00a0in\u00a0the Iron Range, home of Iron Junction, Mountain Iron and other small towns long linked to mining. Mr. Trump traveled to the region last month to support Pete Stauber, a Republican former hockey player who local experts say has a good shot at replacing a retiring Democrat in the House.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cThe miners are very, very happy that they finally have a president that has their back, that stands up against the Chinese government,\u201d Mr. Stauber said.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Lourenco Goncalves, chief executive of iron-ore miner [Cleveland-Cliffs](http://quotes.wsj.com/CLF) Inc., said he \u201ccan\u2019t deny that it did help\u201d when Mr. Trump rolled out broad tariffs on steel imports. Mr. Goncalves said the iron and steel industry can\u2019t compete against Chinese steel that benefits from subsidies, low wages for workers and low environmental standards.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In a measure of the region\u2019s improving fortunes, Cliffs sold iron-ore pellets at more than $100 a ton in the first quarter, 32% more than a year earlier. Most Minnesotans link the reopening of mining operations to trade cases greenlighted near the end of the Obama administration,\u00a0in addition to\u00a0Mr. Trump\u2019s broader steel tariffs.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cAnytime the mines do well, the rest of us feel somewhat of a benefit from it,\u201d said Donn Kunnari, 62, who runs a restaurant and bakery in the town of Virginia after previously working for 42 years in Cleveland-Cliffs\u2019 United Taconite mine. He supports\u00a0Mr. Stauber.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In response, Democratic candidates in the northeastern district are arguing Mr. Trump\u2019s trade fights are disorganized and too broad, hitting Minnesota\u2019s neighbors in Canada as well as China, Mr. Trump\u2019s trade nemesis in the 2016 campaign.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cTariffs can be effective, but you can\u2019t use a sledgehammer\u2014you have to use a scalpel to make sure the American economy survives the surgery,\u201d said Michelle Lee, a\u00a0Democrat and\u00a0former television journalist running for a House seat. One poll shows Ms. Lee neck-and-neck for the Democratic nomination with Joe Radinovich, a former aide to retiring Democratic Rep. Rick Nolan.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cIf the Trump administration is trying to pit miners against farmers or miners against manufacturers, that\u2019s not a winning formula,\u201d said Mr. Radinovich. Like the United Steelworkers Union and others in the border state, Mr. Radinovich criticized the Trump administration for extending the steel tariffs to Canada, whose steel mills buy some Minnesota iron ore.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Farther south, farmers are worrying less about the steel tariffs and more about Mr. Trump\u2019s broad trade campaign against China\u2014and Beijing\u2019s retaliation against American crops and meat.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Soybean-and-corn farmer Keith Schrader said the escalation of the trade conflict with China in May depressed prices and soured this year\u2019s outlook at his 5,000-acre operation. Beijing recently imposed 25% tariffs on soybeans.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cWhen the trade stuff hit\u2014boom\u2014we went back to unprofitability,\u201d Mr. Schrader said. As a staunch Republican, he said he would probably still vote again for Rep. Jason Lewis, seen as one of the most vulnerable Republicans up for reelection this year.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Mr. Schrader said he has \u201crun on periods of thin margins my whole life.\u201d Some of the big companies around Minneapolis aren\u2019t as philosophical about their bottom lines.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cWe are deeply troubled by and strongly oppose any consideration to add tariffs or raise taxes on basic imported consumer goods,\u201d Mark Tritton, Target\u2019s chief merchandising officer, wrote in a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer in May.  \n&gt;  \n&gt; Rep. Erik Paulsen, a\u00a0Republican lawmaker\u00a0from the west side of Minneapolis that is home\u00a0to Target, Best Buy and medical-device makers, was the lead signatory to a letter that argued against flat-screen televisions being included in the initial rounds of tariffs on Chinese imports. Flat-screen TVs have so far been spared, but Mr. Lighthizer recently included other consumer goods such as luggage and handbags in the latest round of tariffs against Beijing.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Mr. Paulsen joined Mr. Lewis and 40 other lawmakers who wrote to Mr. Lighthizer with concerns that tariffs on components used by[Medtronic\u00a0PLC](http://quotes.wsj.com/MDT) \u00a0and [Boston Scientific\u00a0Corp](http://quotes.wsj.com/BSX) . \u00a0will lead to retaliation against the companies\u2019 medical devices, hurting\u00a0their\u00a0growth opportunities in shipping devices to China\u2019s aging population.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cI think the president is wrong on implementing and escalating tariffs, or raising the prospects of a trade war,\u201d Mr. Paulsen said. \u201cA lot of folks were hoping that the president\u2019s tactics would hopefully yield some results, but I don\u2019t see talks happening right now.\u201d",

        "Let see... How about the first month in office when he trotted out the head of the NPS after decimating his budget and give him a check for one month's of the President's salary instead. That dude looked miserable to the extreme. Let's do this so that everyone out of the gate will know I mean business without care for what the greater good is.\n\n\nRepeal and replace the ACA. Why not improve? Why not just replace? Because when it's repealed then the misery of bad health and risk of death can be used to make people desperate to take whatever you want to throw at them. Can't get that repeal to pass, then just stop the payments so that costs go beyond the reach of others.\n\n\nLet's lock thousands of children up in cages - in many cases U.S. citizens. Let's send their parents thousands of miles away to places that we have no way of contacting them to get them reunited. Let's subject those children to unsanitary conditions and risk of abuse. Sounds pretty miserable to me. Let's do this so that the opposition will cave and build a useless wall along the border. \n\n\nLet's sit with our thumbs up our ass while more U.S. citizens die in a single event hurricane than died in the twin towers attack. Let's leave them for months without power. Sounds pretty fucking miserable to me, but you probably got all warm and fuzzy over it. Let's do this to teach them a lesson about who is in charge.\n\n\nSpeaking of terrorists, lets sell hundreds of millions of dollars of war machinery to the country that supplied the perpetrators of the biggest terrorist attack on U.S. soil ever. Let's help them blockade Yemen to the point that it's estimated that 10,000,000 Yemeni will die this year from starvation alone. I call that misery, but you call that a good time. Let's make sure we bump our oil deals with that country and impose sanctions on and provoke their biggest competitor in the region to help them drive up prices and make bigger profits.\n\n\nLet's first provoke and then get chummy with a man-child who has been given nuclear weapons as a toy and holds hundreds of millions of people (including those in U.S. territories) under threat of his under-developed mind and over-developed ego pushing a button to wipe them out. Let's push him to the edge so that everyone can see how great I am at fooling myself into thinking I can make great deals.\n\n\nLet's decimate the standards that have been developed at the EPA that were developed to in reaction to practices that put lives and health at risk. Yeah, I remember when the Love Canal caught on fire. I remember Lake Erie. I know that massive mining and smelting sites required billions of dollars to clean up because of the health risk they created.  Sounds pretty miserable to me. Why would we even consider re-creating those situations. Well, because without them, profits will be higher and future generations of taxpayers can either bear the risk to their health or the financial burden to clean it up (but at least the profit takes won't have to pay in either case.)\n\n\nLet's put people in charge of the SEC that will remove all restrictions and governance from an industry that has shown repeatedly that it will willingly destroy the financial lives of hundreds of millions of people for the sake of their own gain. I've seen massive inflation in the 70's and bubbles burst from telecoms, tech stocks, and speculative real estate. I've seen lives taken from the effects of those losses. Completely misery. Why would we completely disregard the mistakes of the past? Because there's profits to be made by a few today.\n\n\nLet's put someone in charge of our nation's educational standards that wants to gut funding for people that are so underpaid that they need second jobs, but spend more time with the next generation of citizens than their parents do. You really think those public servants wouldn't like to have more money for their work? They are miserable with the situations they are in. The students in the most economically miserable areas of the country gain the most by increased spending. But, let's cut funding under the pretext of reducing government spending, but in reality just work toward letting those that spend the money for private schools to not spend money as well for others with less money to attend public schools.\n\n\nLook around at the homeless on the streets. I've been all over Europe and don't see anything like that kind of misery. Look how many are holding signs about being veterans. We are spending ridiculous amounts of money on the very military-industrial complex that Eisenhower warned us not to create, and so little proportionally is going to improve the lives of our veterans. It's a pittance comparatively. Instead, we're doing everything we can to create more opportunities to killing and for creating more homeless and mentally impacted veterans to wander the streets. If you don't see that misery then you have no soul.\n\n\nI saw the videos and the read the stories from Las Vegas and the many other mass shootings from around this country. Looks pretty fucking miserable to me. If it's not to you then you are a psychopath. Let's use these events as opportunities for the Russian-backed NRA to say we need more guns. Oh, and let's change the laws so that U.S. citizens can't see that the NRA is being paid by the Russians.\n\n\nSpeaking of Russians, let's bow down and worship the political leader of the world's oligarchy and whose opposition is assassinated on a weekly basis. Let's impede any investigation into his ability to influence U.S. elections and discourage U.S. voters from voting in order to control who is in power. That is miserable.\n\n\n\nThe list goes on and on and this President and the members of our national congress on both sides of the aisle that are allowing this misery to continue in order to protect wealth need to be removed.",

        " \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-SLEEPLESS IN BEREO\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n\n\nIfs early Thursday morning, and a slight mist hangs above the murky, brown water of Lake Erie. People are heading off to work, to do whatever mindless 9-5 gig that they have been forced by society to fall in line with. While on the train, some doze off, some stare at their phones, others kind of excitedly talk about the Cleveland Browns opening training camp that morning. There\u2019s a sense of reserved hope in the air, which is pretty impressive given the state of turmoil their beloved franchise has been in the last twenty-plus years. \n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be honest,\u201d one old man (who still tells everyone he knows how Bernie Kosar was, quote unquote, a FUCKING GOD), says to another old man, \u201cit can\u2019t really get worse than 0-16.\u201d \n\n\u201cYea, you really hit the nail on the head on that one, Charlie. But those boys Tyrone Taylor and Bobby Mayfield can probably get us at least 3 or 4 wins.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s TYROD Taylor and BAKER Mayfield you bastard!\u201d, yells Charlie to the the other old man, named Gus. \n\n\u201cThese goddamn millennials and their fancy ass non Christian names I can\u2019t fucking stand it anymore.\u201d Gus whispers under his breath as he flips open the brakes on his wheelchair and takes off down the street. \n\nMeanwhile, in the small town of Berea, Ohio, about 25 minutes outside of Cleveland, the Browns are just waking up at their training facility. It\u2019s a new season, full of new faces and new hope. Coming off of an 0-16 season, there is much room for improvement. \n\nAs players start to file in, a loud honking sound comes from the road. Several people turn around and see an extremely large Orange and Brown RV coming straight toward them. Everyone squints their eyes to try to see who it could possibly be, until Myles Garrett starts to chuckle and says \u201cHaha,, that\u2019s Tyrod driving that thing haha why he look like he got a family of 4 and a dog in the back haha.\u201d\n\nAs the RV gets closer, a figure emerges through the roof. \n\n\u201cHoly shit its Baker!\u201d yells Duke Johnson.\n\nIndeed, it was Baker. Shirtless with nothing on but his Browns practice pants and a Browns flag tied around his neck, he prominently walked to the front of the RV\u2019s roof and proudly stood there, feet shoulder length apart and hands on his hips. He stayed in that pose, surfing the street with the RV beneath his feet and the Browns flag billowing behind him like Old Glory, until it came to a stop at the end of the parking lot. He then gave two very deliberate hip thrusts and jumped from the roof. He landed on his feet and then immediately did a cartwheel into a back handspring into a somersault, stopping right in front of the stunned group of players with a shit eating grin on his face. \n\u201cY\u2019all ready for this\u201d is blaring from the RV as Tyrod dances uncoordinatedly inside of it. When he sees everyone looking he stops and runs over to stand next to Baker. \n\n\u201cSeriously though, are y\u2019all ready for this!?\u201d Baker fervently says to his teammates. \u201cWe\u2019re about to fuck this shit up!\u201d\n\nHe then does another back flip and lands squarely on Tyrod\u2019s shoulders. \n\n\u201cThis is how both of us are going to play QB this year,\u201d Baker exclaims, \u201cMy rocket arm and rugged good looks and Tyrod\u2019s legs and amazingly accommodating shoulders. Win fuckin win.\u201d\n\nEveryone just looks at each other in silence. They are stunned. \n\n\u201cHow has nobody ever thought of this?\u201d Jarvis Landry wonders aloud. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a goddamn game changer, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d Says Tyrod as he held Baker\u2019s ankles. \n\u201cWait til you see us in action.\u201d\n\nAmid the announcement of the new QB system, Denzel Ward had make his way over to the RV. Undetected to this point, he decided to try to look inside. As his hand reached for the handle, Baker stood up on Tyrod\u2019s shoulders as Tyrod coiled his legs and launched them, propelling Baker in the direction of the RV. The door begins to open but Baker reaches it just in time to slam it closed.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t go in there, cuz.\u201d Baker snarled at  him. \u201cMembers only.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat do you mean, members only? Ain\u2019t we all on the same team?\u201d said Denzel. \n\n\u201cWe are on the same team, but this is me and Tyrod\u2019s clubhouse and you guys can\u2019t come in. We are on a different team, a different level than all of you.\u201d \n\nAs training camp wears on, the super stacked tandem of BakRod, as the team liked to call them, was proving to be an effective force. Bakers passes were accurate and zippy and Tyrod\u2019s traps and quads had become sights to behold. Things are looking up for the Browns in 2018. \n\nOn the night before camp broke, the players went out for steak dinners at Texas Roadhouse. Coming back around 10 pm, everyone went to sleep to prepare for the next day. Well, most everyone. \n\nMyles Garrett and Josh Gordon (who finally showed up to camp) decided to go for a run outside the facility to burn off the ribeyes. They were stretching in the parking lot when they noticed a commotion coming from the RV. Naturally, they moved closer to check it out. \n\nAs they approached the RV, they noticed the curtains were drawn in the front, so they were unable to look inside. At that moment, the RV began to sway side to side, as if someone was rocking it back and forth. There was a loud yell from inside, but not one of fear. It was one of lust.\n\nMyles and Josh looked at each other with wide eyes. They knew that Baker and Tyrod were close, but could they be this close? \n\n\u201cBruh, this is fucked.\u201d Said Myles. \u201cI thought Tyrod would be pissed when we drafted Baker, but now they\u2019re fuckin? Naw.\u201d \n\n\u201cYea man I haven\u2019t even smoked today and this is some crazy ass shit.\u201d Said Josh as he pulls a flask from his waistband and discreetly takes a swig. \n\nHaving piqued his curiosity for the last few weeks, Myles opened the unlocked door of true RV ever so slightly. He had to know if it was true. \n\nAll the lights were off, and in their place were a handful of black lights and lava lamps. Loud house music was playing and vibrating everything and everyone in the vehicle. Standing in the middle of the floor, naked but still with the Browns flag tied to him, was Baker. In front of Baker, completely tied to a sex swing, was Tyrod Taylor. \n\nMyles slammed the door and ran. He had seen enough. They never thought the exclusive club they had so long wanted to join was actually a club where the dynamic two starting QBs were engaging in sex acts on franchise property. He threw up in the bushes on the way back inside. \n\n\u201cAnother stain on the Browns legacy\u201d he thought to himself. \n\nJosh Gordon just stood there for a moment, pondering what he just saw. Eventually, he took the flask back out of his pocket, stared at it long and hard and hit it again.\n\nFuck it.\u201d He said as he opened the door to the RV. \u201cHe does have some nice traps though.\u201d",

        "If you are only in town for 1 day, I would say that the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Museum of Art, and Pro Football Hall of Fame are all out.\n\nI'd direct you to 4 or 5 entertainment districts: W. 6th St., W. 25th St., E. 4th St., Tremont, East Bank of the Flats.\n\n**W. 6th St.**\n\n- This is going to be where the majority of the clubs are.  A short walk from East Bank of the Flats.  There are some diverse dining options.  Due to the clubs, the age range is in the early 20's.\n\n- I would recommend Brasa Brazilian Steakhouse or Cleveland Chop for dinner in this area.\n\n**W. 25th St.**\n\n- Somewhat of a hipster area with a good run of bars and breweries.  You'll find a crowd in the mid-20's to mid-30's.\n\n- Breweries include Hansa (European), Great Lakes Brewing Co., Market Garden Brewery, Nano Brew, Bad Tom Smith, and Forest City (short walk away).\n\n- Another area with good food options including SoHo, Citizen Pie Pizza, Ohio City Burrito, Crop, Bar Cento, and Mitchel's Ice Cream.  This is also home to the West Side Market.\n\n**E. 4th St.**\n\n- This is the corridor you see on ESPN, CNN, Fox, etc.\n\n- There are a ton of bars and diverse dining and some entertainment/nightlife.  House of Blues, Mabel's BBQ, Butcher and the Brewer, Corner Alley (bowling/club), Taco Bell Cantina, and Hilarities (classic comedy club).  Lola and Greenhouse Tavern would be my recommendations for dinner/drinks, and Mabel's for lunch in this area.\n\n- This is a short walk from Progressive Field and JACK Casino.\n\n**Tremont**\n\n- This is a world class dining area and you really can't go wrong with anywhere you choose.  I would recommend Edison's for a quick slice of pizza, Barrio for lunch, Dante or Fahrenheit for dinner, Bourbon Street Barrel Room for a drink.\n\n- Ages range from 20's to 60's.\n\n**East Bank of the Flats**\n\n- This is along the river and will have you most diverse entertainment offerings.\n\n- Collision Bend Brewing Company and Thirsty Dog Brewing have incredible patios, good food, and good beer.\n\n- Coastal Taco has some of the worst food, but potentially the best patio in the city.\n\n- Margaritaville has a great rooftop bar, but closes early.\n\n- Punch Bowl Social has bowling, arcade, dance club, but skews a lot younger.\n\n- Big Bang is a dueling piano bar.\n\n- Magnolia is a speak easy-dance club.  FWD is a Day + Nightclub with pools.  DJ Pauly D recently preformed here.\n\n- Backyard Bocce has good food and you can play bocce ball and arcade games.\n\n- Alley Car Oyster Bar has great views and BeerHead has a great beer selection and great bar food.\n\n**Edgewater Beach**\n\n- Yeah yeah yeah... we get it... Beaches in Ohio/Cleveland.  I would check out the Edgewater Beach House.  There is a bar upstairs with cocktails and craft beer.  Its a great place to check out a Lake Erie sunset.\n\n**Craft Cocktails**\n\n- Velvet Tango Room - If you want a memorable experience, call ahead and ask for the VIP/reservations.  Drinks are $15-$20, but you won't be disappointed.\n\n- Porco's Tiki Lounge - Great tiki bar, but again, drinks are $15+.\n\n- Spotted Owl - Located in Tremont, with a different vibe than most bars.\n\n- StoneMad/Il Rione - Talk about an incredible bar and patio, StoneMad is a hidden gem.  Il Rione is great for wine and pizza.\n\n**Lunch**\n\n- Herb'n Twine is incredible.\n\n- I would also recommend the West Side Market and Heck's Cafe.\n\n**Cleveland Signs**\n\n- Check out at least 2 of the 4 script signs - Edgewater Park, North Coast Harbor, and Scranton Flats, are my 3 recommendations.\n\n**Misc.**\n\n- Rent jet skis, rent paddle boards, check out the pier, check out all the bridges along the Cuyahoga River.\n\n- Brew Boat\n\n- Brew Bus\n\n- Some great architecture at The Arcade and the Courthouse.\n\n- Indians game is a great time, especially on fireworks nights.  I would recommend getting some tickets at The Corner district... it comes with a free craft beer.  Great food and beer options.\n\n- Shuffleboard bars, bocce ball bars, pinball bars, classic arcade bars.\n\n\nI have also began developing a spreadsheet for out-of-towners that helps organize different aspects of Cleveland (bars/restaurants/nature/events/breweries/etc.) and can provide it upon request.  But it is important to note that it is far from complete.",

        "Apologies to /u/MrBrightside711 for the bogstandard photo\n\n#Cedar Point, Saturday July 28th\n\nI had so much skepticism of the hype and fanboys circulating around this park, and I still don't know how I feel about it at the end of the day. I know I fundamentally messed up by going on a July Saturday (we were there from 8:30am to 8:30pm and still missed three coasters), but no other date would work for my group. I was cranky about any stacking observed, but ops were generally great. I wish there were freakin' single rider lines, but I understand I was visiting under suboptimal circumstances. My day was overall pretty amazing - I just had to wait in line for 85% of it.\n\n###Steel Vengeance\n\nThe 9am running of the bulls was one of the most hilarious and magical experiences of my enthusiast life. Things soured immediately when the op guarding the front of the line called me out for the phone in my zippered pocket. I told my friends to go on without me (having successfully hidden their phones in their jacket pockets), and I angrily ran to the nearby extortionist lockers and paid my $2 toll to the harpies of Lake Erie. Fuck you, Cedar Point. This was the absolute worst start to any amusement park visit in my life. If you\u2019re at the Point anytime soon, hide the phone (they didn\u2019t give a shit about the wallet/keys/sunglasses visible in my other front pocket) in your back pocket and transition it to the zipper pocket discreetly mid-line.\n\nAs for the ride itself, it\u2019s so hard to compare RMC\u2019s at this point. It was a fantastic ride, but haven\u2019t I ridden it four times before? It\u2019s absolutely insane to me to think that RMC is starting to feel stale, and they\u2019re definitely not, but the wow factor is dying down. This is my problem way more than the coaster\u2019s problem - I can and will argue that it's technically the best RMC. It\u2019s just that the honeymoon period is over, for me. I found my *favorite* parts to be the parts that I didn\u2019t expect - the ones a POV can\u2019t convey. The first half feels rather rote in that respect (though the downward stall and pre-MCBR airtime hill are pretty great), whereas the back half gets you with that twisty airtime hill that dives under the lift and the subsequent overbanked curve (that\u2019s one of the more intense overbanked curves I\u2019ve ever experienced). The wacky airtime within the structure is all amazing, too. We got two rides in (our only reride of the day), but while I\u2019d love to have more, this isn\u2019t the attraction that\u2019s drawing me back to Cedar Point. I can ride the (smaller version of the) same thing at my home park of Kings Dominion.\n\n###Maverick\n\nSpeaking of rides hyped to unrealizable proportions, I\u2019m now mad we call the maneuver \u201cMaverick turns\u201d instead of \u201cIntimidator turns\u201d \u2018cuz Intimidator does \u2018em better /#shotsfired. Speaking of shots firing, I was not expecting the water bursts - those were dope. While this ride was intense, it wasn\u2019t *the most intense thing ever constructed*, and I\u2019m still racking my brain wondering how people think Cheetah Hunt is a family ride in comparison to this. I loved the drops, I loved the turns, and I loved that glorious airtime hill. The stop under the station is a shame, though, and the launch out of there is such a tease since the train is immediately trimmed (Cheetah Hunt doesn\u2019t pull *that* shit). The stengel under the lift is fantastic, though, and the *super ultra* stengel after that is probably my favorite part of the ride. I just wish Maverick felt as fast as it let on, though. It\u2019s the maneuvers, not the speed, that make this ride.\n\n###Top Thrill Dragster\n\nSorry Jay, but this ride's pretty great. The lapbars alone put it above Storm Runner as my favorite Intamin Accelerator. I waited for a proper front seat ride, and that's definitely the way to best appreciate it. It has such a fantastic presence that I respectfully disagree with the assertion that its construction was a mistake (sorry Dick). We experienced none of its trademark downtime, and the ops were on fire. It's hard to compare to other coasters since it's just two signature elements, but it's a highlight of the park I'll definitely queue up for on subsequent visits.\n\n###Iron Dragon\n\nThis was unfortunately pretty tame and bumpy in comparison to the Bat at KI. The finale knot was the only segment with significant swinging - the whole experience felt closer to an Arrow Mine Train than a swinging coaster. Didn't try it with VR, but it seems like a great candidate for that sort of experiment.\n\n###Rougarou\n\nI love this thing's station over water - it's super unique. My friends complained of roughness, but I thought it was perfectly fine, and it helped illustrate how innate avoiding B&amp;M headbang has become for me. I love B&amp;M stand-up layouts because they seem to be far more experimental and include little hills and transitions that you never see on straight floorless rides (that mini twisted hill before the MCBR is fantastic). This is definitely the odd-one-out of Cedar Point's B&amp;M's, but I enjoyed it tremendously.\n\n###Millennium Force\n\nIf any coaster punched above its weight, it was Millennium Force. Perhaps I should have listened to the GTA's - this ride is fast and full of airtime. It's great to finally ride the big brother of Intimidator 305, because they complement each other really nicely. i305 is short and violent whereas MF is long and graceful. It didn't feel anything like other Intamin hyper coasters I've been on - the T-bar restraints shared with TTD were especially pleasant. I also loved how much of the ride was hidden from view - the frontier town petting zoos are extremely well themed to hide this monstrosity sitting next to them. The only disappointing part of the ride was the views of a concrete husk and fucking dinosaurs. This was probably my favorite attraction in the park - though that might be the 80 minute wait clouding my judgement. Last note: the station music was hype as fuck.\n\n###Cedar Creek Mine Ride\n\nA relatively tame Arrow mine train, but still enjoyable.\n\n###Screamin' Swing\n\nThis thing had hardly any wait and an extra long ride cycle - definitely one of the best flats around.\n\n###Town Hall Museum\n\nI got to see /u/Feed_Me_Burgers in the flesh, working on that gorgeous Steel Vengeance model. That was followed by the embarrassing encounter of asking for Wilderness Run vouchers only to be told that they no longer offer them.\n\n###Gemini\n\nThis was the sleeper hit of the park. The only solace I had from our Saturday visit was the guarantee that this ride would be running both sides - which is an experience that definitely makes the ride. High fiving people in the train next to you is something few other double coasters allow, and the layout is perfectly designed for the drama of a race. Our trains were dispatched at the exact same time and hit the (surprisingly short) brake run at the exact same time - as fair a race as ever and white-knuckle close the whole time. The airtime was also surprisingly decent. I was absolutely in love with this 40-year-old classic and its glass-roofed '70's-as-hell station. The whole Gemini Midway with its nonstop '70's music was greatly appreciated in both of our loops through the upper half of the park.\n\n###Magnum XL-200\n\nWith all the stories of engineering goofs around this ride's construction, I had high hopes for this Arrow hyper with (supposed) airtime in spades. Just like Gemini, I was in love with this ride's stylized station - why don't they make them this cool anymore? I sat in the front seat of the last car - offering the presumably smoother middle seat to my friends. This thing didn't live up to either its reputation for roughness or for airtime, at least to me. It was definitely unpleasant at times (why are the valleys of some hills banked!?), but it was perfectly rideable. The returning airtime hills were relentless and janky as hell. I was expecting this ride to feel similar to a Morgan hyper, but these hills come from another era. They do provide crazy airtime, but it's that choppy airtime from pre-CAD coaster days. I'd probably rank it above any Morgan hyper for uniqueness alone, but there's definitely more pleasant hypers to experience today. As arguably one of the most important roller coasters ever constructed, I'm glad that it still gives a hell of a ride.\n\n###Corkscrew\n\nY'all are babies, this ride's fine. That airtime hill with OTSR's is funky as hell, though.",

        "The American Spectator November 1996 \n\nWhatever Happened to IRAQGATE \n\nAs the 1992 presidential race reached its final days, Bill Clinton promised that, if elected, he would appoint an independent prosecutor to investigate allegations by congressional Democrats that the U.S. government had secretly been aiding the Iraqi weapons buildup-and perhaps even its nuclear weapons effort-and then engaging in a cover-up to hide its handiwork. Repeatedly challenging President Bush for the Republican \"tilt\" toward Iraq in the 1980's, Clinton vowed that no political considerations would cloud the investigation. The Clinton team took the issue so seriously that vice-presidential candidate Al Gore, in a landmark speech, called the Iraq scandal \"worse than Watergate.\" \n\nThe story had all the ingredients for a political potboiler: official letters from the director of CIA and the attorney general to the House Banking Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez(D-TX), warning him to drop the investigation of an obscure bank in Atlanta, Georgia, because of unspecified \"national security\" implications; highly publicized allegations by Gonzalez of a White House cover-up a corporate whistle blower who claimed her life had been threatened; and tales of Iraqi agents cozying up to CIA operatives, and buying up U.S. companies to establish the covert arms pipeline to Saddam. \n\nThe focus of Gonzalez's investigation was a massive $5.5 billion bank fraud that the Justice Department pinned on Christopher Drogoul, the lowly Atlanta branch manager of Italy's state-owned Banca Nazionale del Lavom (BNL). Benefitting from U.S. government export credit guarantees, the Atlantic bank lent the money to companies all over world that were supplying Saddam Hussein with weapons manufacturing gear and other goods. In his defense, Drogoul-backed by Gonzalez-claimed he was merely the instrument of a secret U.S. policy to aid Saddam Hussein. Rejecting that notion, the Justice Department indicted Drogoul on 347 counts of fraud and related charges in 1991. \n\nAs the presidential campaign heated up, Gonzalez bombarded the White House, the State Department, and the intelligence agencies with subpoenas, obtaining reams of sensitive diplomatic cables and internal memos documenting the U.S.\"tilt\" toward Iraq. It was these documents (as well as Brent Scowcroft's secret trip to China only weeks after the tianananmen massacre in June 1988) that prompted Bill Clinton to charge , during the final days of the campaign, that President Bush had been \"coddling dictators.\" \n\nNearly four years and several grand juries later, however, the Clinton administration has swept its \"Iraqgate\" investigation under the rug. The Final Report, issued by attorney general Janet Reno on January 17, 1995, and written by Reno deputy John Hogan, amounts to little more than a whitewash of the entire affair. In every case it examined, the report concluded there had been no violation of law. And in a classified addendum, subsequently rendered public, the intelligence community and the executive branch were exonerated of having \"illegally armed Iraq,\" despite extensive evidence of intelligence community involvement unearthed by the Gonzalez investigation and the U.S. Customs Service. \n\nJack Blum, a Washington attorney who served as an Iran-contra investigator for the Democrats, and who has been representing a key witness in one of the cases that Hogan reviewed, calls the addendum \"the most incredible document I've seen in all my years doing intelligence and foreign policy issues in this town.\" In his introduction to the classified addendum, Hogan complimented the CIA for its cooperation, yet seemed to back pedal almost immediately. \"The CIA's ability to retrieve information is limited,\" he wrote. \"In the course of our work, we learned of \"sensitive compartments\" of information not normally retrievable and of specialized offices that previously were unknown to the CIA personnel who were assisting us. \"Translated, says Blum, that meant that Hogan \"stepped into a hornets nest, and still can't say whether the CIA was involved in the buildup of Saddam Hussein's war machine, or not.\" \n\nOne could easily attribute the reluctance to pursue the investigation vigorously as simply another case of Bill Clinton failing to keep his word. And, too, virtually all the sources consulted for this story agreed that the desire to conceal a long and uneasy relationship between the U.S. intelligence community and Saddam Hussein-a goal that transcends presidential politics-probably lies at the bottom of the Justice department's lack of investigatory zeal. Yet with such an explosive political weapon at their fingertips, why did Janet Reno and the Clinton administration back down? \n\nA former employee of one of the firms exonerated by the Justice Department report now tells The American Spectator that the inquiry may have been papered over for an unsuspected reason. \"It wasn't just a Republican scandal, \" says Marianne Gasior, a lawyer who worker for Kennametal Inc., a machine-tool-manufacturer located in Latrobe, Pennsylvania. \"Hillary Rodham Clinton was directly linked to the network that was involved in a clandestine CIA arms export ring.\" \n\nSound incredible? Certainly, the White House thinks so. When we suggested that it sounded a bit odd for an Arkansas governor's wife to be invited in 1990 to join the board of a company that had ties to an alleged arms export network, spokesman Neel Lattimore retorted: \"Everything The American Spectator says about Mrs. Clinton is a bit odd, but I'll see if I can get an answer for you.\" He never did. \n\nMarianne Gasior maintains that the Lafarge Corporation, the U.S. Subsidiary of a French multinational chemicals concern, provided key services for the covert arms export network that supplied Saddam Hussein. To prevent exposure of that secret supply line, and collateral damage to Hillary Clinton-who joined Lafarge board in 1990, just as the arms pipeline was being shut down-Gasior alleges that the justice department was told to bury the investigation. John Hogan hotly denies this. But investigators from other U.S. government agencies who worked on the case say they were \"waved off\" whenever they got too close to exposing the direct involvement of the intelligence community in the arms export scheme. \n\nForeword: Allied may in fact be one of the oldest national security \"front\" companies operated by the U.S. government. National Archives documents show that it was established in 1942, and has frequently changed names and ballooned in size to correspond to the needs of the intelligence community. Its most recent incarnation, according to corporate records reviewed by TAS, was as Illuminati Equipment Corporation, based in Cleveland, Ohio. Dun &amp; Bradstreet lists the company as an \"unscheduled air passenger carrier.\" \n\nLafarge owns 2,600 acres on Marblehead Peninsula, along Lake Erie in Ohio, that have been the subject of intense speculation by local residents for a number of years. That property has been used on occasion by Camp Perry for special military training exercises, and it also houses a munitions plant known as the ordnance Center.\" (To add a touch of the bizarre, the National Rifle Association hosts an annual shooting contest there, giving rise to tales of men in camouflage battle fatigues committing unexplained acts of violence under the cover of darkness). \n\nGasior claims that Marblehead property was used as a transshipment point for secret CIA shipments of weapons components and manufacturing gear in Iraq during the 1980's, and possibly even after the U.S. embargo on Iraq went into effect on August 5, 1990. the equipment included tungsten-carbide armor penetrators, and specially machined parts needed to make cluster bombs and other weapons. Munitions items such as these could not have been shipped to Iraq legally without a special presidential waiver. \n\nThe Iraqis placed their orders through the Technology Development Group (TDG), a London company run by Sefa Habobi, a trusted associate of Saddam Hussein.(Although he was indicted along with Drogoul in 1991 and remains a fugitive from U.S. justice, Habobi continues to travel around the world in his current incarnation as Iraqi oil minister.) TDG farmed out the orders to Iraqi-owned front companies such as Matrix Churchill Ltd., Associated Instrument Distributors of Norcross, Georgia, and Tigris trading of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, who then signed contracts with willing suppliers and turned to BNL-Atlanta to pay the bills. Many Iraqi front companies were closed down by U.S. Customs following Saddam Hussein's August 1990 invasion of Kuwait, although none were formally indicted. \n\nEquipment for the Iraqis that could not be exported through normal channels was collected at the Solon, Ohio, warehouse of Matrix Churchill Corporation from nearby manufacturers-Kennametal (Where Gasior worked), Teledyne, and Mannesman-Demag. It was then trucked up to a long-time U.S. government munitions manufacturer called ALLIED, which operated a facility on the Lafarge property on Lake Erie. Allied's Marblehead plant, referred to in U.S. government archives as the \"Ordnance Center,\" had at one time functioned as a steel foundry making armor for U.S. tanks during World War II. \n\nRead more...\n\nhttp://grahamhancock.com/phorum/read.php?2,390618,390618",

        "There are rumors of Ward 52. Whispers, really. Some aren\u2019t sure it exists. Most think it\u2019s where they send the worst of the worst, the ones so irredeemable that no even solitary can cage their evil. But the truth is far stranger\u2014Shoreview didn\u2019t build ward 52. \n\nShoreview found it. \n\nIt was a cool autumn morning on the shores of Lake Erie. The waves lapped gently against the rocky shore in a soothing rhythm. Gulls danced in the air, squawking in malcontentment. The breeze carried the scent of fish and dirt and fall leaves. And the colors of the forest shone their brilliant array behind the developer Edmundson, who sat on a rusted bench, unwrapping a corned beef Rueben. \n\nHe bit into the sweet and flavorful sandwich, cursing as a dab of dressing fell onto his lap. A short and stocky man approached from the shore, carrying a black leather briefcase. His pattered tie flopped about in the wind, and Edmundson thought the whole thing silly. This was a site inspection, not a meeting with the board of directors. \n\nHe was halfway finished with his sandwich when the man arrived. \u201cAre you James Edmundson? I\u2019m Rodger Pennington,\u201d he said, extending a hand. \n\nEdmundson unfolded a napkin, \u201cjust a moment.\u201d\n\nHe wiped the grease and dressing away, then set his sandwich back into the wax paper wrapping. Standing proper, he stared Rodger down and grasped his hand, squeezing a bit harder than what was necessary. \u201cCall me Edmundson, if you will.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right then, ready to start? I heard the shareholders wanted you to do a walkaround before we finalize the sale of the property.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be a fool not to. Shall we start with the drainage pipes?\u201d\n\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Rodger said, frowning. \n\n\u201cThe drainage pipes near the southwest corner. I saw them on the way in, what are they for?\u201d\n\nRodger seemed confused. \u201cUm, drainage?\u201d \n\n\u201cWrong. Those pipes *should* be used for drainage, but they\u2019re not. They run parallel to the slope of the property, and they\u2019re far too large. So then\u2014what are they used for?\u201d\n\nRodger scratched his head and motioned for Edmundson to follow. The two walked a way down the shoreline until, like Edmundson predicted, they came to a low-lying bog, filled with reeds, where two massive drainage pipes ran back into the earth. The pipes were immense, large enough to walk through, and surprisingly clean from debris. \n\nEdmundson\u2019s curiosity got the better of him, and he removed a small flashlight from his pocket. \u201cIf you will follow me, please.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we should go in there,\u201d Rodger said nervously. \n\n\u201cAnd I don\u2019t care what you think, really,\u201d Edmundson said, starting down the dark, musky tunnel. \n\nThe pipe ran back into the earth less than a hundred feet before it came to a tee junction. One side led to another length of tunnel, but the other led to a locked iron door. Edmundson moved towards the door. He checked it\u2014unlocked! It opened with rusting, grating screech; the sound like an alarm, as if something horrible had just woke from its slumber.   \n\nEdmundson entered a wide room made from iron and concrete. It looked like a prion, and in the far corner cell, lit by candlelight, a man slept on a straw bed. Edward\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cWhat in gods name\u2026?\u201d\n\nThe man woke with a start, just as surprised to see Edmundson as Edmundson was to see him. \u201cHey! You there, You gotta get me outta here!\u201d\n\nEdmundson did his best to keep calm, but the shaking flashlight told a different story. \u201cWhat is here, respectively?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis prison\u2014they locked me in here with the *others*. They think I\u2019m crazy\u2014ain\u2019t that somethin\u2019 \u201d\n\nEdmundson gulped. \u201cWhat others?\u201d\n\nHe flashed the light to the other cells, and realized that he was inexplicable, horribly surrounded. He backed against the door, and the others rustled and stirred in their sleep. It was time to wake up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdmundson knocked on the door of the first-floor cell. Dr. Parker gave him special visitation privileges for this one time, and he intended to use them. The man stood by the window, looking out at the dim and stormy bay. He seemed peaceful\u2014if only for a moment. \n\nHello again!\u201d Edmundson said, \u201cI believe these first-floor accommodations are more to your liking than the ones\u2026 below.\u201d\n\nThe man turned his head slightly, not far enough that his face was visible, but just so that his voice carried through the cell. \u201cSometimes if you want to see a change for the better, you have to take things into your own hands.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I had this facility constructed. Shoreview, a safe sanctuary for those ill of mind and spirit.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a load of horse-shit. We both know why you built this. You know, I can still hear them through the floors.\u201d\n\nEdmundson folded his arms, eyeing the man with a certain respect, but mostly with a sense of pity. \u201cIf you tell anyone they\u2019ll think you\u2019re crazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you think I\u2019m crazy?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019re a man out of his time, lost in a world he doesn\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you won\u2019t let me go?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I should, do you?\u201d\n\nThe man pulled a cigar from the folds of his jacket, sniffing the rolled tobacco. His metal lighter flicked deftly in hand, and he took a deep breath, letting the smoke slowly fade. Shoreview had a strict no-smoking policy, of course. But certain exceptions were needed for those housed inside ward 52. \n\nDr. Parker gave the approval himself, noting that: *While \u2018Clint\u2019, as he calls himself, may be deranged and delusional, and having an inexplicable ghostly pallor, he seems more well-adjusted and level-headed than all others within ward 52, and so some freedom of liberty should be given.* \n\n*Notably, he prefers hand-rolled cigars and pints of old-fashioned ale. His morning drip-coffee shall have some loose grinds sit in the bottom.* \n\n*He enjoys reminiscing of the \u2018good old days\u2019 and will tell vivid and highly imaginative stories about the \u2018wild west\u2019 upon request.* \n\nEdmundson turned away, walking back out of the ward. He stopped at the stairwell. For a fleeting moment he thought about descending to the lower levels. But their faces\u2014Oh god, the faces! His nightmares might very well bring him back as a patient. No\u2014better let the rest of ward 52 stay hidden in their cells, his own timeless collection of horror. ",

        "Now for your second question, I am going to quote a friend of Long's, Murray Rothbard. \n\n\n***There is, first of all, this stark empirical fact: Government ownership, even socialism, has proved to be no solution to the problem of pollution. Even the most starry-eyed proponents of government planning concede that the poisoning of Lake Baikal in the Soviet Union is a monument to heedless industrial pollution of a valuable natural resource. But there is far more to the problem than that. Note, for example, the two crucial areas in which pollution has become an important problem: the air and the waterways, particularly the rivers. But these are precisely two of the vital areas in society in which private property has not been permitted to function.\n\nFirst, the rivers. The rivers, and the oceans too, are generally owned by the government; private property, certainly complete private property, has not been permitted in the water. In essence, then, government owns the rivers. But government ownership is not true ownership, because the government officials, while able to control the resource cannot themselves reap their capital value on the market. Government officials cannot sell the rivers or sell stock in them. Hence, they have no economic incentive to preserve the purity and value of the rivers. Rivers are, then, in the economic sense, \"unowned\"; therefore government officials have permitted their corruption and pollution. Anyone has been able to dump polluting garbage and wastes in the waters. But consider what would happen if private firms were able to own the rivers and the lakes. If a private firm owned Lake Erie, for example, then anyone dumping garbage in the lake would be promptly sued in the courts for their aggression against private property and would be forced by the courts to pay damages and to cease and desist from any further aggression. Thus, only private property rights will insure an end to pollution \u2014 invasion of resources. Only because the rivers are unowned is there no owner to rise up and defend his precious resource from attack. If, in contrast, anyone should dump garbage or pollutants into a lake which is privately owned (as are many smaller lakes), he would not be permitted to do so for very long \u2014 the owner would come roaring to its defense.1 Professor Dolan writes:\n\n    With a General Motors owning the Mississippi River, you can be sure that stiff effluent charges would be assessed on industries and municipalities along its banks, and that the water would be kept clean enough to maximize revenues from leases granted to firms seeking rights to drinking water, recreation, and commercial fishing.2\n\nIf government as owner has allowed the pollution of the rivers, government has also been the single major active polluter, especially in its role as municipal sewage disposer. There already exist low-cost chemical toilets which can burn off sewage without polluting air, ground, or water; but who will invest in chemical toilets when local governments will dispose of sewage free to their customers?\n\nThis example points up a problem similar to the case of the stunting of aquaculture technology by the absence of private property: if governments as owners of the rivers permit pollution of water, then industrial technology will \u2014 and has \u2014 become a water-polluting technology. If production processes are allowed to pollute the rivers unchecked by their owners, then that is the sort of production technology we will have.\n\nIf the problem of water pollution can be cured by private property rights in water, how about air pollution? How can libertarians possibly come up with a solution for this grievous problem? Surely, there can't be private property in the air? But the answer is: yes, there can. We have already seen how radio and TV frequencies can be privately owned. So could channels for airlines. Commercial airline routes, for example, could be privately owned; there is no need for a Civil Aeronautics Board to parcel out \u2014 and restrict \u2014 routes between various cities. But in the case of air pollution we are dealing not so much with private property in the air as with protecting private property in one's lungs, fields, and orchards. The vital fact about air pollution is that the polluter sends unwanted and unbidden pollutants \u2014 from smoke to nuclear radiation to sulfur oxides \u2014 through the air and into the lungs of innocent victims, as well as onto their material property. All such emanations which injure person or property constitute aggression against the private property of the victims. Air pollution, after all, is just as much aggression as committing arson against another's property or injuring him physically. Air pollution that injures others is aggression pure and simple. The major function of government \u2014 of courts and police \u2014 is to stop aggression; instead, the government has failed in this task and has failed grievously to exercise its defense function against air pollution.\n\nIt is important to realize that this failure has not been a question purely of ignorance, a simple time lag between recognizing a new technological problem and facing up to it. For if some of the modern pollutants have only recently become known, factory smoke and many of its bad effects have been known ever since the Industrial Revolution, known to the extent that the American courts, during the late \u2014 and as far back as the early 19th century made the deliberate decision to allow property rights to be violated by industrial smoke. To do so, the courts had to \u2014 and did \u2014 systematically change and weaken the defenses of property right embedded in Anglo-Saxon common law. Before the mid and late 19th century, any injurious air pollution was considered a tort, a nuisance against which the victim could sue for damages and against which he could take out an injunction to cease and desist from any further invasion of his property rights. But during the 19th century, the courts systematically altered the law of negligence and the law of nuisance to permit any air pollution which was not unusually greater than any similar manufacturing firm, one that was not more extensive than the customary practice of fellow polluters.\n\nAs factories began to arise and emit smoke, blighting the orchards of neighboring farmers, the farmers would take the manufacturers to court, asking for damages and injunctions against further invasion of their property. But the judges said, in effect, \"Sorry. We know that industrial smoke (i.e., air pollution) invades and interferes with your property rights. But there is something more important than mere property rights: and that is public policy, the 'common good.' And the common good decrees that industry is a good thing, industrial progress is a good thing, and therefore your mere private property rights must be overridden on behalf of the general welfare.\" And now all of us are paying the bitter price for this overriding of private property, in the form of lung disease and countless other ailments. And all for the \"common good\"!3\n\nThat this principle has guided the courts during the air age as well may be seen by a decision of the Ohio courts in Antonik v. Chamberlain (1947). The residents of a suburban area near Akron sued to enjoin the defendants from operating a privately owned airport. The grounds were invasion of property rights through excessive noise. Refusing the injunction, the court declared:\n\n    In our business of judging in this case, while sitting as a court of equity, we must not only weigh the conflict of interests between the airport owner and the nearby landowners, but we must further recognize the public policy of the generation in which we live. We must recognize that the establishment of an airport \u2026 is of great concern to the public, and if such an airport is abated, or its establishment prevented, the consequences will be not only a serious injury to the owner of the port property but may be a serious loss of a valuable asset to the entire community.4\n\nTo cap the crimes of the judges, legislatures, federal and state, moved in to cement the aggression by prohibiting victims of air pollution from engaging in \"class action\" suits against polluters. Obviously, if a factory pollutes the atmosphere of a city where there are tens of thousands of victims, it is impractical for each victim to sue to collect his particular damages from the polluter (although an injunction could be used effectively by one small victim). The common law, therefore, recognizes the validity of \"class action\" suits, in which one or a few victims can sue the aggressor not only on their own behalf, but on behalf of the entire class of similar victims. But the legislatures systematically outlawed such class action suits in pollution cases. For this reason, a victim may successfully sue a polluter who injures him individually, in a one-to-one \"private nuisance\" suit. But he is prohibited by law from acting against a mass polluter who is injuring a large number of people in a given area! As Frank Bubb writes, \"It is as if the government were to tell you that it will (attempt to) protect you from a thief who steals only from you, but it will not protect you if the thief also steals from everyone else in the neighborhood.\"5***\n\n\nHopefully this adequately answers your questions. I've really enjoyed chatting with you. Even if we disagree, I admire the fact you were willing to engage with me, when quite literally every other comment has been disingenuous. Please maintain that curiosity throughout your life. I wish you the best, stranger.",

        "Firstly I'd like to commend James Renner on the excellent investigative journalistic work he's done on the Amy Mihaljevic case and the Maura Murray case as well. He's a fearless guy and will get down in the \"trenches\" in the dirty areas and bring the truth out. He does this even if he has to knock on the doors of serial killers, and meet them eye to eye. Along with that, he is somewhat obsessive, and has a great mind and doesn't leave out any details. Not to many journalists will go thru what James does to bring out the truth. I'd say he's pretty much brought Amy's case, and the Maura Murray case to \"trial\" over the internet, even if it means pointing the finger at certain people, which you have to do - just like in a court of law. James keeps on pursuing even if he receives death threats to himself or family -- I admire him. I'm also glad he's looking into the very solvable case in the Delphi murders of Libby and Abby. I believe this was a drug gang killing though, seeking revenge for monies owing. I believe one day that James Renner will be an American legend some day, and a household name.\n\n   On Amy's case, although they have these 3 \"hairs\" all they can produce is really a partial profile from the shaft of the hairs. You need the \"root\" of the hair to create a total nuclear DNA profile, as basically the hair dies off as it grows. They can get a partial profile I believe, but only if they can extract a \"mitocondrial DNA\" profile , and sometimes this can't be extracted, because the hair sample is to degraded. I would not get my hopes up on this new series of testing, because even if successful, I believe it will only rule out certain people, or family trees\n\nBecause the major suspect is Dean Runkle, and he's now 73 years old, as I write this, I think James, or Law Enforcement should push for a trial on \"circumstantial evidence.\" There are cases that received convictions on circumstantial evidence, of which there's plenty of in Amy's case. I've read James Renner's book on this case, and it's loaded with factual information.\n\n There are eye witness's that saw the killer pick up Amy, and the composite drawing drawn up from these eye witnesses, and they very closely resemble Dean Runkle. Also some of these witnesses, picked out Runkle's photo from a group of other photos that the police had. Witnesses that saw Runkle at the Lake Erie Science's Center that can attest they saw him there, and that's where he got numerous young girls phone numbers from the guest book. I believe when Runkle was questioned about being at the Sciences center, his reply was something like -- I don't remember being there ? What ? -- if he was not there, he would have said, I've never been in that building. He's obviously being very evasive. ( for a reason) You can see one witness right now on Youtube, describing she saw Runkle in the Science Center.\n\n What kind of man ( 43 yrs old) in a small town would write love letters to a 10 year old boy and give him cash to be a lover ?? It would be a pedophile who would do that, and that's what Runkle is. What kind of man would not submit his fingerprints, like the rest of his fellow teachers, and leave his State, also leave his pension behind, and head for Florida \"flat broke\" and live in a homeless shelter, until he found other work ?? I'll tell you what kind of man, and that's a very \"scared one\" -- a man that has something to hide, and fears for his life.(Runkle)\n\n Because Runkle is 73 years old, and lived the majority of his life a free man, it's time that he is brought to court (now) and charge him with the murder of Amy Mihaljevic . He can be tried with circumstantial evidence -- what do we have to lose ?? nothing at all. The circumstantial evidence is so strong that Renner and LE has collected, I think they would get a guilty verdict, and I'm quite sure of this. If he is not convicted because of a lack of DNA evidence, he will at least have to thru the very stressful trial process, and spend a lot of money on legal fees to defend himself. At least this way, he will suffer some consequences for his deeds.\n\n If we wait until further improvements in technology to teat hair samples etc. --this man will likely die long before that happens.\n\nI can only hope someone in LE or James Renner can somehow make a push for this case to finally be brought to trial, even if the evidence is not perfect, and a lot of it circumstantial. In my opinion the \"circumstantial evidence\" is so strong, that it's just about as good as a DNA match, and I believe many people would agree with this, as I read their comments.\n\nIf the case is brought to trial. and Runkle get's off -- he will surely suffer a long, expensive, and a very stressful trial --exactly what he deserves !!!\n\n I say this \"one last time\" in closing -- **WHAT DO WE HAVE TO LOSE ? - Nothing !!!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

What kind of man would not submit his fingerprints, like the rest of his fellow teachers, and leave his State, also leave his pension behind, and head for Florida \"flat broke\" and live in a homeless shelter, until he found other work ?? I'll tell you what kind of man, and that's a very \"scared one\" -- a man that has something to hide, and fears for his life.(Runkle)\n\n Because Runkle is 73 years old, and lived the majority of his life a free man, it's time that he is brought to court (now) and charge him with the murder of Amy Mihaljevic . He can be tried with circumstantial evidence -- what do we have to lose ?? nothing at all. The circumstantial evidence is so strong that Renner and LE has collected, I think they would get a guilty verdict, and I'm quite sure of this. If he is not convicted because of a lack of DNA evidence, he will at least have to thru the very stressful trial process, and spend a lot of money on legal fees to defend himself. At least this way, he will suffer some consequences for his deeds.\n\n If we wait until further improvements in technology to teat hair samples etc. --this man will likely die long before that happens.\n\nI can only hope someone in LE or James Renner can somehow make a push for this case to finally be brought to trial, even if the evidence is not perfect, and a lot of it circumstantial. In my opinion the \"circumstantial evidence\" is so strong, that it's just about as good as a DNA match, and I believe many people would agree with this, as I read their comments.\n\nIf the case is brought to trial. and Runkle get's off -- he will surely suffer a long, expensive, and a very stressful trial --exactly what he deserves !!!\n\n I say this \"one last time\" in closing -- **WHAT DO WE HAVE TO LOSE ? - Nothing !!!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

        "Here's the GPMI facebook posting:\n\nGreen Party of Michigan US\nFebruary 20 at 1:57 PM \u00b7 \nNEXT TUESDAY\u2019S ELECTION IN TOLEDO - Should Lake Erie Have Legal Rights? #Yes4LakeErie\n\nSomething unprecedented is happening in Toledo, Ohio. On February 26, voters there will be asked to approve the Lake Erie Bill of Rights (starts on page 4), a ballot initiative that would make it possible for citizens to sue those who pollute the lake for damages. The proposal is controversial, quite possibly unconstitutional, but passionately supported by environmental activists who are tired of watching state and federal officials stand by with their hands in the pockets while the Earth\u2019s 11th largest lake slowly dies from man made pollution. In essence, the ballot question asks whether Lake Erie has the legal right \u201cto exist, flourish, and naturally evolve.\u201d\n\nThe City of Toledo depends on Lake Erie for its drinking water. In 2014, phosphorous pouring into the lake from nearby farms made the city\u2019s drinking water unfit for human consumption for three long days in the middle of summer. According to the New York Times, \u201cStores closed. Hospitals accepted only the most seriously ill patients. Restaurants were empty. And some 500,000 people depended on bottled water in the middle of a brutally hot August.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, Lake Erie has been covered in green algae that sickened swimmers and dogs. The slicks were large enough to see from space. Yet the ballot initiative is pitting members of the community against each other. Everyone agrees that farms near the lake are largely responsible for the phosphorous and other runoff from fertilizers that cause the algae blooms and undrinkable water. But much of the local economy depends on those same farmers for its existence, especially at a time when the automakers who used to employ tens of thousands of area residents have reduced their operations in an around Toledo dramatically.\n\nForcing People To Confront The Problem\n\nThomas Linzey is the executive director of the Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund, a nonprofit group based in Pennsylvania that helped write the Toledo ballot initiative. He says it has two objectives. One, to send a warning the community is fed up with a lack of state and federal action to protect Lake Erie. Two, to force the courts to recognize that ecosystems like the lake \u201cpossess independent rights to survive and be healthy.\u201d He says, \u201cThere\u2019s no precedent for any of this. It is almost a new consciousness \u2014 that a community is not just Homo sapiens.\u201d\n\nActually, there is a tiny bit of legal justification on the side of the environmental activists, but it is a very slender reed indeed to build an argument around. In 1972, Supreme Court justice William O. Douglas, one of the most fearsome intellects to ever sit on the court, wrote a dissent in the case of Sierra Club v. Morton in which the majority rejected a claim that the natural world has legal rights.\n\nDouglas disagreed, writing, \u201cContemporary public concern for protecting nature\u2019s ecological equilibrium should lead to the conferral of standing upon environmental objects to sue for their own preservation.\u201d Such willingness to \u201cfind\u201d novel legal principles buried within the language of the Constitution is, of course, anathema to conservative judges spoon fed on the absurd theory of \u201coriginalism\u201d that permeates many of the seminal cases decided by the Court this century.\n\nA 15-Year Campaign\n\nLinzey\u2019s group began working with towns and cities to protect local natural resources 15 years ago. Since then the idea that nature has rights has won support in dozens of municipalities \u2014 from cities with long histories of environmental activism to unexpected places like Tamaqua, Pennsylvania in the heart of that state\u2019s coal mining region. It became the first place in the nation to approve a rights-of-nature ordinance in 2006 after it banned companies from dumping dredged minerals and sewage sludge into open pit mines.\n\nFour years later, Pittsburgh approved a rights-of-nature ordinance that prohibited fracking in city limits. Santa Monica, California, has since passed an ordinance that requires the city to \u201crecognize the rights of people, natural communities and ecosystems to exist, regenerate and flourish.\u201d Earlier this year, the White Earth Band of the Ojibwe tribe in Minnesota announced that it had granted wild rice its own legal rights, including \u201cthe right to pure water.\u201d\n\nDemonizing Farmers Is Not The Answer\n\nThe Toledo ballot initiative has created political fault lines in the community. Yvonne Lesicko, vice president for public policy for the Ohio Farm Bureau acknowledges that farms are the primary contributors to the algae blooms and pollution afflicting Lake Erie. But she also points out other sources of harmful runoff include lawns, septic systems, and golf courses.\n\nFarmers are trying to limit fertilizer and pesticide use, she says, but changes may take up to 20 years to come to fruition. Can the lake wait that long? She suggests the ballot initiative is not a reasoned response to what is a very complex problem. \u201cWe care very much about the lake,\u201d she says. \u201cBut this is not a solution. In fact, it is counterproductive. This is going to lead to lots of lawsuits and stress.\u201d\n\nCity political leaders are conflicted about the ballot question. On one hand, Lake Erie is vital to what makes Toledo a place where people want to live. On the other, the city could be forced to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on legal fees to defend itself against legal challenges to the new policy if it is approved by voters.\n\n\u201cI think everybody is frustrated,\u201d Nick Komives, a member of the Toldeo city council, tells the NY Times. He says he supports a clean lake but opposed the ballot initiative because it could drain city finances. \u201cThe initiative is a powerful tactic. And for me, coming from an activist background, it is important to send messages. But this is probably unconstitutional.\u201d\n\nCapitalism And Sustainability\n\nThere is an old, fairly crude expression that goes like this: \u201cYou don\u2019t shit where you eat and you don\u2019t eat where you shit.\u201d This seems so obvious that it hardly bears repeating. Yet since the first colonists set foot in North America, the waterways have been used as little more than sewer pipes for carrying industrial, agricultural, and residential wastes to nearby rivers and lakes that carry them on to the oceans.\n\nPeople may argue about whether human activity has contributed to a warming climate but there can be no debate that algae blooms and phosphorous contamination are caused by human activity. Where did the notion originate that people could treat the environment like a community toilet and never have to suffer the consequences?\n\nCertainly the indigenous peoples knew better than to shit where they eat. What is it about colonizers that makes them think they can destroy the things that make life possible \u2014 clean air, clean water, and clean land \u2014 with impunity? If the native culture had prevailed, people and nature would have continued to live in harmony. Of course, their would be no interstate highways and SUVs, but the environment wouldn\u2019t be contributing to shortened lifespans and sickness either.\n\nAn analogy could be drawn between putting a price on dumping harmful products into the environment and putting a price on the carbon dioxide that pours into the atmosphere as the result of human activity. Behavior that has no consequences rapidly becomes antisocial but can be curbed with appropriate pricing signals.\n\nYes, the Lake Erie ballot initiative in Toledo would forever change how the local community interacts with the land and the water, but why is that a cause for concern? Just because we have been dumping poisons into the lake for hundreds a year, does that give humanity a license to continue doing so in perpetuity? Is there not some point at which people wake up from their centuries old reverie and say, \u201cWe can\u2019t continue to do this anymore?\u201d\n\nThe Lake Erie ballot initiative may or may not pass. If it does, it may or may not survive legal challenges. But it is a sign that attitudes are changing and that caring for the environment is no longer something that appeals just to treehuggers and socialists.\n\nhttps://cleantechnica.com/\u2026/should-lake-erie-have-legal-ri\u2026/",

        "**Edit 2:** I uploaded all parts I wrote to a [new blog](https://ganymedehistory.blogspot.com/).\n\nIn the last days of the war many germans were burning anything that was connecting them to the Nazi regime. Flags, uniforms and especially NSDAP membership books. Many people claimed they haven't actually been Nazis, they just entered the Nazi party for their career or they were forced or they didn't know what was going on. \n\nAt the end of the war the Nazis suddenly \"vanished\". There was the [\"zero hour myth\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stunde_Null) that said that at the moment of unconditional surrender there were no Nazis anymore and it was a fresh start. So, yesterday a nation that followed the Nazis and the next day allegedly a people that would form the new two german states. But it's not so easy. The people who built up Germany again were mostly the same who lived under Nazi reign. \n\nAt the end of the war there were also mass suicides. It happened at the top of Nazi leadership (Hitler, Braun, the whole Goebbels family) but also among [ordinary people.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_suicides_in_1945_Nazi_Germany) There were towns in eastern [Germany where hundreds killed themselves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_suicide_in_Demmin) as the Red Army was approaching. Many germans feared retaliation from Russians and other eastern Europeans. The Red Army was harsh towards many germans but there was also something else at work here. The Nazis depicted Russians as cruel \"Untermenschen\" for years now to push the german people make them fight until the end, simply out of fear. Many people believed this propaganda and thought the russians were capable of anything. [A huge number of rapes did occure though.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_during_the_occupation_of_Germany)\n\nMany people felt like it would be like the end time. Again, the Nazi propaganda played a big part here. Many people didn't feel like it being \"liberation\" but defeat and occupation.\n\nMany people tried fleeing towards the West because they thought the Allies would be more forgiving and ready to help civilians. There was a [huge number of german refuges.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_and_expulsion_of_Germans_(1944%E2%80%9350\\)) Some came from parts of eastern Germany that are Poland today. They were displaced and lost almost everything. Other people lost their home and work in bombing attacks on the cities. Other people came from liberated concentration camps. It was difficult dealing with this huge group of people. Because the cities were destroyed many homeless people were ordered to live temporarily in villages. People in villages were ordered to accommodate them. This wasn't a nice gesture. Often there was a lot of hate towards each other and if there wouldn't have been allied police forces it wouldn't have worked this way. \n\nUntil the end of the war german people were still living relatively well (partly because of forced laborers who barely got anything to survive and often died because of starvation and work). This changed in '45. Supply broke down. It became harder and harder to get enough food and fuel. A black market came up. Many people tried anything to get food. Trade, steal, sell your own body as a prostitute, whatever. \n\nWinter 1946/47 was particularly cold. It was the coldest winter in decades. [In Germany hundreds of thousands people died because of the cold and hunger.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_in_occupied_Germany) Other european nations were also hit very hard. Europe lay in ruins and people were weakened by years of hunger.\n\nIn the years after the war people were also eager to get a job. But it was difficult to for example work for the occupational forces. If you had a past where you were working for the Nazis your chances weren't good. During this time the allied forces tried to pursue a program of [\"denazification\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denazification). In short, remove anything connected to the Nazis and pursue important and particularly criminal ones. The program had some success but it also had many flaws. Many high ranking and cruel Nazis got away. You could relatively easy get rid of your \"dirty\" past by getting a [\"Persilschein\".](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persilschein) You could bribe another civilian to vouch for you and this already might have been enough. \n\nIt was also difficult to replace all Nazi elements in administrative and other jobs. The number of people who were \"dirty\" was very high and you can't just quickly raise a new generation of educated people to do those jobs instead. So often it was a compromise. \n\nAll in all germans tried to hush up the past. People didn't want to know anything about it, they were busy with survival and later with getting some wealth. This lasted until the 60s when students questioned the role of their parents under the Nazi reign. \n\nThe Allies helped building up Germany again. There was a long debate about what to do with Germany so it could never start a war again. One idea was to transform [Germany into an agrarian state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgenthau_Plan) without any significant industry. This plan wasn't chosen in the end though. \n\nWestern Germany profited massively from the [Marshall Plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Plan) in which the US gave money to help rebuild western Europe. This plan wasn't just for Germany alone but it was one of the reasons for the inequality between both german states. The economic conditions in Eastern Germany were very different. The Soviet forces took a lot of machinery and valuable things (even railway tracks) and brought them home as reparations. This made the construction of an industrial state more difficult. \n\nThere also wasn't an soviet equivalent of the Marshall plan. One important goal of the Marshall plan was to fight against communism. Western Germany was supposed to be a bulwark against it. And it couldn't be this way if it were an agrarian state; it needed industry. \n\nThe Western Allies and the Soviet Union fought together against the Nazis but even during the war there were some tensions. Stalin pushed his forces to a race towards Germany and Berlin to seize as much territory as possible before western forces were able to. This lead to a higher number of losses.\n\nSoon it became more and more apparent that there was going to be an enmity between both sides. Their systems were radically different and now they were supposed to live \"side by side\". All kinds of problems came up regarding how to deal with occupied Germany, for example economic ones. Even years after the war many Germans fled from Eastern Germany to Western Germany because it was more attractive. This was called [\"Abstimmung mit den F\u00fc\u00dfen\", 'foot voting'.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_voting) People in Eastern Germany weren't able to freely express their opinion so they just left instead to escape the economic and political conditions. This weakened the eastern german state. (IIrc) there was also a brain drain of valuable educated people. \n\nTensions rose higher and higher. Nobody knew if there wouldn't be another war. In the past the balance of power in Europe has been radically different, there were many different nations with their own goals. Now only two blocks were left whose military forces were represented by the NATO and the [Warsaw Pact.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Pact) Both sides had those huge armies but for what purpose? There were no enemies anymore that matched your power _except_ the other side. \n\nThe Warsaw Pact couldn't invade Western Europe because of allied nuclear weapons. If nuclear weapons were being used everyone would be destroyed. A new theory came up. It was called [\"Mutual assured destruction\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction), in short: MAD. The only way of preventing an enemy nuclear strike is to make sure that you could annihilate him as well. Both sides knew that attack would be suicide, like shooting yourself (see this political cartoon about [Kennedy and Khrushchev](https://retroculturati.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/ilw35841.jpg) arm wrestling with each other. They are both sitting on a hydrogen bomb). But that's _only true_ as long as both forces are equal. A nuclear arms race was starting. \n\nBoth sides couldn't directly confront each other. There were some very close scenes ([american and russian tanks were looking at each other like this in Berlin](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1F1U0gBMi4M/V2M0KRs3qMI/AAAAAAAAKXo/lBtmDL-9-McBjzk3ZskSmoRuBUqC9RztQCLcB/s1600/The%2Bstandoff%2Bat%2BCheckpoint%2BCharlie%2BSoviet%2Btanks%2Bfacing%2BAmerican%2Btanks%252C%2B1961%2B%25281%2529.jpg)). But no firefight with either conventional or nuclear weapons broke out. Nobody wanted to uncontrollably escalate things. \n\nThis didn't mean though that they didn't fight each other with different means. [In 1948 the Soviet blocked access to Western Berlin.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Blockade) They wanted to create political pressure because Western Berlin was a thorn in their side because of both its political and economic position. \n\nWestern Berlin was cut off from supply. It couldn't sustain itself. Allied forces didn't attack but instead [installed an airlift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Blockade#Start_of_the_Berlin_Airlift) to supply the whole town by using planes. This was a strong sign not just to the population of Western Berlin but also to the rest of Western Germany and any other american allies. There wasn't going to be any retreat and they were not giving up this city and those citizens. \n\nIt was a very complicated, expensive and dangerous procedure but it did work. One year later the Soviet Union gave up in this matter and the blockade was removed. Some call this incident \"the first battle of the Cold War\". \n\nEdit: I had to remove the link shorteners again. I'll try to keep writing and will reply to my own comments. \n\n",

        "P2\n\nSo what does this all mean? Well, I said at the top that I only vote for one party, because there's only one (serious) party in Canada that represents my interests. That would be the NDP, why?\n\nThe short answer is because I'm from one of those post-industrial areas and I've seen first-hand what unchecked free trade can do to an economy, and it's not pretty. The story is that in the 80s and 90s, the liberal leadership decided to blow open our industrial base to trade with Mexico and America and this totally gutted huge sectors of our economy. Other sectors did benefit but the gains went mostly to the top; great time to be a financial investor, terrible time to be a factory line worker. Guess what my family comes from? \n\nIt's rough. 40 years ago a man could finish high school, get a job at one of these industrial plants, and support a whole family on it. Further, thanks to the unions, which used to be some of the biggest in the world, these people could leverage serious power at the ballet box and make sure that working people were getting their share of the pie. Obviously nothing is perfect but fast forward to today and these people don't even have a voice, they got fucked over by the liberal party hard and the conservatives mostly use them as useful idiots by whipping up fear of immigrants and then ramming through even more austerity once they're in power. Both parties are really only interested in helping out the rich and maintaining social cohesion, there is very little interest in either party to meaningfully give back some of the power that common workers lost when the neoliberal consensus arose on this continent. \n\nGrowing up, my first major-city experience was Detroit Michigan, which looks like a fucking bomb went off. It's truly sad to see given that Lake Erie used to be the economic powerhouse of the midwest, and now it's just McJobs, opioids and crumbling infrastructure. I recognize that the left isn't perfect but at least they tried to push back, vs the Liberal party who was totally okay with demolishing that whole area in exchange for making Toronto and New York rich. And these issues are still on the agenda; my brother is a line worker right now; when that factory (already hobbling along) is closed in the next downturn, who's going to finance retraining him for a more \"modern\" job? When my parent's retirement savings takes a shit, and their house becomes valueless because there's no economy left there, who's going to bail them out? These people are not economists, they're blue collar folk, you shouldn't need a PhD in political theory to be able to plan for the future, but that seems to be the way the liberal and conservative party treats Canadians. You didn't have the foresight to learn how to program nano-bots 20 years before that was a thing? Well, too bad, enjoy being out of work as the economy \"restructures\" and try not to get addicted to pills in the meantime. \n\nI have so many problems with the NDP that it'd take a third post to list them all. But at the end of the day they're the only serious party that even gives a remote fuck about any of this stuff; they call out the liberals for their bullshit, they support plans that will equalize the economy, they fight for unions and they've been supporting progressive social policy long before it was politically expedient to (*cough* Trudeau molested somebody, look it up, *cough*). And maybe more important than all that is that they are actually trying to keep economic structural issues on the agenda, as opposed to the other two parties which mostly take Thatcher's \"there is no alternative\" line on how to best structure the Canadian economy on a macroscale. My home region still consistently votes NDP and the reason is because these old union guys don't forget, they *know* shit was better before the neoliberals decide to gut the domestic economy and re-focus on pimping out our natural resources and steering everyone into the finance and service sectors. \n\nThat's why I support them. I've talked to liberals and conservatives and the consensus is that people like my brother, if he gets laid off, that's his problem, even as workers like him have helped make them rich. They don't really believe in the same idea of community that I was raised in. People on the left however, despite their many flaws, get it. You can't have a society where good, honest workers are treated as expendable and expect that society to stay good and honest. \n\nThis is also why I have a difficult time with the \"identarian\" left. My leftism is socialist first. A lot of the \"new\" left are really just the rebellious children of middle-class families living out their hippy dreams and they sell out by the time they reach 35. They don't really have any serious policy prescriptions and are focused more on language policing the poor, which is why they have been shamelessly absorbed into the liberal party. The real future for the left lies in meat-and-potatoe economics, because that's what cuts across these identarian divides. I may have nothing in common with a poor black American in terms of our \"lived experience\". But I know we both need housing, jobs, healthcare, etc. That's what can bring us together, regardless of whether we \"get\" each other. Community members, not \"allies\". ",

        "## [\ud83d\udd17 Link para a not\u00edcia completa](https://outline.com/jNtMdL) \n\n Ilustra\u00e7\u00e3o de como pode ser a superf\u00edcie do planeta Barnard b Ele fica a \"apenas\" 6 anos-luz daqui, tem dimens\u00f5es semelhantes \u00e0 Terra e est\u00e1 a uma dist\u00e2ncia de sua estrela parecida daquela entre o nosso planeta e o Sol. Cientistas anunciam nesta quarta-feira a descoberta de um planeta que orbita a estrela de Barnard e, provavelmente, \u00e9 rochoso.\n\n \u00c9 o segundo exoplaneta - como s\u00e3o chamados os planetas fora do Sistema Solar - mais pr\u00f3ximo da Terra j\u00e1 descoberto.\n\n Mas \u00e9 preciso conter a euforia: \u00e9 praticamente improv\u00e1vel que Barnard b ou GJ 699 b (as duas maneiras como o astro \u00e9 denominado, cientificamente) re\u00fana condi\u00e7\u00f5es para a exist\u00eancia de vida.\n\n O planeta est\u00e1 na categoria de superterra, ou seja, tem massa maior do que a Terra, mas menor do que os gigantes gasosos do Sistema Solar \u2013 por defini\u00e7\u00e3o, o termo \u00e9 empregado para planetas com massa de 1 a 10 vezes a da Terra. Barnard b, de acordo com os dados dispon\u00edveis, deve ter uma massa pelo menos 3,2 vezes a da Terra e d\u00e1 uma volta completa em torno de sua estrela a cada 233 dias.\n\n A descoberta foi realizada por um grupo internacional de astr\u00f4nomos, unidos em dois cons\u00f3rcios internacionais de busca por planetas rochosos, o Red Dots Project e o Carmenes, e acaba de ser divulgada pela revista cient\u00edfica Nature.\n\n \"A \u00fanica informa\u00e7\u00e3o que temos \u00e9 a massa m\u00ednima do planeta, que \u00e9 de 3,2 vezes a terrestre. Isso porque a t\u00e9cnica que usamos, conhecida como velocidade radial ou t\u00e9cnica Doppler, \u00e9 sens\u00edvel apenas \u00e0s varia\u00e7\u00f5es de velocidade ao longo da linha de vis\u00e3o. Isso significa que n\u00e3o podemos distinguir um planeta menos massivo com uma \u00f3rbita de borda a partir de um planeta mais massivo em uma \u00f3rbita inclinada\", explicou \u00e0 BBC News Brasil o f\u00edsico e astr\u00f4nomo Ignasi Ribas, do Instituto de Estudos Espaciais da Catalunha e principal autor da descoberta.\n\n \"A partir de considera\u00e7\u00f5es estat\u00edsticas, podemos estimar que a massa mais prov\u00e1vel para o planeta \u00e9 de 4,1 massas terrestres.\"\n\n Em termos de dist\u00e2ncia da Terra, o exoplaneta s\u00f3 est\u00e1 mais longe, dentre todos os j\u00e1 descobertos, do que Proxima b, cuja exist\u00eancia foi anunciada em 2016 e est\u00e1 a pouco mais de 4 anos-luz da Terra.\n\n Vida\n----\n\n Al\u00e9m das dimens\u00f5es semelhantes, Barnard b tamb\u00e9m est\u00e1 a uma dist\u00e2ncia em rela\u00e7\u00e3o a sua estrela que \u00e9 considerada da mesma faixa daquela que separa o Sol da Terra. \"O planeta est\u00e1 localizado a uma dist\u00e2ncia de 0,4 unidades astron\u00f4micas - 40% da dist\u00e2ncia Terra-Sol - ou 60 milh\u00f5es de quil\u00f4metros de sua estrela\", confirma Ribas.\n\n Entretanto, como a Barbard \u00e9 uma estrela fria e de baixa massa, provavelmente duas vezes mais velha que o Sol, ele est\u00e1 em uma zona em que a temperatura m\u00e9dia seria de 170 graus negativos - a luz da estrela de Barnard fornece ao seu planeta apenas 2% da energia que a Terra recebe do Sol.\n\n \"Este planeta \u00e9 muito frio, est\u00e1 fora da chamada 'zona habit\u00e1vel'. Se pensarmos que a \u00e1gua superficial l\u00edquida \u00e9 importante para a vida, este planeta provavelmente n\u00e3o \u00e9 um bom candidato. No entanto, eu diria que quanto mais podemos aprender sobre pequenos planetas - onde eles s\u00e3o encontrados, do que s\u00e3o constitu\u00eddos, se t\u00eam atmosferas - mais iremos compreender se a Terra \u00e9 \u00fanica ou n\u00e3o\", comentou \u00e0 BBC News Brasil a astr\u00f4noma Johanna Teske, pesquisadora do Instituto Carnegie de Washington e uma das autoras do estudo.\n\n Se Barnarb b est\u00e1 a 60 milh\u00f5es de quil\u00f4metros de sua estrela, a zona habit\u00e1vel calculada para seu sistema seria de 7 milh\u00f5es a 18 milh\u00f5es de quil\u00f4metros. \"Por causa disso, \u00e9 improv\u00e1vel que a superf\u00edcie do planeta sustente a \u00e1gua l\u00edquida. Por esta raz\u00e3o, a vida superficial no planeta pode ser quase certamente descartada. Estimamos uma temperatura de equil\u00edbrio de 170 graus negativos e \u00e9 bastante improv\u00e1vel que a temperatura real da superf\u00edcie seja muito mais alta\", completa Ribas - a temperatura real da superf\u00edcie foi estimada em 150 graus negativos.\n\n \"No entanto, deixe-me salientar que estou falando de \u00e1gua l\u00edquida superficial. H\u00e1 lugares no Sistema Solar que est\u00e3o fora da zona habit\u00e1vel e que parecem ter \u00e1gua l\u00edquida subterr\u00e2nea, como Europa, lua de J\u00fapiter, e Enceladus, lua de Saturno\", exemplifica o cientista. \"Perguntar se a estrela b de Barnard tem um oceano semelhante debaixo de uma camada congelada \u00e9 apenas especula\u00e7\u00e3o neste momento porque sabemos muito pouco sobre a constitui\u00e7\u00e3o do planeta: que pode ser desde um mundo rochoso a um mini-Netuno, as observa\u00e7\u00f5es futuras \u00e9 que devem responder isso.\"\n\n \u00c9 por isso que o f\u00edsico se apressa em conter os \u00e2nimos de quem j\u00e1 imagina um cen\u00e1rio muito parecido com a Terra. \"Por enquanto, o que sabemos \u00e9 que o planeta \u00e9 maior que a Terra e sua dist\u00e2ncia orbital n\u00e3o \u00e9 t\u00e3o diferente, mas est\u00e1 realmente longe de um mundo parecido com a Terra, j\u00e1 que \u00e9 muito mais frio\", afirma o f\u00edsico. \"N\u00e3o temos pistas sobre suas propriedades geol\u00f3gicas.\"\n\n \"A estrela de Barnard \u00e9 provavelmente at\u00e9 duas vezes mais velha do que o Sol. Ent\u00e3o, como o planeta provavelmente se formou logo ap\u00f3s a estrela, provavelmente \u00e9 mais antigo que a Terra\", conjectura Teske.\n\n \"\u00c9 dif\u00edcil no momento estimar algo al\u00e9m disso porque n\u00e3o conhecemos sequer o raio do planeta. Se tiv\u00e9ssemos medido o raio, com a massa j\u00e1 medida poder\u00edamos estimar sua densidade m\u00e9dia e, assim, lan\u00e7ar hip\u00f3teses sobre sua composi\u00e7\u00e3o. Neste caso, s\u00f3 conhecemos a massa m\u00ednima.\"\n\n M\u00e9todo\n------\n\n Para descobrir o exoplaneta, os astr\u00f4nomos cruzaram dados de 20 anos de pesquisas, obtidos por sete instrumentos astron\u00f4micos diferentes. Esta \u00e9 a primeira vez que um planeta t\u00e3o pequeno e distante de sua estrela quanto este foi detectado usando a chamada t\u00e9cnica de velocidade radial.\n\n Trata-se de uma t\u00e9cnica que se apoia no fato de que a gravidade n\u00e3o \u00e9 uma for\u00e7a da estrela que afeta o planeta que nela orbita, mas tamb\u00e9m o contr\u00e1rio, ou seja, h\u00e1 uma for\u00e7a entre a gravidade do planeta e a estrela. Com os instrumentos adequados, os astr\u00f4nomos conseguem detectar pequenas oscila\u00e7\u00f5es que a gravidade do planeta induz na \u00f3rbita da estrela.\n\n \"Temos um arquivo com d\u00e9cadas de dados \u00e0 disposi\u00e7\u00e3o. E a precis\u00e3o das novas medi\u00e7\u00f5es continua melhorando, o que abre portas para novos par\u00e2metros de pesquisas espaciais\", vislumbra o astr\u00f4nomo Paul Butler, do Instituto Carnegie.\n\n Barnard\n-------\n\n Descoberta em 1916 pelo astr\u00f4nomo americano Edward Emerson Barnard (1857-1923), a estrela de Barnard \u00e9 uma an\u00e3-vermelha que fica na constela\u00e7\u00e3o de Ophiuchus. Localizada a pouco menos de 6 anos-luz da Terra, pelo que se sabe atualmente, \u00e9 a quarta estrela mais pr\u00f3xima de nosso planeta, perdendo apenas para as tr\u00eas da constela\u00e7\u00e3o de Alfa Centauri.\n\n **J\u00e1 assistiu aos nossos novos v\u00eddeos no **[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCthbIFAxbXTTQEC7EcQvP1Q)**?

        "Good afternoon. This is James Cordier of Optionsellers.com with a market and account update for November 16th, 2018.\n\n\nNeedless to say the events of this past week have been incredibly devastating for our clients, who I rarely call clients; around the office and sometimes I\u2019m phone calls; I refer to our clients as family.\n\n\nAnd what we call a new account client-call: I often thanked and told the new client that we were so happy that you were joining our family.\n\n\nDr. Steve, your wonderful wife in LA, I\u2019m happy to share with you that Krista\u2019s ailments that we discussed so eloquently are gone. She\u2019s feeling just great.\n\n\nKurt and Grace in Michigan, so sorry to say that we never got to go bass fishing. I wound up walleye fishing on Lake Erie, it was not nearly as satisfying as had I got to go with you.\n\n\nCline in Kansas City, thank you so much for the barbecue sauce. I will enjoy it and think of you always in the future.\n\n\nValeri and Rex; looks like I owe you a Cuban sandwich.\n\n\nOur client in Marseille, my wife and I were certainly looking forward to joining you in the French Riviera \u2013 sounded so beautiful.\n\n\nOur clients in the Gold Coast in Australia I was hoping to see that beautiful sunset you spoke of so many times.\n\n\nMore locally Troy, I was really hoping to become a boating enthusiast with you \u2013 that I will miss.\n\n\nJohn, we talked about you a lot in the office, not sure you knew it but your name was Boca. And though you thought I didn\u2019t enjoy our afternoon chats, I actually did. Good luck in Texas.\n\n\nAlso here locally the biggest hockey fan in the world; Jeff you know who you are. All they wanted to do was sit with you and watch a game. The next time I\u2019m at the arena, I know you\u2019ll be there. And I\u2019ll pretend that I\u2019m sitting next to you.\n\n\nFor the last several years, many people would ask me if I\u2019m reading from a script and I can assure you, I never was. But our audio-visual guy always said to me to keep it short, well he certainly won\u2019t be happy with the length of the update today.\n\n\nSo many of you chose to entrust in us; the ability to navigate in the world of investing, practically every time, we spoke of positioning your account the best we could, I referred back to my father who used to sail an 800 footer on the Great Lakes. And I always talked about steering your investment like a boat.\n\n\nI remember so many times saying, \u2018if you\u2019re steering the wheel and someone\u2019s watching you and you\u2019re making small turns, that\u2019s good and if you\u2019re making large turns it\u2019s probably what you don\u2019t want to see.\u2019\n\n\nThe Wall Street Journal this week and spoke on and on about the movements in the crude oil market and the natural gas market; it talked about the incredible volatility that cost funds and fund managers and hedge funds their livelihood. And clearly they had a livelihood because they had investors.\n\n\nThis rogue wave that I was unable to navigate has likely cost me my hedge fund and the reason why I had a hedge fund is because you are clients.\n\n\nI promise you every day when I woke up and I would check the markets, I was checking for rogue waves.\n\n\nOften when I spoke to you on the phone we\u2019d be on speaker and I had my two hands in front of me like they were on a wheel of a boat, and I always wanted to make the best turns for you and I tried making small ones and I truly invested your funds like you were family.\n\n\nI am so sorry that I was unable to manage the rogue wave that hit us this week.\n\n\nI wish I could name you all by person right now. All 290 clients of ours.\n\n\nYou are my family, and I\u2019m sorry that this rogue wave capsized our boat.\n\n\nIn the coming days, in the coming weeks our office doors will be open.\n\n\nOur phones will be answered and any questions that you might have, my staff Rosemary and Alicia and Matt and Michael will do their best to answer questions you might have and somehow help.\n\n\nI\u2019m gonna thank you all for becoming part of our family.\n\n\nI wish you all the best because every morning when I woke up, and I checked the markets and my wonderful wife made us dinner, when I took my laptop and sat it next to me, I was sipping a glass of wine; because I want to check on the markets and make sure that they were okay.\n\n\nI am so sorry for not managing our ship and keeping her afloat.\n\n\nI\u2019ve bid you great luck and good health and please feel free to call our office if you\u2019d ever want to speak to any one of us.\n\n\nThank you and be well in good health.",

        "I am struck by the difficulty of providing a straightforward answer to what would seem to be an obvious and significant question.\n\nCompiling information from several different sources, however, the essential details and statistics are as follows:\n\n1. The first line connecting Chicago to New York, via Buffalo, was opened on 22 February 1852, although this certainly does not mean that one could board a train in New York and sit on it until it pulled into Chicago. The journey at this time incorporated numerous changes of train, together with a gauge break and a ferry crossing of the Hudson River.\n2. The earliest direct railroad route would have run from Chicago to Detroit, Detroit to Cleveland, Cleveland to Buffalo, and then Buffalo to New York.\n3. By 1854 three railroads offered services between Chicago and points east: the Michigan Central, the MSNI, or Michigan Southern &amp; North Indiana (both of which reached the city in 1852 and provided services to Detroit and to Cleveland and Toledo), and what became known as the Chicago &amp; North Western (1854).\n4. The New York Central railroad, which incorporated in 1853 and was by 1856 the largest business corporation in the US in terms of its capitalisation and annual revenues, made deals with these companies to offer the first scheduled services running between New York and Chicago.\n5. By 1855, when the Chicago Branch of the Illinois Central Railroad was completed, 58 passenger trains were arriving and departing the city daily, and Chicago had become the focus of ten trunk lines with 2,933 miles of track leading from it to all parts of the country.\n6. William Cronon, in his *Nature's Metropolis: Chicago and the Great West,* says that the journey from New York to Chicago took about two weeks in c.1850, and adds that with the arrival of the railroad \"it took less than two days\".\n7. He provides a helpful map, drawn from the 1932 *Atlas of the Historical Geography of the United States*, to show the speed at which it was possible to travel westward from New York in 1830, as compared to 1857, [which you can see here.](https://www.mnn.com/green-tech/transportation/stories/how-fast-could-you-travel-across-the-us-in-the-1800s)\n\nA clearer idea of exactly what was involved here can be had from the *Annual Report of the Board of Directors of the Michigan Central Railroad* (1847), issued at a time when the route was being planned and built. This [contains a table](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VytRAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA3-PA25&amp;dq=michigan+central+completed&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiomIG8yNHfAhVmx4UKHZanDhwQ6AEIKzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=michigan%20central%20completed&amp;f=false) which estimates that the rail journey from Detroit to New York (672 miles) would take 24 hours, and that between Chicago and New York (951 miles) would take 35 hours. This estimate, it should be made clear, is based on average speeds (\"express trains are figured at 33 miles per hour, on double tracks, and 28 miles on single tracks, including wood and water stops\") and not on an actual journey from point-to-point, including waits for connections. If changes are added to the figures, a total journey time of a little less than 48 hours seems reasonable, and hence Cronon's \"less than two-day estimate\" looks accurate.\n\nThe same sort of speeds were emphatically *not* available for freight traffic at this early date, which is not surprising when it is borne in mind that each switch of trains and gauge would have involved some complex shunting and/or transhipment of tons of goods. By the late 1850s, a \"fast\" Chicago to New York freight service was offering journey times of eight days at a cost of $1.75 per hundred pounds of goods.\n\nPassenger travel time had reduced to 24 hours by 1881 and 20 hours by 1893.\n\nWe can conclude from the difficulty of arriving at a precise figure for travel time in the early 1850s that rail-only journeys all the way from Chicago to New York probably were not made very often in the early years. There is a good reason why the railroad route was not favoured by travellers at this early date: steamboat transport via sidewheel/paddlewheel boats on the Great Lakes between either Detroit and Cleveland or Monroe and Buffalo was more comfortable and more popular for quite a few years. Poupard's book transcribes an 1853 advertisement in the *Monroe Commercial* newspaper that points out it was also faster to break the rail journey by taking a steamship across Lake Erie from Monroe to Buffalo than to complete the equivalent journey by rail.\n\n**Sources**\n\n[\"Early Chicago, 1833-1871.

        "# [The other screens](https://i.ibb.co/m9CPMZp/Hi-Shoot-20190105-100205.png)\n\n# [GIF of this theme in Action](https://i.ibb.co/F3TFvrk/ezgif-2-49930b8adedf.gif)\n\nSo this one may require some KLWP knowledge if you wish to customise it.\n\n**What is that jibber jabber under the clock?**\n\nIn order it is:\nDay of the week/day of the month/month/year/device model number/Android version number/battery\n\n**Some Notes on The Map**\n\nTo create this map I started from Brandon Kraft\u2019s MapQuest Komponet. You can find his video tutorial and the link to the component [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2VKYNtZA7E)\n\nAs noted in the video you will need to sign-up for your own API key on the MapQuest website and then go **to the komponent** called 'Map' and add you API key to the global variable \u2018apikey\u2019. Under this global you will see another one called \u2018my.loc\u2019. This centres the map on your longitude. If you don\u2019t want this then the map will be centred on the value in the global \u2018customx\u2019 which is currently set to 34 in the screenshots here.\n\nNext thing is the arc route that moves about every 10 minutes.\u00a0 The values for this are based on a range of randomly generated lat and longs using the globals \u2018randx\u2019, \u2018randy\u2019, \u2018randx2\u2019 and \u2018randy2\u2019 (yes - I know). I have configured these values to generally create an arc across the screen. If you use a different value for \u2018customx\u2019 above or \u2018my.loc\u2019 on you will have to tinker with these numbers otherwise sometimes the arc will be outside the displayed area of the map. Have a look at [this link](https://help.kustom.rocks/i172-tu-timer-utilities-pick-number-or-file-every-minute-hour) for how the timer utilities (tu) function in KLWP if you are unfamiliar.\n\nLastly, the arc route seems to have a bug where sometimes the arc joins the two points and then forms a horizontal line across the screen. I can\u2019t replicate this in a browser, so perhaps the bug is with KLWP. I never figured it out so I gave up.\n\n**Some Notes on the Weather**\n\nSo I initially created a METAR version of the weather as it kind of fit with the pseudo military/aviationy vibe the theme has going. If you don\u2019t know what a [METAR] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/METAR) is, basically it is a snap shot of the weather at an aerodrome in a standard coded format used by the aviation industry. In the theme it [looks like this](https://i.ibb.co/xLQDH5H/Hi-Shoot-20190105-101140.png). But I figured that no one in this sub (except u/brinzer apparently) will know how to read that so I created the normal weather stealing elements from u/MHcharLEE \u2018s last theme once again.\n\nHowever, just in case I left the METAR stuff in the theme. In the root level global variables is a switch called Av.WX. Turn it on and you will get the METAR for which ever location code is in the global variable called \u2018ICAO\u2019. You can look up the ICAO code for your nearest airport [here](https://www.world-airport-codes.com/) . Note you need the proper 4 letter ICAO code (in CAPS), not the 3 letter IATA code. So Luxemburg would be ELLX, not LUX.\n\nIf for some reason you want to learn to read aviation weather then you can get a list of all the codes used [here](http://www.moratech.com/aviation/metaf-abbrev.html) or see the wiki above for how to read a METAR, learn about different aviation MET products [here \u2013 i.e TAFs and TTFs](http://www.bom.gov.au/aviation/knowledge-centre/) and even have a METAR decoded for you by using [this site here](http://www.metarreader.com/). So there you go\u2026.\n\n\n**Font:**\n\n[Atami](https://www.behance.net/gallery/34020116/Atami-Free-Typeface%EF%BB%BF).

In here you'll find the 5 individual icons . Tap on any one, then FX - 'pick image' then on the new screen open the side menu, choose your icon pack and navigate to the icon you want to select\n\nTo change the touch shortcut just tap on the actual icon in the preview window, a small popup should appear down low with an 'edit' button.

        "While urban and Indigenous historians can offer greater detail, I can provide some insight from education history. If you were a young Bostonian in 1770 who'd recently finished a course of study at a local university - odds are you're a Harvard  graduate, a white man from a family of means, between the ages of 15 and 25. It is entirely possible you saw an Indigenous person while still in school. Although the Harvard Indian College had long since closed, Indigenous people from local tribes and nations would not be an unfamiliar sight in Boston. It's also very likely that you wanted to interact with Native people because you wanted to convert them to Christianity. \n\nYour course of study at Harvard was in service to either your future as a member of the political or business class or as a member of the clergy. If it was the former, you were likely from a family of means and Harvard served as a way for you to become a learned man and make connections. You studied Latin, Greek, some maths, some literature, made social connections and were planning on going into politics or joining your family business. In 1770, Harvard was still basically a one school university - you didn't have a major per se but you may have chosen to \"read\" the law or divinity as a part of your studies. \n\nWhile at Harvard, your daily walks to class would have taken you over the land where, for a few decades in the 1600's, the Harvard Indian School served a handful of young Indigenous men. The school, championed by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in New England, was intended to be a way to educate young Indigenous men's souls and minds. It wouldn't be until the mid-1800's that the idea of \"kill the Indian, save the man\" would be adopted by the white founders of Indian Boarding schools; the sentiment towards the education of Indigenous people in New England in 1770 was less hostile, and more benevolent and paternalistic. This isn't to say the relationship between the native people and European Americans in New England was always one of peers and equals. There were shifting alliances and feuds leading up to the war, but rather, the focus at this point was less on breaking down the Indigenous men's connections to their culture and history, and more on supporting them so that they could do what they felt was best for themselves and their communities. This wasn't always the norm, as for an extended period of time, leaders of various European settlements were advised to kidnap and convert Indigenous children as a way to fulfill their Christian obligations on American soil. That fever, the sense that white New Englanders were responsible for converting the souls of future generations of Indigenous people by any means necessary, had muted over time into a more paternalistic mindset. \n\nBy 1770, there were several locations throughout New England where white settlements existed near native communities and native children attended school, mostly religious education, with white children. In effect, these white communities had a laissez-faire attitude towards the local Indigenous communities. This relationship was most notable in the area that is now Martha's Vineyard. After several generations of epidemics, skirmishes, and outright war, the Native tribes that remained were generally not seen as a threat in the way they had been in the past. Thomas Mayhew, who was instrumental in creating the first white settlements on the islands (about 100 miles, southeast from Boston) adopted a non-confrontational relationship with the local Wampanoag people. As a result, native children could safely attend school with white children to learn English and in some reported instances, white children and adults learned to speak the native dialects. \n\nIf the frontier beckoned you, and you went due west from Boston, you would likely see and pass through several Native communities before you even left Massachusetts. Once you passed into New York State, you'd almost immediately be on Haudenosaunee Confederacy land. The Iroquois people may or may not have been hostile or welcoming to you, depending on which clan you encountered and the stage of negotiation leading up to the Revolutionary War. With a few exceptions for European settlements in the middle of the state, you would be passing between and among native communities for the entirety of your trip through New York State. If you kept going due west, you would actually end on land previously populated by the Erie people, on the shores of Lake Erie. ",

        "**The Purple Line,** as shown on the map, runs from Easton through the Lehigh Valley on to Reading and then Lancaster. We will consider this in tandem with the **Orange Line,** shown running from Norristown (why not Philadelphia?) to Chambersburg via Reading and Harrisburg. This is because they really have no business being separate lines -- Harrisburg is a much more important terminus than Lancaster.\n\nThe route from Harrisburg to New York via Reading and the Lehigh Valley is today an NS mainline. East of Easton, NJT's Raritan Valley Line follows (one of the iterations of) this mainline. The system of mainlines continues south through Chambersburg -- beyond which it'll pass through Hagerstown, MD, and eventually link up with the old Southern mainline to Atlanta -- and includes the old Reading mainline down the Schuylkill from its namesake city to Philadelphia.\n\nExcept for the connection between Reading and Lancaster -- which doesn't really generate enough traffic in its own right to justify its existence -- all of the routes the Purple and Orange lines are shown following are thus key NS routes, much like the Gray Line is north of Harrisburg. They also happen to link together the welter of medium-sized cities in south-central PA, and link Harrisburg and Hagerstown directly with New York -- and for this reason it is incumbent for the state and NS to come to a partnership regarding these lines if we are ever to see good passenger rail connections in this sate.\n\n**The Blue Line.** Hoo boy. This is a monster of a line, shown running from Levittown to Philadelphia to Lancaster via Coatesville and West Chester (?) and from Lancaster to Pittsburgh via York and Chambersburg. From there it heads north to Buffalo.\n\nThese are really two separate lines and we will split our analysis into -- let's call it the Azure Division -- west of Pittsburgh, and the section east of it.\n\nThe biggest problem with the Blue Line's alignment is that it sort of has a half-assed idea of where the rails actually run. The Keystone Corridor actually runs from Pittsburgh to Altoona to Harrisburg to Lancaster to Philadelphia; it also quite noticeably does *not* run to West Chester (although it does to Coatesville). The section east of Harrisburg is also a passenger-dedicated route (recall the NS mainline follows a different route) and is one of only a handful of routes currently in the US that has been upgraded to a 110 mph standard throughout -- almost, but not quite, the 125 mph standard medium-speed rail obtains in the rest of the developed world.\n\nThe section between Chambersburg and Lancaster makes no sense from a traffic standpoint -- it bypasses the region's main population and economic center (i.e. Harrisburg) -- and we will ignore it.\n\nThe section between Chambersburg and Pittsburgh seems reflective of a dream of true HSR across the mountains. And -- while I would move the eastern terminus to Harrisburg instead -- I agree! I actually think that the Harrisburg-Pittsburgh (actually Latrobe) segment makes sense as the only true 220 mph HSR alignment in the state. It is also the only alignment in the entire rail network that would need to be engineered *de novo*: the northern alignment via Williamsport is too circuitous, and the legacy PRR mainline has too many curves, as does the PA Turnpike mainline through the mountains.\n\nThe route I found would follow the PA Turnpike roughly from the Susquehanna west to about the Blue Mountain tunnel, where it would diverge, following a more northerly route aimed at keeping most of the tunnels as short as possible and using the terrain to our advantage, notably by skirting the southern fringes of several mountains and using at least one wind gap along the way. I'll have to dig up my Gmaps file for it. Even so, the Alleghenies are a barrier, and the alignment heads straight for the Blue Knob on its way to Latrobe ... but this is a better route than any other I have found.\n\nThat said, that 220 mph route crosses a whole lot of nothing (other than farms and forests). Upgrading the old PRR mainline to 125 mph standard, as part of the general program of working with the NS, would maintain rail service to several towns the *Pennsylvanian* currently services once each way a day.\n\nFinally, let's consider the westernmost, \"Azure\" part of this route. Unlike the section east of Pittsburgh, it's not quite as fanciful; the former Bessemer &amp; Lake Erie mainline does a perfectly cromulent job linking Pittsburgh and Erie. It's owned by one of the Canadian roads now, but I don't remember which one. It would need to be upgraded, of course, but the route is very much there and in service.\n\n**Connections to Neighbors.** Finally, let's talk about the biggest glaring absence on this map -- its lack of connections with neighbors. The Northeast Corridor runs through the state's SE-most corner and the branches to Chester and Levittown on the Green and Blue (respectively) lines seem to be a nod to this, but the NEC's more important function is DC-Baltimore-Wilmington-Philadelphia-Newark-NYC-...-Boston (we'll disregard its transhudson half).\n\nPA's NW corner has a similar available route -- the former NYC mainline linking Buffalo with Chicago via Erie, Cleveland, Toledo, and Fort Wayne, a route that was engineered so well that -- bar maybe a dozen moderately sharp curves, none in Pennsylvania -- it has no geometric speed limit (i.e. the top speed is determined by whatever technology you put on the route).\n\nThe NE corner has a similarly well-engineered, neglected route. The former Delaware, Lackawanna &amp; Western mainline ran from New York to Buffalo via the Southern Tier; it cuts across PA from Binghamton to Stroudsburg via Scranton and was one of the world's first lines deliberately engineered to a 100 mph+ standard. NJT is rumored to be interested in reinstating passenger service on this line to Scranton. Binghamton is also a major junction -- routes diverge to Syracuse and Albany from the Southern Tier mainline.\n\nWe already mentioned that the Purple Line was an extension of a corridor leading to New York, and the Gray, to Baltimore. This map massively underutilizes Pittsburgh, which has connections available along legacy lines to Cleveland (which Amtrak's *Capitol Limited* uses) and Columbus, as well as to Morgantown, WV (home of WVU). Utilization of the Ohio opportunities, however, would require working with Ohio ... until then, Pittsburgh, regrettably, will remain underutilized.",

        "\n[Part 2/3]\n\n.\n\n***Event/Legend Names***\n\nSome place names are associated with specific events, either a historical event or one that's legendary/mythological in nature. The most obvious case is the name origins of the town of Iroquois Falls, built at the falls of the same name:\n\n&gt;\"Once long ago a war party of Iroquois came north into this country to fight the Indians at Abitibi. On the way they captured an old woman and took her with them to guide them. When they were on Abitibi river they drew near the big falls there without knowing it. The old woman was made to stay in the first canoe. When she knew they were nearing the falls she slowed up so that the flotilla of canoes became bunched. The approach to the falls is very much concealed. All of a sudden they found themselves upon the brink of the falls, and before they could help themselves they all went over. The old woman was lost with the rest in saving her people from being massacred by the Iroquois.\" (Speck 1915:26-27).\n\nThe community of Wunnumin Lake FirstNation records the origin of their name as follows:\n\n&gt;Legend says that Weesaykajack, who used to roam in the wilderness, used to hunt for food and found the Big Beaver that lived on the Pipestone River and chased the Big Beaver and its Baby Beaver to the this area. When Wesaykajack caught up with the Big Beaver and its Baby Beaver, he killed the Baby Beaver and put it aside in this particular area of the foliage and as the Baby Beaver laid there in this foliage it bled from its wound. The blood seeped into the ground from the Baby Beaver\u2019s wound and this blood made the ground turn into this clay called \"Wun-num-mun\". This is how the community of Wunnumin Lake got its name.  ([Wunnumin Lake First Nation](http://www.wunnumin.ca/history.html) )\n\n.\n\n\n.\n\n**ENTER EUROPEANS**\n\n.\n\n***Fur Trade (1670s-1900s)***\n\n\n*French Fur Trade*\n\nEuropeans arrived in northern Ontario in the 17th and 18th centuries, with the English making their way south from the shores of Hudson and James Bays and the French making their way north from the St-Lawrence.   The earliest European names are often associated with the fur trade, whether it be the posts/forts themselves or names associated with the travel routes they used.  \n\nThe French, being the first in the inland areas, named certain rivers which they frequently travelled or traded upon as well as the rapids/portages and other geographic features they canoed past.  As you can see in [this map from 1688](https://www.loc.gov/resource/g3300.ct000668/), French names still existing in northern Ontario deal with geographic features (D\u00e9troit de S. Germain [St. Germain Narrows]), rivers (R. des Fran\u00e7ois [French River]), lakes (Lac du Labyrinthe), and portages (Portage de Joachim, Portage Talon, Portage des Recollects, etc) along their travel/trade routes.  Interestingly, portages on the upper Ottawa River were occasionally named after Saints, or technically after the Saint's Day on which the portage was used, while others were named for geographic features (Portage de la Roche Fondue [Melted Rock Portage]) or animals (Portage du Chat [Cat Portage] and Rat Portage).\n\nTwo interesting river examples are the French River (la Rivi\u00e8re des Fran\u00e7ais) and the Montreal River (Rivi\u00e8re Montr\u00e9al).  Beginning with Champlain in 1615, the French River was used as the main travel route between the Ottawa River and Lake Huron via Lake Nipissing, drastically cutting the travel time and effort required while also bypassing those dangerous Iroquois in Lake Ontario and Lake Erie.  Over the following 300 years, thousands of French and French-Canadian explorers, voyageurs, and coureurs de bois would travel along it.  \n\nThe traders also used the names of familiar places, in this case Montreal, the home community of many French people trading within the district.  The Montreal River is found on Lake Timiskaming.  A French fort, Fort T\u00e9miscamingue, was built at the mouth of this river in the late 1670s or early 1680s, later destroyed by the Iroquois in 1688 and moved to the other side of the lake.\n\nInterestingly, these two names are also repeated elsewhere in the province, probably for the same reasons.  There is a second French River emptying into James Bay, probably used by the French to compete with the English for their trade at Moose Fort.  There is also another Montreal River on Lake Superior which also was a centre of French trade. \n\n.\n\n*English Fur Trade*\n\nThe English fur trade was initially centered around Hudson Bay and James Bay until the 1770s when trade posts were built inland.  The first posts along the shores of the bay were known as \"factories\" Moose Fort (aka Moose Factory) and York Factory, so named because they were operated by a \"factor\", or chief trader.  As the HBC spread inland in the 1770s, they began establishing posts to trade directly with the locals as opposed to waiting for them to come to the bay.  Instead of \"factories\", these early inland posts were known as \"houses\".  These posts gave rise to modern place and community names.  For example, Frederick House was established on \"waanadawaangaa\" lake, giving rise to the modern name Frederick House Lake.  Cumberland House in Saskatchewan is a community named after HBC Cumberland House.  \n\nAs Indigenous settlement patterns changed from lake/river-based settlement to trade post-oriented settlement, people began identifying with the particular post.  Brunswick House gave rise to the community of Brunswick House First Nation while the community of New Post First Nation (now known as Taykwa Tagamou Nation) formed around HBC New Post.  There are countless other examples.  This style of naming based on HBC posts was common until the end of the fur trade in the late 1800s and early 1900s.\n\nNot all Indigenous communities were named based on the nearby trading posts.  During the early settlement of northern Ontario in the early 1900s, Indigenous communities were still present across the landscape and were not directly associated with particular trade posts, despite interacting with the new settlers.  For example, as late at the 1930s, Indigenous communities near Timmins were present on Nighthawk Lake and at Barrber's Bay on Frederick House Lake.  According to Abel (2006:88-89):\n\n&gt;\"Some First Nations settlements, including Matachewan (on the lake that feeds the Montreal River) and Barber's Bay (just east of Connaught on Frederick House Lake), remained less affected by the new economy, at least initially.  During the Porcupine gold rush, people at Barber's Bay helped to guide and provision the argonauts, and after the railway was built through they returned to trapping and living off the land, supplementing their income with small-scale vegetable growing. [...]  Another important Aboriginal settlement on St Peter's Bay at the south end of Nighthawk Lake (in Carman Township) remained less affected by the changes going on around it.  Its people went to visit the new resource towns and then returned to their own homes in these small segregated settlements.  [...]  **Finally, there were settlements such as those at Barber's Bay and St Peter's Bay, which were ethnically segregated, materially poor, and so marginalized that their real names were known only to their Aboriginal inhabitants**.\" [emphasis mine]\n",

        "Sure thing!\n\n**1/2**\n\n&gt; Rumpsey Dumpsey, Rumpsey Dumpsey, Colonel Johnson killed Tecumseh\n\nThis was a political slogan of Richard Mentor Johnson, written by William Emmons, a man who *also* wrote a play, [*The battle of the Thames: or The death of Tecumseh*](https://archive.org/details/battleofthamesor00emmo/page/n1), as well as a biography of Johnson. It was first popularized in 1836, when Johnson was running for vice-president alongside Martin Van Buren. \n\nThere were, if you'll excuse a short digression, *two* wars of 1812. The first was the one waged on the fields of Canada and the United States, and the second was in political rhetoric twenty years or more after the action was over, and participants were running for office based on their participation in the war. The death of Tecumseh became a feather in the cap of Johnson, who enjoyed a small amount of fame for his alleged killing of the famous chief.\n\nThe moment was immortalized, like those above, in [numerous](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Battle_of_the_Thames.PNG/1200px-Battle_of_the_Thames.PNG) [depictions](https://www.warmuseum.ca/war-of-1812/files/2012/11/3D-GR01-The-Battle-of-the-Thames.jpg) [in art](http://b02.deliver.odai.yale.edu/a2/a9/a2a97118-d6e8-4766-b936-6f619dbb8593/ag-obj-43742-001-rpd-med.jpg), [as well](http://media.web.britannica.com/eb-media/06/78706-004-1B911FEF.jpg).\n___________________\n\nTecumseh was killed at the Battle of the Thames (aka the Battle of Moraviantown), in October, 1813. The United States had just won the Battle of Lake Erie, and their naval superiority on the lower Great Lakes allowed William Henry Harrison to bring his army of ~3500 men across the Detroit River and into Canada. Opposing them were ~1500 British soldiers and Indian allies. Henry Procter, their commander, retreated from the American force until he decided to make his stand on an open plan between a swampland and the Thames river.\n\nI won't get into the tactics of the battle much, suffice it to say that Procter's choice for a stand was not advantageous, and the combination of American riflemen and cavalry complicated his dispositions. His native allies under Tecumseh and Roundhead deployed in the swamp.\n\nThe Americans formed their cavalry into several columns, and their initial charge was all it took to rout the ~800 British regulars, but, according to an eye-witness, \"the enemy then attacked the Indians who were on the right, and the action with them continued with them upwards of an hour.\" A different witness claimed that the Indians, \"having tree'd themselves, withstood [the Americans] so gallantly that the enemy were obliged to retire.\"\n\nIn any event, the disposition of the Native troops made the American cavalry less effective. After their first charge, at an Indian force in the open between two swamps, was forced back, Harrison formed a \"forlorn hope\" of cavalry, essentially a forward screen of volunteers whose job was to absorb the defenders' volley so that the forces *behind* them could charge forward without the disruption of enemy fire.\n\nRichard Mentor Johnson, a colonel of the Kentucky Volunteer Cavalry (a militia force, which often goes unrecognized in the scramble to impart blame on the US army's numerous failures during the war), was one of the men of the forlorn hope, and one of its few survivors. The fighting ahead of the advancing troops was brutal, close-ranged and chaotic, and the advance of the troops behind the hope caused even more disarray. Johnson ordered his men to dismount and fight on foot.\n\nIt was here, in his confused melee, that Tecumseh was killed. *Most* of the accounts put Johnson and Tecumseh very close together, and the very first sources to describe the battle suggest that Johnson was the one that killed Tecumseh: \"repeated charges and repulses took place on each side. Col. Johnson was wounded in the first fire &amp; Genl. Tecumseh it is said fell by the hands of our Col.\"\n\nSimple enough, really. But, like with the generals I wrote about above, these accounts also very quickly lapse into dramatic, rhetorical invocations about the precise manner of Tecumseh's death. The noble, dying general living long enough to be told of his victory was a device that was used to bolster British and American ideas about dignity and honor and personal sacrifice, and the same types of tropes were laid on thickly about Tecumseh's own death, but with ideas about the nobility and savage integrity of an Indian Warrior at play. Another letter written shortly after the battle is one such:\n\n&gt; In this charge Col. Johnson was badly wounded. As soon as I saw him fall I immediately called out to several of our men to save Col. Johnson. I saw an Indian rushing on him when he was down, but he managed with the bravery and strength he had left to shoot the Indian before he was in striking distance of col. Johnson. Tecumsey was shot directly in the left side of his breast. He bled to death immediately. I looked at him after his death. *He was a fine looking man.* His British friends took his body to Sandwich for burial.\n\nOther accounts get even more dramatic in their representation of Tecumseh:\n\n&gt; Tecumseh was certainly killed - I saw him with my own eyes - it was the first time I had seen this celebrated chief. There was something so majestic, so dignified, and yet so mild in his countenance, as he lay stretched out on his back on the ground where a few minutes before, he had rallied his men to the fight, that while gazing on hims with admiration and pity, *I forgot he was a savage*. He had received a wound in the arm and had bound it up before he received the mortal wound. He had such a countenance as I shall never forget. he did not appear to me so large a man as he was represented - I did not suppose his height exceeded 5 feet 10 or 11 inches, but exceedingly well proportioned. The British say he compelled them to fight.\n\nThe source for these above descriptions is John Sugden, in *Tecumseh's Last Stand* which is more or less the only in-depth treatment of this subject and still one of the better examples of the Native role in the War of 1812. Because Sugden is more interested in the politicization of Tecumseh's death (more below), he doesn't really investigate the parts of this that *I* find interesting, which is the way that white men represented Tecumseh in death.\n\nRe-read the quote above, and think about it for a moment, and about how it's different from the descriptions of the death of white generals. Notice how the writer - Major Thomas Rowland - makes it about *his own* feelings and perceptions. Tecumseh is \"dignified\" so much so that Rowland nearly forgot that he was a \"savage.\" He had a countenance that is undescribed but unforgettable. And he's not as tall as Rowland thought he ought to be, given the stories, but only 5'11\". \n\nCertainly there are some efforts toward getting into Tecumseh's head, here \"the British say he compelled them to fight\" and an allusion to Tecumseh's rallying efforts, but there's nothing anywhere close to the kind of poetic allegory attributed to men like Wolfe and Nelson. Tecumseh's death is about the *effect it had on the men around him,* not about Tecumseh himself.\n\nThere was some dispute to this tale. To make a long story short, later accounts written by other men (some participants in the battle and some not), commonly represented Tecumseh as dying \"with hatchet raised\" in mid-charge, or mid-cry, and increasingly describe Johnson in rhetorical language: his white horse and shining spurs, and \n\n&gt; His white locks waving in the troubled air,/ He stands - he draws the weapon to his eye - / The sparkles catch the dust - the ruins fly/ To search him through the heart! - but by quick wheel,/ At the brief instant that the hammer'd steel/ Fretted with fire, his death, Tecumseh shunn'd\n\nJohnson's run for office drew a lot of attention and a lot of corroboration of his story from veterans, who continued penning affidavits and accounts that more or less supported Johnson's role in the battle until at least the 1860s. But other men also represented that they had slain the man. David King, a private in a company of Kentucky cavalry and a volunteer of the forlorn hope, claimed that he had shot an Indian close to where Tecumseh's body had been found, and had remembered it on account the man's fine dress and leggings, which, when he returned later, he hoped to loot from the corpse.\n\nStill another man, William Whitley, was put forward as the killer on account that he had been witnessed by another soldier \"aiming at an Indian who was said to be Tecumthe\" and that, later, the man's rifle was found empty. Whitley had been killed, and could not personally press his claim, of course.\n\nAnd then there are a fair number of others all credited, with varying levels of support. \n______________\n\ncharacter limit, more below.",

        "&gt; This is changing soon, as a new plant based imitation meat will be coming to stores and lab grown meats in the near future will start to replace cattle and leave more space for growing food.\n\nPlant based imitation meat and lab grown meat are gaining traction alarmingly slowly. Meat consumption rates in america are still rising; in fact [2018 was an all time record for per capita meat consumption in America](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/americans-meat-consumption-set-to-hit-a-record-in-2018/).\n\n&gt; How exactly is America eating meat harming poor regions (for example: Africa of SE Asia)? The vast majority of meat consumed in the US was grown in the US. How does that harm poor countries? Also, \"The US is the largest contributing country to food aid in the world. Over 3 billion people, or 40% of the world\u2019s population, have been recipients of US food aid in more than 150 countries over the past 60 years.\u00a0That's 3 billion people who've benefitted from food assistance since 1949.\u00a0In 2015, the US helped train 9 million farmers and improve nutrition for 18 million children, globally\" (source).\n\nMost meat being produced domestically is still harmful to poor regions. No matter where the meat is being produced, it\u2019s still wasting food. It still helps to drive food prices out of the reach of the poorest people. From a profit standpoint, it makes sense to choose rich Americans with meat loving taste buds over those that are starving. But it doesn\u2019t make it morally right. \nThat 3 billion figure is comprised of people who have eaten a single meal from USAID; it\u2019s not like the US is literally constantly feeding 3 billion people. My number crunch from earlier showed that with the US foreign aid budget we couldn\u2019t even consistently feed 1/3 of the people that we\u2019re indirectly responsible for starving. \n\n&gt; USAID has also been helpful with stabilizing countries and slowly turning them into democracies (sources: here, here, and here). \n\nAgain, the amount of US aid is simply not even close to enough to offset the food that it wastes for nothing other than a taste. Aid packages may help to stabilize countries, but inflated food prices due to unnecessary scarcity destabilizes countries. \n\n&gt; I also forgot to mention how America has been fighting against deadly diseases, mainly Neglected Tropical Diseases (look them up and click images for instant nightmares). The US \"distributes 300 million treatments annually, reaching 743 million people with 1.6 billion NTD treatments across 31 countries to date\" (source). The US has also been helping fight the global AIDS epidemic and has helped fight the Ebola epidemic as well as saved millions of children from Malaria and fighting the Zika virus, and funding new innovations to fight disease outbreaks such as using GMO mosquitoes to eradicate malaria.\n\nUSAID has been helping to fight diseases directly, there\u2019s no denying that. However, a more effective way to fight disease is indirectly, by ensuring a more nourished population. Take a look at [this](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_disease). In the article, there\u2019s a graph that shows the number of years lost per 100,000 people due to disease. If you compare northern South America to northern sub saharan Africa, you\u2019ll see that diseases are hurting the latter much more. However, many of the countries in this African region, like Chad, Niger, and Mali, are mostly in the Sahara desert. This makes these places much more inhospitable to insects that transmit these diseases than a country like Peru in the Amazon ([source showing that mosquitoes are more widespread in South America](https://elifesciences.org/articles/08347). However, as shown by that graph, tropical diseases are much less prevalent in South America. The reason for this is revealed in the fact that [NTDs in South America primarily effect the poor](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2553488/#idm140043303166112title). The malnourished poor could potentially not be getting the nutrients they need to fight diseases. Also, since they\u2019re paying an inflated amount for food, a price increase greatly attributed to the wastefulness of livestock, less money goes to vaccines and other disease preventative methods. More people live in poverty in sub saharan Africa than South America. Therefore, it makes sense that disease is more prevalent in the African region, despite the climate being generally harsher to insect vectors of disease transmission. \n\n\n&gt; What is the problem with opening up countries to the markets? Botswana is one of Africa's wealthiest nations because of this (especially when compared to Zimbabwe), and other examples can be seen not only in Botswana ,but in South Korea, Chile, and China. Foreign investment helps develop countries. America also doesn't only give out food (see my previous links about fighting disease, as well as providing clean water and education).\n\nLoans to developing countries come with strings attached. Not only is [half of foreign aid given only for developing countries to use on products from the donor nations](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/sep/02/as-a-system-foreign-aid-is-a-fraud-and-does-nothing-for-inequality), but these aid loans come with interest, [indebting these countries to rich creditor countries like the US](http://www.cadtm.org/Developing-country-debt-payments). Paying these loans back obviously involves exports, and the quickest, easiest way to get money from exports is by exporting raw materials. However, raw material extraction is significantly worse for the environment than manufacturing jobs in the developed world that use these raw materials ([raw material emissions ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/phys.org/news/2019-03-raw-materials-global-emissions.amp) vs. [manufacturing emissions](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.CO2.MANF.ZS)). All of those countries you mentioned have major pollution problems ([Botswana](http://www.journalhealthpollution.org/doi/full/10.5696/2156-9614-7.15.8), [Chile](https://www.efe.com/efe/english/technology/pollution-worsens-in-chilean-capital/50000267-3687218), [South Korea](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_of_South_Korea#Air_pollution), [China](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution_in_China)). The US used to have a terrible pollution problem as well; [Lake Erie caught on fire in the late 60s ](https://www.environmentalcouncil.org/when_our_rivers_caught_fire). However, tragedies like this and Love Canal essentially forced politicians to enact environmental legislation to avoid backlash. That\u2019s when US industries simply decided to outsource their pollution to the global south, which they are doing to this day.\n\n&gt; oligopoly\n\n[ol-i-gop-uh-lee]\n\nnoun\n\nthe market condition that exists when there are few sellers, as a result of which they can greatly influence price and other market factors. \n\n\nSounds like the US to me. Industries ranging from [cell service providers](https://www.statista.com/statistics/199359/market-share-of-wireless-carriers-in-the-us-by-subscriptions/), [social media](https://www.statista.com/statistics/265773/market-share-of-the-most-popular-social-media-websites-in-the-us/), [the conventional media](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_of_media_ownership), [agriculture](https://www.newamerica.org/weekly/122/consolidation-is-eating-our-food-economy/), and many, many, MANY more industries in the US are split between a very small amount of corporations in each sector. However, unless these oligopolies are directly supported by the law, like with the prescription drug act cutting small business out of the pharma market by placing costly barriers in the way, it is very possible to start a small business in one of these industries. Nowhere in the definition of oligarchy is rule solely by the elite a criterion. But significantly disrupting the market share as a small business is a long shot, as shown by the general trend of big business to get even [bigger](https://www.vox.com/2018/11/26/18112651/monopoly-open-markets-institute-report-concentration). Many US industries are controlled by a few sellers with great influence over the market, making the US an oligarchy. \n\n\n",

        "The Iroquoians of Huronia\n\nDuring the 15th and early 16th centuries, warfare in the Northeast culture area fostered the creation of extensive political and military alliances. It is generally believed that this period of increasing conflict was instigated by internal events rather than by contact with Europeans; some scholars suggest that the region was nearing its carrying capacity. Two of the major alliances in the area were the Huron confederacy (which included the Wendat alliance) and the Five Tribes (later Six Tribes), or Iroquois Confederacy. The constituent tribes of both blocs spoke Iroquoian languages\n\nThe Huron were a relatively tight alliance of perhaps 20,000\u201330,000 people who lived in rather dense settlements between Hudson Bay and the St. Lawrence River, an area thus known as Huronia. This was the northern limit at which agriculture was possible, and the Huron grew corn (maize) to eat and to trade to their Subarctic Indian neighbours\u2014the Innu to the north and east and the Cree to the west\u2014who provided meat and fish in return. The Huron confederacy is believed to have coalesced in response to raids from other Iroquoians and to have migrated northward to escape pressure from the Five Tribes to their south and southeast. Although the Huron coalition\u2019s major goal was defense, the strength of the alliance also helped them to maintain trading, rather than raiding, relationships with the Innu, the Cree, and later the French.  \n\nThe Five Tribes of the Iroquois Confederacy lived south of the St. Lawrence River and Lake Erie, for the most part in the present-day state of New York. The alliance comprised the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca peoples; the Tuscarora joined the confederacy later. Evenly matched with the Huron alliance in terms of aggregate size, the Iroquois were more loosely united and somewhat less densely settled across the landscape. While the Huron nations traded extensively for food, this was less the case for the Five Tribes, who relied more thoroughly upon agriculture. Before colonization they seem to have removed southward, perhaps in response to raids from the Huron to their north. The alliances among the Five Tribes were initiated not only for defense but also to regulate the blood feuds that were common in the region. By replacing retributory raids among themselves with a blood money payment system, each of the constituent nations was better able to engage in offensive and defensive action against outside enemies.\n\n-Blood feuds in tribal societies is basically \"you killed x, we must get equal justice.\" Neighboring tribes coexisted for generations having fought each other before. \"Tributes\" to settle blood feuds ranged from turning a member/s in to be executed, to gifts, to arrange marriages.\n\nThe Northeast was crisscrossed by an extensive series of trade routes that consisted of rivers and short portages. The Huron used these routes to travel to the Cree and Innu peoples, while the Iroquois used them to travel to the Iroquoians on the Atlantic coast. The French claimed the more northerly area and built a series of trade entrep\u00f4ts at and near Huron communities, whose residents recognized the material advantages of French goods as well as the fortifications\u2019 defensive capabilities. The Huron alliance quickly became the gatekeeper of trade with the Subarctic, profiting handsomely in this role. Its people rapidly adopted new kinds of material culture, particularly iron axes\n\nFor a period of time the new weapons enabled the Huron confederacy to gain the upper hand against the Iroquois, who did not gain access to European goods as quickly as their foes. By about 1615 the long traditions of interethnic conflict between the two alliances had become inflamed, and each bloc formally joined with a member of another traditional rivalry\u2014the French or the English. Initially the Huron-French alliance held the upper hand, in no small part because the French trading system was in place several years before those of the Dutch and English. The indigenous coalitions became more evenly matched after 1620, however, as the Dutch and English trading system expanded. These Europeans began to make guns available for trade, something the French had preferred not to do. The Huron found that the technological advantage provided by iron axes was emphatically surpassed by that of the new firearms.  \n\na smallpox epidemic killed as many as two-thirds of the Huron alliance in 1634\u201338... beavers, the region\u2019s most valuable fur-bearing animals, had been over-hunted to the point of extinction in the home territories of both groups. The Iroquois blockaded several major rivers in 1642\u201349, essentially halting canoe traffic between Huronia and the Subarctic. The combination of smallpox, the collapse of the beaver population, and the stoppage of trade precipitated an economic crisis for the Huron, who had shifted so far from a subsistence economy to one focused on exchange that they faced starvation. Decades of intermittent warfare culminated in fierce battles in 1648\u201349, during which the Iroquois gained a decisive victory against the Huron and burned many of their settlements. In 1649 the Huron chose to burn their remaining villages themselves, some 15 in all, before retreating to the interior.\n\n-Iroquois went expansionary for that French beaver money.\n\nHaving defeated the Huron confederacy to their north and west, the Iroquois took the Beaver Wars to the large Algonquin population to their north and east, to the Algonquian territory to their west and south, and to the French settlements of Huronia. They fought the alliances of these parties for the remainder of the 17th century, finally accepting a peace agreement in 1701. With both the Huron and the Iroquois confederacies having left Huronia, mobile French fur traders took over much of the trade with the Innu and Cree, and various bands of Ojibwa began to enter the depopulated region from their original homelands to the south of the Great Lakes.

        "What is RSS? -- MUST READ!  \n \n\nRashtriya  Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) is an extremist group founded in 1925 by Keshav  Baliram Hedgewar as a movement against British rule in India and a  response to rioting between Hindus and Muslims. Upon Hedgewar\u2019s death,  leadership of the group was assumed by Madhava Sadashiv Golwalkar.   Golwalkar openly admired Adolf Hitler and his ideas on preserving the  purity of a race. A major emphasis is placed on dedication and  discipline, both mental and physical, to restore strength, valor, and  courage in Hindus. After Mahatma Gandhi's assassination in January 1948  by a former member of the RSS, many prominent leaders of the RSS were  arrested, and RSS as an organization was banned in India.  RSS main  ideology is that Hindu culture is the only indigenous culture of India.  It is a hardline Hindu nationalist organization believes in supremacy of  Hindu religion and race over other religions. The Christian, Muslim,  Dalit as well as Sikh communities have been the targets of carefully  orchestrated cultural and religious genocide.  \n How is RSS working against Sikhs?  \n  The best way for someone to destroy a religion is to infiltrate it. RSS  uses fake saints, false living Gurus like Radha Swami, Nirankaris, and  Dera Saccha Sauda. The RSS has setup this network of agents to mislead  unsuspecting Sikhs away from their true Guru.  These groups and  individuals are given billions in financing every year to spread their  mission of misinformation and propaganda against Sikhism. We must stop  thinking on the surface and dig deeper. These people will not be wearing  orange robes, they will be DISGUISED as SIKHS.   \n I would like to  draw your attention to the Civil Rights movement and a popular character  known as the \u201cHouse Slave\u201d. House slaves ate better food and had better  clothes than field slaves they were more comfortable. They forgot that  they were slaves, they felt like they were part of the family. Civil  Rights activists used this term to refer to African Americans who would  rather be comfortable as a blind slave to society instead of  understanding themselves and being free.   \n In many ways RSS is doing  the same to Sikhs and Punjabi Culture. Punjabis have become comfortable  being Punjabis rather than Sikhs. Sikh traditions have been hijacked.  Bhangra was derived from an important martial art training of Gatka.  Now, bhangra music is full of lust, drugs and alcohol. A tradition that  was supposed to help fight to keep integrity to protect our faith, is  destroying it. The Sikh has become a caricature, one that often plays a  fool or an idiot in films. Punjab used to be the richest part of India  and now we are the poorest. This is a result of systemic efforts to  weaken the Sikh population. This is no simple attack this is a genocide  on the Sikh Religion.   \n Black America\u2019s house negro is similar to the  mentality of the modern Punjabi Sikh. We are happy to live in western  society, but they have no clue about what their religion stands for. 80  to 100 years ago the Gurdwara was a place of learning. Sikhs used to be  the Kings of India now we are only associated with being outlandish,  loving chicken and binging alcoholics. We used to stand for integrity  and service to our community, now many say we commit crimes in their  country and help to smuggle narcotics. Punjab was an agricultural wonder  but now it is ridden with drugs and crime  \n Now, this article is NOT  meant to demotivate us, or to validate any of these ideologies. It\u2019s to  WAKE US UP! Why have we wandered down this path? What is slowly chipping  away at something we once were proud of and knew was perfect? Where is  this doubt coming from?   \n I would like to reiterate these are NOT  direct attacks, this is subtle, and you must really think deeply on what  our religion stands for. The only way it is possible to be a Sikh  physically and mentally is through discipline and self-reflection.  EARNING SIKHI is not easy but the reward you get is priceless. Our life  has become about convenience and the easy way out. What values does that  leave us with?  \n RSS waters down Sikhism, the aim to market Hindu  beliefs under Sikhism to undermine our faith.  They will not want you to  change for the better, rather have the whole religion follow others  blindly. They want us as far as possible from the Truth in Gurbani that  our Gurus have left for us. Legitimate Sikh groups are often sidelined  and threatened while undercover RSS agents enjoy police protection and  full support. Now RSS has started sending and encouraging these false  preachers to branch out to outside countries too. The break down and  twist Gurbani to mislead Sangat. They will stand next to our Satguru but  also contradict it at the same time.   \n OUR GURUS DID NOT LEAVE SRI GURU GRANTH SAHIB AS A PLACEHOLDER, IT IS THE GUIDE AND IT IS THE JUDGE!  \n  RSS agents are sent to Canada and America dressed as Sikhs to influence  preaching and Sikh Culture in the west. Yogi bhajan and 3HO is a  similar example. The mixture of Sikh and Hindu practices in the 3HO  organization has led to confusion on what true Sikh beliefs are. Idol  worship, empty rituals and breathing exercises are not a part of  Sikhism. They will twist lines from Gurbani to lie to us and encourage  Sikhs to follow people, not their scripture. Yogi Bhajan has numerous  scandals involving sexual misconduct. These yogic meditations and  exercises are not written in Gurbani. Meditation is a key part of Sikh  lifestyle; however, many preachers will use spiritual material outside  Gurbani to preach.   \n They start using their own thinking, and in turn  can always be influenced but outside sources who can influence them  with money. Politicians make their living from donations, this affects  their views and how they practice. Same with preachers, if someone is  being paid to preach, they will preach what gets them paid. Guess what,  some of them get paid by RSS.   \n They have people on different media  outlets who will use their position to write articles that are against  Sikhi. Keep in mind these are not direct verbal attacks but more of a  subliminal message to weaken our core values as a religion. RSS wants  Sikhs to rely more on Punjabi Culture than their religious identity. RSS  has brainwashed Sikhs into believing that their Punjabi culture of  drinking alcohol and eating meat is more important than their religion.  Many have forgot what it means to have the true value and identity of a  Sikh.   \n RSS also has ways to control the media, in that way they are controlling how Sikhs practice their religion.  [https://www.sportsnet.ca/\u2026/hockey-night-punjabi-representa\u2026/](https://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/hockey-night-punjabi-representation/?fbclid=IwAR05WM7bVnYtHWsjRW0Znpl1MIrQXLYeZSrKjPhh6vRB5mvsMbF5soHQd7Y)  \n  This article written says that too many turbans and beards is not  representative of the Punjabi population. It destroys the importance of  being Kesadhari and shows how RSS thinking has infiltrated Sikhism. This  promotes self-hating Sikhs, Sikhs that hate their own identity. Once we  do not like our own identity what will happen to it?   \n RSS wants to  promote an environment where Sikhs are fighting Sikhs. Sikhs are  distracted by entertainment, alcohol and drugs. They want to hijack our  religion and create their own version of Sikhi by redefining the message  of our Guru. Will you let them?   \n \n\nWhat can we do to stop RSS?  \n  Share information with your friends. Listen carefully not blindly. When  someone says something against Sikhi, question it. Do not stay silent,  the longer we stay silent the more damage that will be done. What our  Gurus died will be wasted.   \n \n\nSource:   \n [https://www.britannica.com/topic/Rashtriya-Swayamsevak-Sangh](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.britannica.com%2Ftopic%2FRashtriya-Swayamsevak-Sangh%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR0-h7qZ1me9nWWMgHRaGRR2zEDgDR5B-QYxTY5YbgzPc3ejufg2Yx4UkyU&amp;h=AT3aNVPZQ3-55sP1LKJqlDLXydzUjx2vZ5kwTx01PXfiycII9nffjih1XmeNMSxXkoBtIlsXVfzzKYCDX5DhzE0pBkdNgCDmr-mWgr9pCx0DQXlEpaJw7pbI_dt028Sn)  \n [http://www.searchsikhism.com/refuting-rashtriya-sikh-sangat](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.searchsikhism.com%2Frefuting-rashtriya-sikh-sangat%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR2ItFuBFy0fp0Q_T1bkJSuLg9-6orf2sFuv3tgpl5Ma1ZhfHoelhrqFb18&amp;h=AT20Yus0z-vBT2fCuC1G2swdiLt1mnvLHicsuvR1RVhYvBXARYU56pS5meBN1wxdvKEWis5w9us2XohJF-qdybi5uxx486fYmnyhrTJfvMYSMf5lC6vG1Z3HCfbBnn1M)  \n [http://panthic.org/articles/2683](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fpanthic.org%2Farticles%2F2683%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR1YwaDjVKTK71xdYMj91jlNIHuHs9U-1UNP2x8sNvNIybtfuAzbQCO4H9k&amp;h=AT0RWWlEux0Uqzlb0cWqLFbFy0c7VMpThMXwQgSElx-mP0ElKmd7-i9XvrEZD4KNa6aVGmfdE-amIaEQVq3xUZRjS1gH6N01nO1GFxSR4zqIv7ZevOMyvCtmdlmFCA1w)",

        "After a work-related hiatus of a few weeks I'm back with this week's random postal code: [Aylmer, Ontario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aylmer,_Ontario)!\n\nLocated inland of Lake Erie about 30km southeast of London, Aylmer is home to approximately 7,600 people\n\nArcheological evidence shows First Nation habitation of the region stretching back at least 10,000 years. Identified FN include Ottawa, Iroquoius, and Chippewa peoples, the latter 2 more present at the time of European contact. There may also have been a small Petun presence at the time farming tobacco. While the Chippewa are noted for signing detailed treaties with Europeans specifying terms of access the fairness of treaties with the Iroquois remain contentious to this day, with the Iroquois maintaining Europeans have greatly overreached what was agreed upon.\n\nThe first European-descended settler to take up residence in what would become Aylmer was an American immigrant in 1817 who would go on to develop the site and sell village lots in 1830 around a new general store. The town was named after Lord Aylmer, then Governor-in-Chief of British North America in 1835. Mills sprung up along Catfish Creek and agricultural canning and marketing became prominent industries, aided by both proximity to Lake Erie and the new Canada Air Line Railway servicing the village, which incorporated as a town in 1887.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Air Force established a training facility just north of Aylmer in 1941 which would remain in operation until its closure in 1961, at which point the facility became the Ontario Police College which still operates there. The town was also a hub for tobacco production until the closure of the Imperial Tobacco plant in 2007, with the facility being turned into the Elgin Innovation Centre in 2010 for a variety of industrial incubator uses.\n\nPolitical news from Aylmer!\n\n* [Local news in Aylmer and other communities has taken a hit](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/ricter-web-printing-winding-down-print-operations-1.4941590) with the announcement that a Brantford plant that supplies the print operations for several local papers - including the Aylmer Express - will be closing its doors. This continues the trend of reducing options available to local papers with one executive saying choices for printing facilities have declined over 30 year from 15-20 to 4 today.\n* [Speaking of the Aylmer Express, recently the publisher and editor of the paper were acquitted of charges of obstructing police operations.](http://aylmerexpress.com/2018/10/express-journalists-acquitted/) This comes in the wake of an OPP operation to recover a body from a vehicle submerged in Lake Erie in June 2017 with the OPP alleging the journalists arrived on the scene and interfered with the recovery efforts. Justice Glen Arnold agreed the journalists did interfere but it wasn't done willfully because police did not explain what was going on at the scene. The acquittal comes despite the defense calling no witnesses, relying only on written submissions.\n* In positive economic news for the town recently [Air Liquide announced it will soon open a newly-built CO2 recovery plant in the town](https://globalnews.ca/news/4589729/air-liquide-plant-aylmer/). The facility will be involved in fabrication and food production. \n* [Last year Aylmer council voted to keep its own separate police force as opposed to converting to the OPP.](https://www.stthomastimesjournal.com/2017/07/28/aylmer-police-staying-put/wcm/1df1ad5f-17cf-9f25-a3cd-80493e0d7a51) The discussion started as a cost-saving measure but was terminated when it was discovered that the current facilities were not up to OPP standards and a new station house would cost $6 million, money then-mayor Greg Currie said the town didn't have.\n* [The Elgin region is responding to the opioid epidemic and other drug use with the creation of a mobile health unit to provide clean needles to drug users.](https://www.stthomastimesjournal.com/news/local-news/health-unit-starts-mobile-outreach-service) The unit will also be equipped with Naloxone in the event of opioid overdose and be staffed by nurses and harm reduction workers.\n* And it wouldn't be a Localized Disturbance without mentioning marijuana. [Aylmer is getting in on the production game like so many other covered municipalities](https://lfpress.com/news/local-news/london-area-marijuana-producer-weedmd-strikes-export-deal-with-australian-firm), with local producer WeedMD recently completing an international export deal to Australia's first licensed medical marijuana grower. \n\nAnd a look at politicians serving Aylmer:\n\n* The mayor of Aylmer is Mary French. French came to power this past October during the most recent municipal election, defeating sole rival Ann Laur (a town councilor) 911 votes to 545. French was previously deputy mayor for Aylmer. Previous mayor Greg Currie did not re-offer, instead winning election as Councilor to Elgin County.\n* The MPP for Elgin-Middlesex-London is [Jeff Yurek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Yurek) for the Ontario Progressive Conservatives. First elected in 2011 after flipping the riding from the Liberals, Yurek won re-election in 2014 and 2018 by comfortable margins, taking \\~45% and \\~55% of the vote respectively. Prior to entering politics Yurek was a pharmacist and sponsored a unanimously-adopted private member's bill after his election allowing students to carry lifesaving medicines on their person after a student died while his puffer was locked in a principal's office. Yurek was appointed Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry following the election of Doug Ford and was shuffled to Minister of Transportation last month. [Yurek was most recently in the news as being on board a leg of Ford's controversial private jet trip across Northern Ontario.](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-ontario-pc-party-to-pay-for-doug-fords-25000-private-jet-trip/)\n* The MP for the federal riding of Elgin-Middlesex-London is [Karen Vecchio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Vecchio) of the Conservative Party of Canada. First elected in 2015 with 49% of the vote despite a surging Liberal challenger, Vecchio takes over from long-serving Conservative MP Joe Preston after his retirement from federal politics to vie for (and win) mayorship of the town of St. Thomas. Prior to entering politics Vecchio was a coffee shop owner in London before joining Preston's team as an executive assistant. She also holds a certificate from Georgian College from their dental assistant program. Vecchio currently serves as Shadow Minister for Families, Children, and Social Development. Vecchio hasn't been in the news much but is probably most prominently remembered for [her declaration that she has experienced sexual harassment and intimidation on Parliament Hill and witnessed the same directed at female colleagues.](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/karen-vecchio-harassment-parliament-hill-1.4384463)",

        "Why do you need Turian Soldier? If you just want soldier - pick human soldier.

        "&gt; CLEVELAND \u2014 It\u2019s an unseasonably warm Saturday night, and there does not appear to be great urgency for Cavaliers fans to rush in and watch this preseason game against the Celtics.\n\n&gt; Cleveland star Kevin Love will not play, Celtics All-Stars Gordon Hayward and Kyrie Irving are not even here, and the game does not even count. But none of that matters to the man in the black sweatshirt and black hat who is sitting in a front-row seat under a basket.\n\n&gt; He records some of the pregame festivities on his iPhone. He texts his family members to tell them about his great seat.\n\n&gt; Then, about 10 minutes before tipoff, Celtics point guard Terry Rozier walks over and wraps the man in a hug. The two have been waiting and talking about this moment for years, because Terry Rozier Sr. has spent all but nine months of his 24-year-old son\u2019s life in prison. This is the first time he has ever seen him play a basketball game in person.\n\n&gt; \u201cI\u2019ve been admiring the young man my son has become,\u201d Rozier Sr. said in an interview with the Globe. \u201cHe\u2019s just like me in a lot of ways, but he\u2019s also so much different. He\u2019s a better man than I was.\u201d\n\n&gt; **Losing a father**\n\n&gt; Terry Rozier Sr. wants to make it clear that he is not seeking, nor does he feel he deserves, any sympathy. He understands he has made mistakes.\n\n&gt; He is not a soldier returning home to see his son play basketball for the first time. He is seeing his son play basketball for the first time because he has been incarcerated for committing violent crimes.\n\n&gt; Less than two months after Terry Jr. was born on March 17, 1994, his father was arrested for aggravated robbery and ultimately sentenced to eight years in prison. He was released when Terry was 9, and the two tried to make up for lost time.\n\n&gt; The elder Rozier taught his son to box and fish. They\u2019d play football and basketball. Terry still calls it the best summer ever.\n\n&gt; But on July 27, 2003, that was all taken away. The elder Rozier and three friends lured a couple to a home to purchase car rims and robbed them. While one of the victims was held at gunpoint, he fought back and the gun discharged, killing one of Rozier\u2019s accomplices, a 17-year-old boy.\n\n&gt; Because a person was killed during a crime, Rozier and his two other friends were charged with murder. They ultimately pled guilty to kidnapping and robbery, with a reduced charge of involuntary manslaughter, and in 2005 Rozier was sentenced to 13 years in prison.\n\n&gt; He watched his son\u2019s basketball career blossom from a distance, as Terry Jr. progressed from Shaker Heights High School to the University of Louisville to a 2015 first-round draft pick of the Celtics.\n\n&gt; The father and son talked to each other about once a week. The younger Rozier said he was never mad at his father. He just wanted him to remain in his life, and there is nothing the father wants more.\n\n&gt; \u201cI\u2019ve been admiring my son, how he\u2019s able to change his outcome considering where we come from,\u201d Rozier Sr. said. \u201cHis poise, attitude, heart, demeanor, determination, I\u2019ve watched all that grow while I was in prison. Sometimes I\u2019d be talking to him and have to look at the phone and remember this is my little son right here. He\u2019s got his mind all the way together.\u201d\n\n&gt; **A fresh start**\n\n&gt; The week before Rozier Sr. was released from the Lake Erie Correctional Institution on Aug. 6, he was too excited to sleep. He\u2019d watch TV and pace around his cell. He thought about what he would do on his first day of freedom, and then he started thinking about the second day, and then the third.\n\n&gt; The younger Rozier picked up his father in a large van when he was released. First, they met other family members at a Youngstown cemetery where the elder Rozier\u2019s mother was buried in 2007. Rozier Sr. had never been to her gravesite.\n\n&gt; Then Terry took his father to buy clothes and sneakers, and they went to their favorite Youngstown pizza parlor. It was perfect.\n\n&gt; Rozier Sr. got a job at an industrial cleaning service, where he sometimes works 12-hour shifts going to places such as factories, mills, and warehouses. His son bought him a modest house in Boardman, Ohio, a suburb south of Youngstown. It is far enough away from the tumultuous life the father left behind, but close enough that it does not feel unfamiliar. He has a porch and a yard, and he is looking forward to getting some new furniture soon.\n\n&gt; He has enjoyed wearing nice clothes again and eating at whatever time he wants to eat. Most of all, he is glad to reconnect with his family and meet his grandchildren and to finally see his son play in the NBA in person, rather than on a television in a prison.\n\n&gt; **\u2018A true blessing\u2019**\n\n&gt; About a week before Saturday\u2019s game in Cleveland, Terry Rozier smiled and said how excited he was to have his father see him play.\n\n&gt; \u201cI\u2019ve thought about it a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about it for years.\u201d\n\n&gt; But as the day drew closer, Terry became more closed off publicly. He said he just wanted to get through the day, and on Saturday made it clear he did not want to say much about it.\n\n&gt; Behind the scenes, though, his excitement was evident. He called his father three times on Saturday, the last to tell him he had purchased him a courtside seat.\n\n&gt; The father settled into Section 1, Seat 4, Row VIP, two seats down from Sports Illustrated swimsuit model Kate Bock, who is Kevin Love\u2019s girlfriend.\n\n&gt; In the first quarter the father used his phone to take videos of his son in action. Just 80 seconds into the game, Rozier spun through the lane for a layup, and his father smiled. Terry seemed well-aware of his special guest and perhaps even anxious, as he took eight first-quarter shots, twice as many as anyone else in the game.\n\n&gt; \u201cI can\u2019t even explain this feeling right here,\u201d Rozier Sr. said at halftime from his courtside seat. \u201cTo be looking at my son, and be on the floor, too? I can\u2019t even explain it. I\u2019m just so happy. I\u2019m so proud of him. This is a true blessing.\u201d\n\n&gt; After the final buzzer, Terry Rozier shook hands with a few Cavaliers and then made a beeline toward his dad to give him his No. 12 jersey.\n\n&gt; About a half-hour later, Rozier\u2019s friends and family waited for him in the lower level of the ara. Rozier\u2019s father had his son\u2019s game-worn jersey draped over his shoulder, and he pointed out that it was still wet, and that he could not wait to frame it.\n\n&gt; When Terry emerged from the tunnel he hugged his father and asked him if he had enjoyed himself. Of course he had enjoyed himself.\n\n&gt; \u201cWait until you come up for a Boston game,\u201d the point guard said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be even more fun.\u201d\n\n&gt; Because he in on probation, Rozier Sr. cannot leave Ohio until Oct. 24, but after that, Boston will be one of his first stops.\n\n&gt; As Terry headed back toward the Celtics\u2019 locker room, an arena security guard told the family that it was time for everyone to go. The night was over. But for the father, this goodbye was much different than the others.",

        "If you plan on walking everywhere, that somewhat limits your options.  Obviously you will be around E. 4th St., which is a major entertainment district, and has plenty of restaurants and bars to wet your whistle.\n\n**Inside of Walking Distance**\n\nIf you are looking for a nice, sit down dinner, I would direct you towards Lola, Greenhouse Tavern, or Chinato.  For lunch, I would recommend Mabel's BBQ - its quick and delicious.  Barrio would also be highly recommended for lunch, however lines/waits could get excessive.\n\nIf you are looking for a drink along 4th St., Butcher and the Brewer is a craft brewery with good appetizers.  Corner Ally would also be recommended for high end bowling.  Some will direct you to Society Lounge.  I tend to steer guests away for multiple reasons, but I try to keep posts positive.  I also advocate for Greenhouse Tavern rooftop bar, assuming weather is decent enough.  Taco Bell Cantina is also right around the corner for your late night fix and a night cap.\n\nIf you are looking for some great photo opps/architecture, you will love the 4th St. Arcade (first modern indoor mall).  Heinen's downtown also has a beautiful rotunda.  There are 2 breath taking churches, The Old Stone Church and the Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist.  Lastly, I would direct you towards the Fountain of Eternal Life, and then over to Public Square.\n\nThe JACK Casino is also nearby, but its not your typical Casino.  Its a repurposed, historic building.  So, instead of a spread open layout with obnoxious decorations, its a 4 floor, condensed, elegant presentation. \n\n**Outside of Walking Distance**\n\nThe East Bank of the Flats is our newest entertainment district.  It has a vast variety of offerings, including a speakeasy nightclub (Magnolia), live music bar (The Big Bang), Margaritaville, Backyard Bocce, Thirsty Dog Brewery, Collision Bend Brewery, Coast Taco (terrible food, fantastic patio), Ally Cat Oyster Bar, and Dante's Carryout (amazing pizza).  You will find some of the most beautiful views in the city here.\n\nIf you are looking for more of a lowkey night, Little Italy/Uptown/University Circle would be a great option.  I recommend Trattoria for dinner, TOLI for a drink, and Corbo's for some delicacies.  This is also near the Cleveland Museum of Art - which has earned a tremendous international reputation.  Wade Oval is a great area that also include Severance Hall - home to the Cleveland Orchestra.  It would make for a fantastic afternoon/evening before hitting some bars downtown.\n\nIf you are into craft beer, check out W. 25th St.  There are about 6 or 7 breweries within a 5 minute walk from each other, along with Western Reserve Meadery and Velvet Tango Room, and a bunch of great places to eat and bars to drink.  W. 25th is also home to the West Side Market, which does not disappoint. \n\n**Misc**\n\nLastly, our Cleveland script signs have become pretty popular.  There are 4 around downtown but would require a 5-10 minute Uber/Lyft.  Edgewater Park (upper park), Tremont, North Coast Harbor (near Rock n Roll Hall of Fame), and the Foundry (along the Cuyahoga River).  I would also check out Playhouse Square and the World's Largest Outdoor Chandelier, along with the State and Capitol Theaters.\n\nIts unfortunate that you aren't visiting in the summer.  Edgewater Live is a great way to spend Thursday night.  The Edgewater Beach House really is a jewel of Cleveland.  It provides great views of the beach and under-appreciated Lake Erie sunsets.\n\nWe will be out and about Friday and if you need any more recommendations or tips, don't hesitate to send me a message.  If you would like more suggestions, help us a little bit more and tell us your interests.  Are you trying to bar hop and stumble back to the hotel or are you looking for lowkey evenings to catch a buzz, but absorb as much of the city as possible.\n\n",

        "There are lots of really nice things to see...depends on what you're into. As far as life-changing, here are a few:\n\n**Cedar Point**\u2014perennially voted as the world's best amusement park. Especially awesome if you enjoy roller coasters. It's only open summer months and a little in late spring and early fall. \n\n**Hocking Hills State Park**\u2014I've been to Yosemite, Yellowstone, Zion, Grand Canyon, and a couple dozen other national parks and I still haven't found anything that has holds the same special magical feeling of Hocking Hills\u2014I'm not saying these natural wonders aren't spectacular and unique in their own ways, they most definitely are, but nothing in or around them makes me feel like I'm in the same type of fantasyland as Hocking Hills. Old Man's Cave makes me feel like I think it would be to visit the Elven city of Rivendell in the Lord of the Rings movies! There's just a certain special \"it\" factor that Hocking Hills has that makes it rank among the best parks in the country in my opinion...I drive the 3 hours it takes to get there from Cleveland usually about twice a year on average to camp and hike my heart out. It's a great 4-season park too\u2014gorgeous fall colors in the hollows, cool ice formations in winter, tons of seasonal waterfalls in the gorges in spring, and lush green forest during the summers.\n\n**Museum of the US Air Force in Dayton**\u2014this rivals the offerings of the National Air &amp; Space Museum at the Smithsonian. There are two solos with ICBMs and other missiles and rockets used in the space program, as well as capsules used during Mercury, Gemini, and I believe Apollo as well. There is also a ginormous hangar full of historical planes as well as replicas of the nuclear bombs dropped in WWII. It's an exceptional place to see the aerospace technology that shaped the 20th Century.\n\n**The Three Cs** in Ohio (Cleveland, Columbus, and Cincinnati) also offer a ton to do, and vary quite a bit in offerings. Lots of people think post-industrial wasteland with a burning river when they think of Cleveland, and they think warm and fuzzy thoughts of college football and stuff like the Columbus Zoo\u2014but honestly Columbus is far less interesting than Cleveland or Cincinnati beyond a handful of things, and Cleveland probably offers the most when it comes to cultural offerings and overall stuff to do (although Cincinnati has the prettiest skyline and offers quite a bit to keep you busy, especially if you include all the stuff on the Kentucky side of the Ohio River). Cleveland and Cincinnati both have exceptional orchestras...the Cleveland Orchestra is an awesome experience at either Blossom Music Center or Severance Hall. We went to see the first Star Wars movie at Blossom and the Cleveland Orchestra played the entire score for the movie live\u2014when you consider they were playing it all *live*, and that they sounded absolutely *perfect*, it was incredible!! University Circle in Cleveland has a huge concentration of museums, including the Cleveland Museum of Art (world-class, and free admission!), Cleveland Botanical Gardens, Museum of Natural History, Crawford Auto &amp; Aviation Museum, and the Cleveland History Museum. There are exceptional restaurants and breweries all around the city, several of which are operated by James Beard Award winners Michael Symon and Jonathan Sawyer. Go to East 4th Street Downtown for the food and West 25th Street in Ohio City for the beer and one of America's oldest public markets. Besides that, Cleveland also has parks along Lake Erie and along the rivers and creeks of the Cleveland Metroparks, as well as bicycle trails throughout and down into the Cuyahoga Valley National Park. You can rent bikes in the little old canal town of Peninsula, ride them however far you'd like, and then ride the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad back to your car. Cleveland also has the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame and the Pro Football Hall of Fame is about an hour or so away in Canton. You can catch a professional ball game of some sort any time of year too. This is just the tip of the iceberg though, there are many more things to do in and around Greater Cleveland (like Amish Country south and east of the city).\n\nCincinnati I am less familiar with, but expect some gorgeous views and bridges along the Ohio River. There are some really cool neighborhoods like Over-The-Rhine and a lot of great little downtowns in the suburbs across the Ohio River, many of which are very walkable. I believe the Cincinnati Zoo is also still considered one of the best in the nation. There's more here, and the city feels like a big city, but I just haven't spent the time exploring it to list off its offerings.\n\nColumbus has stuff to do too, but it is much newer because most of it has grown up in the last 50 years, so it feels way more suburban and much less like a big city than do Cleveland or Cincinnati (I mean, there are skyscrapers and stuff Downtown, but everything is so spread out it doesn't really have the energy of Downtown Cleveland or Cincy). The Columbus Zoo is supposed to be one of the nation's best. The entire city is all about The Ohio State University's football and basketball teams, which are often in contention for national titles. There are a couple of cool neighborhoods like Short North and German Village with interesting bars, restaurants, and shops, though there are quite a few national chains there too.",

        "*Copy / pasta in case someone doesn't want to disable adblocker or cannot click the link.*\n\n\n* **Article**\n\nThe Ralph C. Wilson Jr. Foundation on Wednesday afternoon will announce the largest philanthropic gift ever made in Western New York.\nThe foundation will give $100 million to turn LaSalle Park on Buffalo's Lower West Side into a signature park and to develop a completed regional trail system.\nThe timing is no accident: The $100 million announcement comes on what would have been Ralph C. Wilson Jr.'s 100th birthday.\nDetroit will hear the same news. The Wilson Foundation will announce in Detroit that it will give another $100 million to remake a riverfront park and connect trails in Southeast Michigan.\nThe gifts celebrate Wilson's legacy in the communities that mattered most to him.\n\n\"We are proud and honored to celebrate Ralph's birthday today with a lasting gift that matches in scale the passion and pride he had for his hometown of Detroit and 'adopted' hometown of Buffalo, where he founded and owned the Buffalo Bills,\" said Mary Wilson, Ralph Wilson's widow and a lifetime trustee of the foundation.\n\n\"Ralph was committed to exercise, staying active and enjoying life,\" she said. \"It would make Ralph so happy to see people of all ages enjoying these enhanced parks and trails for years to come.\"\nThe foundation considers boosting parks and trails one of its top priorities.\n\"If you look at both regions and their great progress, it's been very impressive,\" said David O. Egner, the foundation's CEO. \"But the one thing parks and trails do that economic development alone can't is connect people.\n\"It's our hope that by investing in trails and creating a signature park, we can truly make this accessible for every ZIP code, regardless of socioeconomic conditions and race.\"\nGiving both regions $100 million was proposed by Mary Wilson, Ralph's widow and one of four life trustees he hand-picked to oversee the foundation.\n\"Mary Wilson said it needs to be $100 million in both regions,\" Egner said. \"She thought both were important to Mr. Wilson, and on his birthday we should make a statement of this size and caliber.\"\nAs part of the agreement, both parks \u2013 with the expectation of city government approval \u2013 are expected to be renamed Ralph C. Wilson Centennial Park.\nMayor Byron W. Brown said the donation \"will enhance the quality of life for generations of Buffalo residents.\"\n\n* **Most generous donation in WNY philanthropic history**\n\n\nThe grant, according to several veterans of Western New York's philanthropy community, tops the list of the most money ever given at one time.\n\nIn 2016, billionaire bond trader and Amherst native Jeffrey Gundlach committed $42.5 million to the Albright-Knox Art Gallery for its planned expansion project, and he added $10 million the following year.\nIn 2015, Delaware North Chairman Jeremy M. Jacobs gave $30 million to the University at Buffalo School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, bringing his total contributions to the institution to over $50 million.\nIn 2011, an anonymous donor gave UB $40 million. Going back to the early 20th century, John J. Albright gave $1 million to build the art museum that bears his name, about $30 million in today's dollars.\nEgner said the grant needs to be seen in context of what has come before.\n\"The city has been working on LaSalle Park for decades,\" Egner said. \"The state and local municipalities concerned about greenways have been funding the state trailway systems and advocating for more funding for decades as well.\"\n\"So we feel that while this is a large gift, it's made possible because of all of the work that happened before us,\" he said. \"In many respects, we're just amplifying that work.\"\nWilson, who died in March 2014, made it known that proceeds from the Bills sale and a portion of his estate would be used to create the philanthropic foundation.\nThe foundation expects to spend between $1.4 billion and $2 billion on both regions over a 20-year period that ends January 2035.\nWith the announcement, the Wilson Foundation has now committed $220.9 million for projects in Western New York and $221.2 million for projects in Southeastern Michigan.\n\n* **Outside support for park is expected**\n\n\nThe foundation will give $40 million to construct the signature park, with $10 million put into an endowment for park maintenance. It will also give $40 million to connect communities with a completed regional trail system. The other $10 million will be set aside in an endowment for sustaining the trail system.\nThe Wilson Foundation grants are not intended to pay for everything. Seventy percent of the remaining costs for the trails initiatives in Buffalo and Detroit are expected to come from states, municipalities, organizations, businesses and other philanthropies.\nThe foundation expects additional outside support for the parks as well, though it's not yet known how much will be needed.\nGetting others to contribute and participate in the initiatives has been a cornerstone of the sustainable model the foundation has pursued in its three years and 10 months of existence.\nLast month, the foundation gave $6.5 million to complete a trail network from downtown Buffalo to Youngstown, helping fill gaps along the Niagara River Greenway. That includes the longest segment of the project, a 7.4-mile trail from North Tonawanda to Niagara Falls through the Town of Wheatfield.\nThe state's $23 million contribution represents the kind of partnership the Wilson Foundation anticipates in the future.\n\"The pot of dollars we're committing will hopefully be a catalyst to fill those key gaps along the region,\" said J.J. Tighe, who directs the foundation's parks and trails initiative.\nThe other contributions also boost economic activity.\n\"Our $200 million between the two regions will produce a direct economic impact of about $500 million,\" Egner said.\n\n* **LaSalle's transformation**\n\n\nThe decision to turn LaSalle Park, the city's largest waterfront park, into a signature park came during a community-involved process called \"Imagine LaSalle.\"\nOver the summer, a focus group of 22 people from surrounding neighborhoods selected by the mayor's administration visited several parks, including Brooklyn Bridge Park in New York City, Maggie Daley Park in Chicago and Washington Park in Cincinnati to draw inspiration.\nNearly 1,200 people filled out surveys offered in seven languages, and youth from the Belle Center were enlisted to take pictures and write about their thoughts on the park. The University at Buffalo's Regional Institute and local organizations and agencies also were involved.\n\"The overall goal is to move forward with a broad conceptual design for the park and work collaboratively with public and private partners to realize that design,\"  Tighe said.\n\"We are also keenly aware that foundations don't build parks; communities build parks,\" Tighe said.\nAfter a design process lasting 12 to 18 months, construction at LaSalle Park could begin as early as 2020, Egner said.\n\"We should have a completed park in the next three to four years,\" Egner said.\nThat would complete a dramatic transformation of land that was a dumping ground through the 1920s.\nCentennial Park, as the park was first called, opened in 1932 after the city leveled, seeded and landscaped the site. The park was renamed for Ren\u00e9-Robert Cavelier Sieur de La Salle, the first European explorer to visit what later became the City of Buffalo.\nThe city has made significant improvements to the park over the past 20 years, and the enhancements will build upon a master plan adopted in 1998 and updated in 2017.\nToday, a picnic shelter, splash pad, pool and playground can be found at the northern end. There are baseball fields and a dog park toward the middle of the park, and a pavilion with lots of open space, a soccer field and more picnic shelters toward the southern end. There are also benches along the waterfront to take in views of Lake Erie and the Niagara River.\nThe park is near five distinct West Side neighborhoods: Front Park, Fargo Estates, Lakeview, Waterfront and Columbus. A 2016 American Community Survey found 15,279 people lived there in 2016, according to census estimates.\nThe foundation expects the park to become a strong regional attraction.\n\n* **Connecting trails and people**\n\n\nThe foundation sees recreation through trail and greenway projects as a way to democratize public space and bring people together.\nTighe, who directs the foundation's parks and trails initiative, formerly led the Michigan Fitness Foundation and the Governor's Council on Physical Fitness, Health and Sports, where he helped develop the Iron Belle Trail Initiative that now stretches 2,000 miles across Michigan.\nThe foundation envisions developing 250 miles of trails in Western New York and Southeast Michigan over the next five to seven years.\nThe trails that could be bolstered include the Shoreline Trail in Erie and Niagara counties, Erie Cattaraugus Rail Trail in Erie and Cattaraugus counties and Genesee Valley Greenway Trail in the Genesee River Valley.\n\"That is enough trails to ride my bike between Detroit and Buffalo,\" Egner said, referring to the distance between the two cities when driving through Canada.",

        "I last visited less than a year ago. I grew up East side, but I'm convinced that the West side is better and a hell of a lot more diverse than the East. The restaurants in the Flats are good (especially Bold), and Tremont/Ohio City has an awesome food scene, and they're making those areas much nicer for those who want gentrified places to go to. The Metroparks in town maintain their green spaces very well, and continuously develop the Emerald Necklace. Edgewater park has indeed gotten a nice facelift after all of that construction and the lighting is much better now for nighttime/dusk walking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYes, Cleveland is striving to do better; yes, there are nice things happening, yes Mitchell's is better than Izzy's any day, and I'll defend the city when someone decides to shit on it for shitting's sake, but Cleveland (and the state of Ohio) has serious issues that can't be plastered over with nice shiny bars, restaurants, and more bars.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPolitical problems\n\n1. Political gerrymandering by the GOP - in 2014, majority voted for Obama, yet Ohio still had 4 Democratic reps out 16 total from the state. (EDIT - Looks like they passed Issue 1. Hope the results work out.)\n2. Active voter purges from Secretary of State Jon Husted.\n3. Having to actually pay to mail in your absentee ballot (MN actually pays for your postage)\n4. City issues, like Cleveland's attempt to raise the minimum wage for city workers to $15, overruled by Columbus and Kaisch - [https://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2016/12/gov\\_john\\_kasich\\_signs\\_bill\\_blo.html](https://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2016/12/gov_john_kasich_signs_bill_blo.html)\n5. Did I mention US Congressional district 2's ghost campaign (granted, this is in Cincinnati)? [https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/06/19/zombie-campaign-congress-giving-democrats-fits/82892598/](https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/06/19/zombie-campaign-congress-giving-democrats-fits/82892598/)\n\nI lean left and am pretty progressive. Ohio is not a progressive's state. And if you have a state government that is actively hostile towards attempts for a city to better itself, you have problems. I sorely want to vote in Ohio's elections to make it a better state, but, well, I guess voter fraud is a widespread thing these days.....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDevelopmental problems:\n\n1. AFAIK, no major new major businesses/corporations have decided to move to or develop out of Cleveland.\n2. In all honesty, despite attempts to improve the city itself, the city has pretty much stagnated in terms of economic growth and development compared to the rest of the country.[https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/newsroom-and-events/press-releases/2017/pr-20170817-clevelands-slow-economic-growth-continues.aspx](https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/newsroom-and-events/press-releases/2017/pr-20170817-clevelands-slow-economic-growth-continues.aspx) (from 8/2017, I sure hope it's gotten better) [https://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2018/09/cleveland\\_economy\\_outpaces\\_cin.html](https://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2018/09/cleveland_economy_outpaces_cin.html) (seems to outpace Cincinnati and Columbus, though, which I guess it's got that going for it)\n\nAnd as much as I love Lake Erie, it's not safe to swim in it, and the vast majority of the lakefront properties are privately owned and are occupied by lakefront condos or houses in contrast to Chicago, Duluth, Buffalo...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, you get the idea. I love Cleveland, because I grew up there, and it has a lot to offer (Cincinnati can go fuck itself and join Kentucky for all I care), but it's not the city (or the state) for me. It's kind of like why people would rather live in buttfucknowhere on 100 acres of land, and not NYC or LA or SF. Or, hell, live in MPLS and not live in NYC. Also, Cleveland is a little bit of a city that got left behind with regards to the rest of the nation\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, perhaps I'm still enjoying the new city smell of of the Twin Cities and really haven't discovered the stupid or crazy shit like I have with Cleveland/Ohio (though we do have some bonkers candidates running for office... and the 2-month wait for drivers license cards to be issued), but for now, I really find it hard to find it in me to really want to return to Cleveland after spending a year here. The city and state really matches my personal preferences with regards to lifestyle, and it's a really happening city. Granted, I miss Lake Erie and quick trips to Canada/Toronto sorely. Probably the biggest shock coming from Ohio is the big money folks who live in MPLS and the ridiculous affluent lifestyle things that exist in some of the stores and areas. It isn't as bad as the coasts, and St. Paul does help to ground the general Twin Cities vibe.",

I'm working with CAD myself and I'm also a gamer. \n\nThe system I'm recommending below is a lot more expensive, but it's actually the bare minimum I'd be comfortable to work with. I've really tried to keep it as cheap as possible.\n\nYou simply need those 6 cores. And you also need those 16 GB of RAM. How are you gonna work on a system with less than 512 GB of storage? Just installing 2 games and some productivity software will bring you to the limit.\n\nA 1600x900 monitor? That's like doing CAD on a bad laptop monitor. The monitor I'm recommending is the cheapest and best option for a serious mix of productivity and gaming.\n\nAnd any CAD worker needs a space mouse. I cannot recommend the small one.

        "So I've been toying around with using circuits and the crafting combinator to control my omnitractors and angels crushers / sorters. I always ran into the problem that I'd have to hard code (via lots and lots of combinators) what ore to work on and in what priority. This annoyed me, so I started working on a design that would take any number of requests (as negative values in a constant combinator) and work on one at a time until the warehouse output (as positive numbers) cancels the request out. It should lock on a product until it's done, rather than flip-flopping around whenever something else had a higher request threshold due to the current one lowering.\n\nThis is what I came up with. It uses a LUA combinator to get the lowest value signal (combined from the constant combinator and warehouse) then stores that in a memory cell which locks it's input whenever it's already storing a signal. When the warehouse positive value cancels out the negative request, the memory is cleared (via pulsed reset) and lock is opened so the next lowest value signal can enter the memory.\n\nWhen initially testing using a pushbutton to reset I'd get a really weird feedback loop in the lock logic, but after switching to the reset circuit it seems to work flawlessly in my testing.\n\nBlueprint (requires the lua combinator mod [here](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/LuaCombinator2)):\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",

        " *\\*gunshot\\**\n\n**1957-65**\n\n**Modello Arrives, Fresh From the Cerveza Plant**\n\nMost of your original Brownies are retired. So you need new talent, a new face for a new generation of Browns. The answer is the, appropriately named, fullback that is Jim Brown. With him you return to the championship\u2026 and lose to the Lions again. Here we go\u2026\n\nMiss the championship by Giants. Miss the playoffs twice. And then\u2026\n\nArt Modell is here now.\n\nThose five words just triggered half of Cleveland and set the river on fire again. Irrational rage fills their hearts as those in the Land of Poe get a strange feeling of arrogant joy.\n\nPossibly.\n\nHowever, cracks are forming between the team and Paul Brown, his winning ways doing nothing to win over his players. This spreads to Modello himself as Brown goes behind his back to trade Bobby Mitchell for the rights to Ernie Davis, the first black Heisman winner, who was diagnosed with leukemia soon after. Brown and Modello fought over him being able to play, despite Davis wanting to do so. But Brown stood firm, and Davis died without playing for the Browns. Take care of him Football Gods.\n\nIt\u2019s the end of an era. Paul Brown. Is gone. The man may have been a football great, but things were strained enough between him and Modello Especial after the Davis debacle. His assistant, Blanton Collier, takes over from here.\n\nThis translates to missing a divisional title in \u201863, but then it happens. Championship glory returns to Cleveland. As underdogs against a Johnny Unitas-led Baltimore Colts, man coverage and Frank Ryan tossing touchdowns to Gary Collins wins the day. Enjoy this championship, Cleveland. Mainly because you lose next year. Vince Lombardi and his Packarena torch you in the second half. This is the last pure NFL championship, as the NFL and AFL (the fourth one) would begin to merge, creating one of the most irritating games of all time: the Super Bowl. Thus, that championship is the last championship of it\u2019s kind.\n\n\\-In time, this game would be nearly forgotten, lost in the middle of Lombardi's great triumphs. ... This was both unfair and fitting in a sense, because the game was best considered on its own, a faded dream played in the mist and slop, a transitory moment between football past and future.\n\n\\-David Maraniss, *When Pride Still Mattered: A Life of Vince Lombardi*\n\n*\\*gunshot\\**\n\n**1966-73**\n\n**Learn the Meaning of Misery, Cleveland**\n\nSo, remember the Jim Brown character? The running back? Well, he has an amatuer acting career, and it\u2019s delayed a bit. Modello threatened to fine him $1,500 a week he was off the practice field. Brown promptly retires. Leroy Kelly is now the big guy on the rush.\n\nUnfortunately, Cleveland, no playoffs in 66. Buuuut, after a realignment the next year, you guys make it in. And lose the conference championship to the Cowboys. And Groza hangs up the cleats. This, is your start of darkness. The beginning of the long descent to the bottom of Lake Erie. And it won\u2019t go as quickly as the Cavs in 2018. This will be a long, hard, *painful* descent. Pack your liquor.\n\n1968! Bill Nelson comes in! Lose to the Colts in the playoffs!\n\n1969! Lose to the Vikings in the last NFL Championship (aka conference game) before the merger! At least they were 12-2\u2026.\n\n1970! You beat Joe Namanth and the Jets opening night and on the very first Monday Night Football broadcast! And beat the team old Paul Brown founded in the Bungles, 30-27! But gave Paul Warfield away. Then lose to the Bungles 14-10 in November. And go 7-7.\n\n1971! Collier is gone thanks to hearing problems. As a 64 year old in that time, it makes sense. Nick Skorch is his replacement. You go 9-5 this year! And lose to the Colts in the divisional.\n\n1972! Mike Phipps (this one guy from Purdue you fired Warfield to Miami for) is starting now! You go 10-4! And lose to Warfield and the Dolphins 20-14. This was the Perfect Season too.\n\n1973. Phipps gives up 20 interceptions for less than half his passes connecting. Have a 7-5-2 record.\n\n*\\*gunshot\\**\n\n**1974-84**\n\n**Who\u2019s this Sipe Guy? And Kardiac Arrest.**\n\n1974. Oh hey. Collier\u2019s back as a QB coach. Of all things. Gene Hickerson is now gone. Leroy Kelly decides to try his hand in this \u2018World Football League\u2019 thing. Surely it will pan out better than the AAFC. And Dick Schafranth has also fucked off. It\u2019s all new guys here now. Need help with brand recognition?\n\n4-10. Jesus.\n\n1975! Skorch is gone! This dude named Forrest Gregg, man of double letters, is his replacement. He used to be a Packers offensive lineman! Perfect for the position! 3-11. But hey! You beat the Bungles again! Once!\n\nOh, and this Brian Sipe character is here too.\n\n1976! You go 9-5!... But miss the playoffs\u2026. But \u2018Turkey\u2019 Jones got to piledrive Terry Bradshaw! Enjoy the rivalry that will totally not turn out one-sided at all, nope nope.\n\n1977! Gregg is now on the wrong side of Modello Especial. But he\u2019s here- for now. Unfortunately newly-minted starter Sipe gets hurt. Dave Mays must come out to play, since Phipps was exiled to the wasteland of Chicago for draft picks. 6-7. Is this what they call subtraction by addition?\n\n1978. Gregg is now gone. Executed by divine order of Modello. An even keeled Saints receivers coach by name of Sam Rutigliano (Italian?) is now the glorious coach. Sipe finds this to be to his liking as 21 touchdowns and nearly 3,000 yards will attest. His favorite targets are Reggie Rucker, a three year vet, and rookie Ozzie Newsome from the mythical land of Alabama. It\u2019s only good enough for 8-8. But at least that Phipps trade got you something\u2026.\n\n1979. Rutgers is now showing his full hand as he begins to really gamble with play calls. Riverboat Sam shows that it can work, but the team gets tacked with the nickname \u2018Kardiac Kids\u2019 after barely scraping a W against the Colts. Your final reward for this Indy Ploy of a season? 9-7. Well, it\u2019s on the *favorable* side of .500\u2026\n\n1980. The magic returns as Sipe breaks Graham\u2019s old passing record and finish 11-5 going into the postseason. The Raiders have come to town, hungry for playoff glory. There\u2019s :56 left on the clock. All you need is a field goal to win. But Cockroft has whiffed it all game. So Rutgers is unwilling to go all in on him. Instead, he calls a play. A play the name of which has gone down in sports infamy, a name which sends tremors of fear and terror and a nicely sized wave of salt from any Cleveland fan who knows their history.\n\nRed Right 88.\n\nSipe passes. Interception. Game over. The Raiders win the Super Bowl that year.\n\n1981. 5. 11. That is all.\n\n1982. You\u2019ve got yourself a strike! Take the opportunity! Sipe and McDonald are split starters, but that doesn\u2019t matter! You do *worse* than last year! 4-5! But hey! You still make the playoffs thanks to the strike! You face the Raiders again! It\u2019s not as dramatic. 27-10.\n\n1983. Sipe\u2019s back in form, but you fail to make the playoffs thanks to blowing a game to the HOUSTON Oilers two weeks before the season ends. Sipe also fucks off to the USFL. Wonder how that works for him.\n\n1984. You know what? You guys don\u2019t have a mascot. Let\u2019s fix that. You get an unofficial one in the Dawg Pound, from Hanford Dixon trying to raise morale on the field by barking and calling the team \u2018the Dogs\u2019. Of all things\u2026.\n\nAnyways, welcome to the basement, Browns! 5-11 again! Rutgers is gone! Marty Schottenwhateverthefuck is here now! **TANK FOR VICTORY, CLEVELAND!**",

        " *\\*gunshot\\**\n\n**1996-8**\n\n**Ded**\n\nYou\u2019re dead. But you have a nice new stadium, a not-so nice new owner in Lerner ($530 million, by the way), with Carmen Policy having a minor 10% stake, a new director in Dwight Clark, and former Sacksonville OC Chris Palmer as head coach. Plus expansion draft and first round pick in the standard draft. Tim Couch is your selection. He will be the ***QB OF THE FUTURE!!!!***\n\nOh, and all that bullshit has been used as a reason to get cities to build teams new stadiums with taxpayer money every few years. So thanks for that, Cleveland.\n\n*\\*gunshot\\**\n\n**1999-2004**\n\n**The Born-Again Browns: Complete Shit**\n\nHere we are. It\u2019s now 1999. The Browns are back. It\u2019s time for Cleveland to once again experience football glory!\n\nSeven straight losses. Starting with the Steelers shutting you out. Hard. Final Record: 2-14.\n\n\\*beer opens, begins pouring\\*\n\n2000. Y2K brings marginal improvement. There\u2019s a new face in Butch Davis, head coach for U of Miami\u2019s football team, as Chris Palmer is executed via guillotine. However, Couch Potato suffers a thumb injury. 3-13.\n\n2001. You are almost there, Cleveland. All you have to do is beat Hashtag Sacksonville at home in week 15, and playoffs are in your future.\n\nIt\u2019s the fourth quarter. Couch makes a pass to Quincy Morgan, who bobbles it, but gets a grip before he hits the ground. Couch kneels to stop the clock, but then the Jaguars challenge the last play. Now, obviously, this is horseshit, since you can\u2019t challenge a outcome after the next play has been snapped, but the refs allow it and overturn the call. This blatant refball bullshit leads to Cleveland fans chucking plastic bottles onto the field, leading the refs to call the game there. But then the commissioner called. The game must end properly. The Jags kneel. 15-10 Sacksonville, 7-9 record. No playoffs.\n\nThus are the events of \u2018Bottlegate\u2019.\n\n2002. Al Lerner is dead. Brain cancer is what kills him at 69. Ownership is now in the hands of his son, Randy. With this motivation the Browns go 9-7 and make the playoffs as a wild card. Only to lose 36-33 as Couch Potato was out with a broken leg, and they had to start the backup. It is still the only playoff game these new Browns have been in.\n\n2003. Hope you enjoyed that progress. It\u2019s gone now. Sink back into Lake Erie as the front office is overhauled.\n\nOh, and 5-11.\n\n2004. At this point I\u2019m already reaching for the bottle. You haven\u2019t played a game, but my expectations are only slightly higher than your current lake depth.\n\n4-12. Davis leaves. I am vindicated.\n\n*\\*gunshot\\**\n\n**2005-12**\n\n**Loading team.exe. Not found.**\n\n2005. Cleveland is resigned to it\u2019s sports misery. The Indians, Cavaliers and Browns ain\u2019t won shit in years. Hockey is only slightly better- they don\u2019t have a team since the Barons died.\n\nBack to the football, Phil Savage is now your GM. This guy worked for your old form in the Land of Poe and was the mastermind behind star draft after star draft. This fuckwit named Romeo Crennel is the new head coach. QB of the future Trent Dilfer is here from Seattle. A future Pro Bowl WR Braylon Edwards is here from the draft. *Nothing can stop you now.*\n\nI stand corrected. 6-10. I fell into expectations. As a matter of fact, your president resigns, though over uproar about him debating over firing Savage.\n\n2006. However this only results in 4-12. Eddie and TE Kellen Winslow Jr. put up respectable numbers, but the points you make are absolute garbage.\n\n2007. 10-6. No playoffs because tiebreakers but that doesn\u2019t matter. Cleveland has something to live for in football again. Mike Keenan is now the new presidente. Don\u2019t Brown this, Cleveland.\n\n2008. What else was I expecting. 4-12 again. Including a six straight loss stretch. Oh, and more joyous news: *STAPH INFECTIONS! \\*AIRHORN\\** Savage and Crennel are out on their asses after the season\u2019s over.\n\n2009. Eric fucking Mangini of the Buttfumble is here for coaching. Winslow is shot off to the hell of Tampa Bay after the idiot crashes his motorcycle. 5-11. All but one of those wins are it\u2019s last four games, however, soooo\u2026. progress?\n\n2010. After a trainwreck of QBs, stud Colt McCoy from the Great State takes the position. RB Peyton Hillis has himself a year and a half. The Browns still go 5-11 and Mangini is out on his ass.\n\n2011. Pat Shurmur is now the head coach. You finish 4-12.\n\nHere\u2019s Mike Polk giving you your name: the Factory of Sadness. See you Sunday.\n\n2012. As it turns out McCoy may be a little broken. Let\u2019s take this Brandon Weeden guy and see how he does if Mickey C ever decides to die on the field. In fact, he starts the first game. And throws four interceptions and has no touchdowns on the offensive side of the ball. Holy shit.\n\nOh, and Modello Especial has died. Cleveland vicariously pleasures itself.",

The county is an exclave as it is located more than 60 miles away from upstate new york and the state of Ohio and Pennsylvania are between it and New York\n\nFranklin was established as a New Yorker outpost in the ohio country in 1791, and grew in importance during the Ohio Country war when the Fort would be the center of New York's presence in the disputed region and the only part of it that the state held total control over.\n\nAfter Virginia rescinded the potomac resolutions, New York was left with a settlement in the country it had agreed to sell to the federal government, however many opposed it as the state has spent a considerable ammount fortifying the site and settling the swamps surrounding it, many also thought it would give new york an edge in controlling the economy of the future state of Ohio as well as put it in a better position in the border dispute with pennsylvania over the Lake Erie coast.\n\nNew York sent several hundred settlers over the next few years and New York organized it as a county in late 1798, this started a crisis as NY had previously agreed to give up its claim, New York initially claimed all the land between the Sandusky River and Pennsylvania's border, including the entire Saguin River Basin, this proposal was opposed by virginia and the congress, after much negotation both parties agreed to give New York a territory of less than 700 square miles, much less than the initially claimed 6,000 square miles, New York also had to give reparation to the federal government ammounting to six thousands pound, more than half of the price it sold the entire ohio county to the government.\n\nNew York quickly settled the exclave for fear of having it taken over, inviting thousands of families, but the state realized the potential of the city lay in the building of canal between Lake Erie and the Ohio River, In 1816, New York proposed Ohio to conjointly build a canal withotu national help, however the cost of the endeavour, the enmity between the two states over Franklin and the fear that the canal may overwhelmingly profit New York led to Ohio's refusal, Virginia and Pennsylvania, both lacking a port on Lake Erie (Waterford wouldn't be built for another 5 years) made a counter offer of a canal that would stay in Ohio, with its outlet in the Sandusky river, the state accepted and the Ohio and Erie Canal would be built between 1818 and 1823.\n\nThis would be a blow the city would never really recover from, as the city of Ogontz in Ohio siphoned most of the trade coming from the lakes, nevertheless its unique location brought some business opportunities, New York also invested significiantly in the city in hope of making it into an example of the State in the great lake region, the city benefited from Ogontz's boom, especially during and after the Civil war , the railway linking the latter city to Pittsburgh would cross Franklin, it would also become renowned as a touristic destination, the main one on the shores of lake erie, attracting summer tourists from not only Ohio and Pennsylvania but also Michigan, Ontario and the rest of New York. Like many places in the midwest it welcomed german migrants during the 19th century, although the county was quickly filled and the german influence is a bit less common than in most of Ohio.\n\n\nMany resident of Detroit or Ogontz have been moving to Franklin following the stagnation of the two industrial cities over the past couple decades, many new yorkers also come to Franklin Seasonally, which accented gentrification, especially along the shore east and west of the city center, immigration from the city of New York also made this city more ethnically diverse than the surrounding north ohio. It also tend to vote more to the left than most of conservative Upstate New York, although Social Labor has consistently lower results than in other places in Northern Ohio.\n\nMost Franklinite are proud to be New Yorkers, and several attempts, including two referendum in 1905 and 1983, to merge it with Ohio have met strong opposition, there exists a small party advocating for Statehood of Saguin County, but it has never gathered more than 7% of votes at local elections",

        "&gt;As more details emerge about Sunday's tornado in Shelby, the city continues to move forward with recovery.\n\n&gt;According to the National Weather Service's\u00a0official damage survey\u00a0released Monday, an F2 tornado (on the fujita tornado damage scale) was confirmed in Richland County. Maximum wind speeds were estimated at 120-125 miles per hour, and the tornado's maximum width was half a mile wide.\n\n&gt;The tornado traveled a 17-mile diagonal trek northeast across Richland County properties and townships, cutting across the south section of Shelby then moving northeast across several different townships.\n\n&gt;\"A long track tornado began about three miles southwest of Shelby around 4:42 p.m. then tracked northeast to about five miles north of Olivesburg,\" the report read. \"The most significant damage was located on the southeast and east side of Shelby from near the Chevy dealership along State Route 39 northeastward to State Route 96 where a home was significantly damaged.\"\n\n&gt;The Ohio Department of Transportation announced Monday afternoon that State Route 314 is now open. The road had been previously closed due to debris in the road from the tornado. Routes 39, 61 and 96 are all still closed at the time this story was published.\n\n&gt;Shelby safety services estimated approximately 30 structures were damaged across the city of Shelby and Sharon and Jackson Townships.\n\n&gt;Yet the community's spirit and resolve remained unscathed.\n\n&gt;\"This is what we do,\" said Shelby Police Chief Lance Combs. \"For whatever reason Shelby seems to be a natural disaster magnet, so we're kind of getting used to it.\"\n\n&gt;Shelby Mayor Steve Schag took a helicopter ride with the Ohio State Highway Patrol on Monday morning to follow the trail of debris left behind by the tornado.\n\n&gt;Outside of the Shelby businesses on the south side of town, he witnessed many homes and farms outside of Shelby's city limits flattened by the tornado, including evidence of the tornado skipping over certain properties.\n\n&gt;\"When you think of this event, please do not think just in terms of the city of Shelby, because our surrounding communities are hurting as well,\" Schag said. \"But our city has a history of picking ourselves up to move forward and recover, and that's what we plan on doing.\"\n\n&gt;The first priority in recovery falls on the main business stretch on State Route 39/Mansfield Avenue in Shelby, which bore the brunt of damage within city limits. Shelby's Director of Utilities John Ensman said an extensive amount of downed lines have prevented the reopening of State Route 39.\n\n&gt;\"Hopefully later this evening we have at least one lane open, with traffic signals established,\" Ensman said on Monday afternoon. \"And hopefully by tomorrow have all four lanes open on the Mansfield Avenue corridor.\"\n\n&gt;Ensman noted the city of Shelby lost approximately 60 percent of its power on Sunday. Within three hours 95 percent of power was restored, but power in the business district of Mansfield Avenue remains out. Ensman noted 15 other public power communities are assisting Shelby in the effort to restore power.\n\n&gt;Restoring the lost structures in Shelby and the surrounding townships will take longer. However, Richland County Auditor Pat Dropsey announced on Monday that if you are the owner of a home or business damaged by the recent tornado, you may be eligible to receive a reduction on your Tax Year 2019 real estate bill next calendar year.\n\n&gt;Dropsey confirmed state law authorizes County Auditors to reduce real estate values for properties that have been damaged or destroyed. A reduction in property value may result in lower real estate taxes for the property until it has been essentially restored to its prior condition or value.\n\n&gt;Personal property such as furniture and other personal belongings that have been destroyed are not included.\n\n&gt;\u201cWe would like to hear from citizens who have suffered structural damage to their property so that we may update our information and allow them to take advantage of statutory value relief,\" Dropsey said.\n\n&gt;The application deadline for Tax Year 2019 is Dec. 31, 2019. Applications for a property value reduction are available on the\u00a0[Richland County Auditor\u2019s website](https://www.richlandcountyauditor.org/pt/forms/htmlframe.aspx?mode=content/home.htm). Property owners can contact the Richland County Auditors office at 419-774-5501 for any additional information.\n\n&gt;The damages in Shelby have been mostly confined to structures and property, not human life. Christina Thompson, Media Relations and Communications Senior Consultant for OhioHealth Mansfield and Shelby Hospitals, said Shelby and Mansfield Hospitals received seven patients related to the storm. Five arrived in fair condition, one arrived in serious condition and one in critical condition.\n\n&gt;\"Zero fatalities is unbelievable,\" said Shelby Fire Chief Mike Thompson.\n\n&gt;\"Where that storm hit, and where it went through - time of day, place, all those things - half a mile north we have residential neighborhoods including retirement communities that would have been devastated,\" added Combs. \"If there's a silver lining, that's it.\"\n\n&gt;Lara L. Kiefer, executive director of the American Red Cross Lake Erie/Heartland Chapter, said a disaster team of volunteers set up a shelter at Shelby High School on Sunday night, and have moved to a standby shelter for now. The Red Cross also worked with the Shelby YMCA to allow families access to bathrooms and showers, and is providing comfort kits to those individuals.\n\n&gt;\"In addition, our team is starting to provide disaster assistance to each family and we have deployed an ERV (Emergency Response Vehicle) to the area to help feed those in need and the first responders,\" Kiefer said. \"Please keep our volunteers and the community members in your prayers.\"",

        "&gt; Here I mett Capt. John Richards of Boston who was going home, So being very glad of his Company we Rode something harder than hitherto, and missing my way in going up a very steep Hill, my horse dropt down under me as Dead; this new surprize no little hurt me meeting it Just at the Entrance into Dedham from whence we intended to reach home that night. But was now obliged to gett another Hors there and leave my own, resolving for Boston that night if possible.\n\nAs Massachusetts teacher Sarah Kemble Knight presents it in her 1705 diary, the exhaustion of her never-named horse was something more than a mere inconvenience, but less than a tragedy. The surprise still \"no little hurt me\" despite her being in just about the best possible place to have to swap out horses. But she--and whichever Dedham stable owner she encountered--saw no drama in swapping out horses.\n\nSome people absolutely did develop stronger bonds with their horse. Right around the time of Knight's journey, a horse owner from Appomac in Virginia named their mare \"Noby.\" Contemporary journals from the same area indicate that naming an animal was a sign of affection, not just utility--f.ex. cases where only one cow is noted as having a name, and is described with extra tenderness.\n\nBut in general, Knight's matter-of-factness about the horses that enabled her Boston-New York trip reflects the evolution of advice prescribed in horse-training and related manuals. Karen Raber and Treva Tucker sum up the general arc in their introduction to *The Culture of the Horse: Status, Discipline, and Identity in the Early Modern World.*\n\nIn the 16th and early 17th century, different types of texts recommend force, even abuse, for training horses--the idea being very much a rational man versus irrational nature combat. \"Bit-Books\" are just that: descriptions and illustrations of bits, concentrating on how the human can gain forceful control over the horse. Pia Cunco describes the early modern attitude towards bits:\n\n&gt; The longer the\nshank, the greater the leverage when the rein is activated, and the\ngreater the pressure that is exerted on the horse\u2019s sensitive oral\ntissues. The greater the pressure, the greater the pain, and that was\nwhat solved the practical problem of regulating a horse\u2019s pace.\n\n&gt; As the brief texts of the bit-books make clear, different bits were\nimplemented according to different training and behavioral\nproblems. \n\nBut Traber traces a gradual evolution moving further into the seventeenth century. Richard, earl of Newcastle, wrote in 1658:\n\n&gt;Great pains then must be taken to make a horse fear his rider, that so he may\nobey out of self-love, that he may avoid punishment. A horse\u2019s love is\nnot so safe to be trusted to, because it depends on his own will;\nwhereas his fear depends on the will of the rider, and that is being a\ndressed horse. But when the rider depends on the will of the horse, it\nis the horse that manages the rider. Love then is of no use; fear does\nall.\n\nObviously this sounds rather horrific, but there is something to be said about Newcastle's emphasis on *fear*. He's thinking about the horse's spirit, temperment, and (as is evident elsewhere in the treatise) thoughts:\n\n&gt; [The horse] is wise and subtile: for which reason man ought carefully to preserve his empire over him, knowing how nearly that wisdom and subtilty\napproaches his own.\n\nThe methods of training are still abusive, but there's more of a sense of a possible relationship--even if it's one of pure domination.\n\nIt's in the 18th century--the decades after Knight rode and wrote--that Traber sees training manuals advocating a more cooperative relationship. But there is still, she notes, absolutely no sense anywhere of a pet-type relationship.\n\nThis prescriptive advice is borne out in later diaries. Caroline Barnes Crosby's fascinating diary/memoirs of New York to Utah, and Utah to California, from the mid-19th century moves a step beyond Knight in terms of her willingness to portray affection for horses. But there is still a profoundly utilitarian sense. In the middle of a rough New York winter, she writes:\n\n&gt; We waited one day for\nthe snow to settle a little, and then set forth towards Lake Erie, found the\nsnow very deep, in some places. Mr Crosby walked nearly all the way; our\npretty black horse began to get thin, and look sober. \n\nCrosby's horse doesn't have a name, but she mentions it affectionately. And her description of its struggles goes a smidge beyond Knight's \"and it almost died.\" It's not a fluke. In 1836, she wrote:\n\n&gt; We found the roads almost impassable, the mud was up to\nthe horses knees. We had a hard time, was nearly a week going 100 miles. Our horse's breast became very sore. It gave me very unpleasant feelings\nto see him work in such misery.\n\nShe portrays herself empathizing with the horse!\n\nBut at the same time, horses were still a utilitarian possession. In 1848, her family encountered a group of Sioux riders \"dressed in very spendid indian style\" (...you think?). She writes that they traded a little bit and \"swaped horses\" [sic]. No detail, no description, no drama.\n\nThere still isn't a sense of \"horses as pets.\" And in fact, even in 1976, anthropologist Marshall Sahlins could remark that while the human-dog relationship resembled one of *family*, horses were traditionally treated more as servants or \"nonkin\" (friends?) even when they had personal names and \" we are in the habit of conversing with them as we do not talk to pigs and cattle.\" But even before horses ceased to be a primary mode of transportation, we can trace a long evolution *towards* a relationship closer to pets or friends than servants or beasts.",

        "This week's random postal code: [Chatham-Kent, Ontario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham-Kent)!\n\nLocated near the southern tip of Ontario between Lake Erie &amp; Lake Sinclar, Chatham-Kent is about 80km east of Windsor and the US border, and about 90km southwest of London. About 102,000 people live in the municipality which includes Chatham, Wallaceburg, Tilbury, Blenheim, Ridgetown, Wheatley, and Dresden. Chatham is the largest component of the municipality with an urban population of \\~43,500.\n\nPrior to European contact the lands that make up modern Chatham-Kent were occupied by a diverse array of indigenous peoples. The Chippewa/Ojibwe, Odawa/Ottawa, and Potawatomi co-habitated in the area and are generally considered to be interrelated to some degree under the umbrella of the Anishinaabe. The broader Anishinaabe group occupied all of southern Ontario and Quebec as well as Michigan.\n\nThe Anishinaabe first became allies of the French through the fur trade, a relationship through which a substantial number of M\u00e9tis would arise. Though generally peaceful with both its neighbours and colonists (albeit with a history of conflict with the Cree farther west around Lake Winnipeg) the Anishinaabe fought on the side of the French during the Seven Years' War, although the Anishinaabe were completely unfamiliar with the European style of warfare with its aims of resource acquisition and inflicting mass casualties.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Seven Years' War the Anishinaabe gradually came to friendly terms with the victorious British. However they also established the Three Fires Confederation as conflicts with encroaching settlers arose. Relations between the British and indigenous were sometimes tense, and in fact there were plans drawn up at Fort Pitt in 1763 between Colonels Boquet and Amherest to distribute smallpox-infected blankets to the Anishinaabe to eliminate as many indigenous people as possible - a plan that was never carried out, unlike such distributions in Mackinac nearby in Michigan in 1770.\n\nThe Anishinaabe fought alongside the British against the American revolutionaries, a decision that would see many flee north after the British defeat and subsequent American removal policies. Many Delaware people would also flee to the region and resettle in the territory. The Anishinaabe and Delware were made signatories of the McKee Treaty in 1790, trading a large portion of southwestern Ontario (including Chatham-Kent) in exchange for treaty payments - although there is evidence the First Nations leaders were made to sign an agreement in a language they did not understand. \n\nChatham was founded shortly thereafter in 1794, one of the first such communities in western Ontario. The original plan was for it to be a military settlement to monitor both the Americans and displaced First Nations (as well as a naval dockyard on the Thames river), however the military aspect was never truly developed and the rate of settlement was slow. Kent country lumbering supplied the Chatham economy, and gradually massive swaths of forest were cleared for agricultural use. \n\nThe War of 1812 was fought on Chatham's doorstep with the Battle of the Thames famously occurring nearby in Moraviantown, a First Nations community. Legendary leader Tecumseh was killed as he fought alongside the British against a much-larger American force, an American victory that would see them re-take the Detroit region. The region would be relatively quiet for the remainder of the war save for a battle with a raiding party in 1814. Tecumseh's death would spell the end of his nascent attempt at an indigenous Confederacy that unified many disparate indigenous groups.\n\nThe 1850's would give rise to another movement, with Chatham emerging as the northern center of anti-slavery activity connected to such movements in the United States. Chatham became a northern terminus for the Underground Railroad, marked now by the Buxton National Historic Site 19km south. Thousands of current residents can trace their direct lineage to escaped slaves brought north from the Railroad - though a substantial number of escaped slaves and their descendants returned to the United States after the end of slavery.\n\nThe early 20th century saw Chatham emerge as an auto manufacturing hub, first with the Chatham Motor Car Company and then the Denby Motor Truck Company of Canada. A fire engine manufacturer also sprung up, as well as a meat packing plant. During the Second World War Chatham-Kent farms, short on labour due to the number of men brought into the war effort, received interred persons of Japanese descent made to work as forced involuntary labour as part of the government's efforts to both supplant farm labour and relocated Canadians of Japanese descent away from British Columbia.\n\nChatham was amalgamated with the surrounding Kent region in 1998 and many services consolidated. The new municipality integrated police and fire departments and started a regional bus service in 2007.",

        "I'd definitely be interested in seeing a list on the threatened status of each species. Even e.g. the Caspian Sea region's species have many critically endangered species, yes. I knew the problem wasn't just limited to the US/North America.\n\nAs I noted in another comment, wikipedia notes that there are 27 species known in modern times, of which 4 are possibly extinct. [This article](https://www.iucn.org/content/sturgeon-more-critically-endangered-any-other-group-species) also paints a fairly grim picture of their situation, but annoyingly that study has also only assessed 18 of the presumably 23 species which are thought to still be around. Are the other 5 known to be just fine? Why isn't that mentioned? I'm not getting a full picture/good overview. Let's see if I can compile one myself...\n\nSubfamily Scaphirhynchinae:\n\n* pallid sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus albus), Missouri &amp; Missisippi rivers, ENDANGERED\n* shovelnose sturgeon, Scaphirhynchus platorynchus, Missouri &amp; Mississippi rivers, VULNERABLE, still commercially fished\n* Alabama sturgeon, Scaphirhynchus suttkusi, only extant in ~130 miles of the lower Alabama river, CRITICALLY ENDANGERED\n* Syr Darya sturgeon (Pseudoscaphirhynchus fedtschenkoi), Syr Darya river/previously the Aral Sea, CRITICALLY ENDANGERED AND LIKELY EXTINCT, no sightings since 1960\n* dwarf sturgeon, little shovelnose sturgeon, or small Amu-dar shovelnose sturgeon (Pseudoscaphirhynchus hermanni); Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, CRITICALLY ENDANGERED, but knowledge is sparse\n* Amu Darya sturgeon or false shovelnose sturgeon (Pseudoscaphirhynchus kaufmanni), same countries as the previous, CRITICALLY ENDANGERED\n\nSubfamily Acipenserinae:\n\n* kaluga (Huso dauricus), Amur river basin (Russian Far East/Northeast China), CRITICALLY ENDANGERED\n* beluga or European sturgeon (Huso huso), Caspian and Black Seas, sometimes the Adriatic, CRITICALLY ENDANGERED\n* Siberian sturgeon (Acipenser baerii), all major Siberian river basins, ENDANGERED\n* Baikal sturgeon, Acipenser baerii baicalensis, subspecies of the previous, found in the Lake Baikal and the Selenga river, ENDANGERED\n* shortnose sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum), eastern North America from Florida to New Brunswick, VULNERABLE\n* Dabry's sturgeon (Acipenser dabryanus), Yangtze River Basin, CRITICALLY ENDANGERED, would likely be extinct if not for captive breeding (doesn't seem to be breeding in the wild)\n* lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens), North America, LEAST CONCERN as a species, but rare in many places, e.g. the Lake Erie fishery has collapsed, and 19 out of 20 US states in its original range list it as threatened or endangered\n* Russian sturgeon (Acipenser gueldenstaedtii), several countries, including Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, Russia, Kazakstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Iran, and the Caucasus countries and Caspian Sea in the middle of those, CRITICALLY ENDANGERED\n* green sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris), Pacific Ocean/China, Russia, Canada, US, NEAR THREATENED\n* Sakhalin sturgeon (Acipenser mikadoi), Japan and Russia, CRITICALLY ENDANGERED\n* Adriatic sturgeon (Acipenser naccarii), Adriatic sea and neighbouring countries' large rivers, CRITICALLY ENDANGERED, possibly extinct/not spawning in the wild, but being bred in captivity.\n* bastard sturgeon, fringebarbel sturgeon, ship sturgeon, spiny sturgeon, or thorn sturgeon (Acipenser nudiventris), formerly Black, Aral and Caspian seas, now maybe only the Ural river and possibly a couple of others, healthiest population is an introduced one in a lake in Kazakhstan, supposedly reproduces the best out of all sturgeons, CRITICALLY ENDANGERED\n* Gulf sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus desotoi), 1/2 subspecies, Gulf of Mexico, VULNERABLE\n* Atlantic sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus oxyrinchus), 2/2 subspecies, eastern North America from Florida to New Brunswick, [historically had also colonised the Baltic sea region](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2527320/) but now extinct there, NEAR THREATENED (same for the species as a whole)\n* Persian sturgeon (Acipenser persicus), Caspian and Black seas, certain rivers, CRITICALLY ENDANGERED\n* sterlet (Acipenser ruthenus), Black, Azov and Caspian sea, rivers in Siberia, VULNERABLE\n* Japanese sturgeon, or Amur sturgeon (Acipenser schrenckii), Amur River basin, China and Russia, CRITICALLY ENDANGERED\n* Chinese sturgeon (Acipenser sinensis), formerly China, Japan, and Korean peninsula, CRITICALLY ENDANGERED, many populations are extinct\n* starry sturgeon (Acipenser stellatus), Black, Azov, Caspian and Aegean seas, extinct in the Aegaen and much of it's former river range, CRITICALLY ENDANGERED\n* European sea sturgeon (Acipenser sturio), most coasts of Europe, CRITICALLY ENDANGERED\n* White sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), Eastern Pacific from the Gulf of Alaska to possibly northern Baja California, LEAST CONCERN, despite being near exctinction in the early 1900s. Is one of a few species that are farmed.\n\nDoing a save to count each status, although I definitely agree that your general assessment seems to have been correct...\n\nThe count is:\n\n* Critically endangered 16, including 1-3 possibly extinct/extinct in the wild\n* Endangered 3\n* Vulnerable 4\n* Near threatened 2\n* Least concern 2\n\nJust for the sake of nitpicking, YMMV if 70% (19/27) is a vast majority, but it's not unambiguously *not* a vast majority either, so I'm going to say yes in this case.\n\nBut in any case, hopefully someone else found the previous list enlightening/helpful.",

        "Here ya go....\nDismayed by the lack of marksmanship shown by their troops, Union veterans Col. William C. Church and Gen. George Wingate formed the National Rifle Association in 1871. The primary goal of the association would be to \"promote and encourage rifle shooting on a scientific basis,\" according to a magazine editorial written by Church.\n\nAfter being granted a charter by the state of New York on November 17, 1871, the NRA was founded. Civil War Gen. Ambrose Burnside, who was also the former governor of Rhode Island and a U.S. senator, became the fledgling NRA's first president.\n\nAn important facet of the NRA's creation was the development of a practice ground. In 1872, with financial help from New York State, a site on Long Island, the Creed Farm, was purchased for the purpose of building a rifle range. Named Creedmoor, the range opened a year later, and it was there that the first annual matches were held.\n\nPolitical opposition to the promotion of marksmanship in New York forced the NRA to find a new home for its range. In 1892, Creedmoor was deeded back to the state and NRA's matches moved to Sea Girt, New Jersey.\n\nThe NRA's interest in promoting the shooting sports among America's youth began in 1903 when NRA Secretary Albert S. Jones urged the establishment of rifle clubs at all major colleges, universities and military academies. By 1906, NRA's youth program was in full swing with more than 200 boys competing in matches at Sea Girt that summer. Today, youth programs are still a cornerstone of the NRA, with more than one million youth participating in NRA shooting sports events and affiliated programs with groups such as 4-H, the Boy Scouts of America, the American Legion, Royal Rangers, National High School Rodeo Association and others.\n\nDue to the overwhelming growth of NRA's shooting programs, a new range was needed. Gen. Ammon B. Crichfield, adjutant general of Ohio, had begun construction of a new shooting facility on the shores of Lake Erie, 45 miles east of Toledo, Ohio. Camp Perry became the home of the annual National Matches, which have been the benchmark for excellence in marksmanship ever since. With nearly 6,000 people competing annually in pistol, smallbore and high-power events, the National Matches are one of the biggest sporting events held in the country today.\n\nThrough the association's magazine, The American Rifleman, members were kept abreast of new firearms bills, although the lag time in publishing often prevented the necessary information from going out quickly. In response to repeated attacks on the Second Amendment rights, NRA formed the Legislative Affairs Division in 1934. While NRA did not lobby directly at this time, it did mail out legislative facts and analyses to members, whereby they could take action on their own. In 1975, recognizing the critical need for political defense of the Second Amendment, NRA formed the Institute for Legislative Action, or ILA.\n\nMeanwhile, the NRA continued its commitment to training, education and marksmanship. During World War II, the association offered its ranges to the government, developed training materials, encouraged members to serve as plant and home guard members, and developed training materials for industrial security. NRA members even reloaded ammunition for those guarding war plants. Incidentally, the NRA's call to help arm Britain in 1940 resulted in the collection of more than 7,000 firearms for Britain's defense against potential invasion by Germany (Britain had virtually disarmed itself with a series of gun-control laws enacted between World War I and World War II).\n\nAfter the war, the NRA concentrated its efforts on another much-needed arena for education and training: the hunting community. In 1949, the NRA, in conjunction with the state of New York, established the first hunter education program. Hunter Education courses are now taught by state fish and game departments across the country and Canada and have helped make hunting one of the safest sports in existence. Due to increasing interest in hunting, NRA launched a new magazine in 1973, The American Hunter, dedicated solely to hunting issues year-round. NRA continues its leadership role in hunting today with the Youth Hunter Education Challenge (YHEC), a program that allows youngsters to build on the skills they learned in basic hunter education courses. YHECs are now held in 43 states and three Canadian provinces, involving an estimated 40,000 young hunters.\n\nThe American Hunter and The American Rifleman were the mainstays of NRA publications until the debut of The American Guardian in 1997. The Guardian was created to cater to a more mainstream audience, with less emphasis on the technicalities of firearms and a more general focus on self-defense and recreational use of firearms. The Guardian was renamed America's 1st Freedom in June of 2000.\n\nLaw enforcement training was next on the priority list for program development. Although a special police school had been reinstated at Camp Perry in 1956, NRA became the only national trainer of law enforcement officers with the introduction of its NRA Police Firearms Instructor certification program in 1960. Today, there are more than 13,000 NRA-certified police and security firearms instructors. Additionally, top law enforcement shooters compete each year in eight different pistol and shotgun matches at the National Police Shooting Championships held in Albuquerque, New Mexico.\n\nIn civilian training, the NRA continues to be the leader in firearms education. Over 125,000 certified instructors now train about 1,000,000 gun owners a year. Courses are available in basic rifle, pistol, shotgun, muzzleloading firearms, personal protection, even ammunition reloading. Additionally, nearly 7,000 certified coaches are specially trained to work with young competitive shooters. Since the establishment of the lifesaving Eddie Eagle GunSafe\u00ae Program in 1988, more than 28 million pre-kindergarten to fourth grade children have learned that if they see a firearm in an unsupervised situation, they should \"STOP. DON'T TOUCH. RUN AWAY. TELL A GROWNUP.\" Over the past seven years, Refuse To Be A Victim\u00ae seminars have helped more than 100,000 men and women develop their own personal safety plan using common sense strategies.\n\nIn 1990, NRA made a dramatic move to ensure that the financial support for firearms-related activities would be available now and for future generations. Establishing the NRA Foundation, a 501 (c) (3) tax-exempt organization, provided a means to raise millions of dollars to fund gun safety and educational projects of benefit to the general public. Contributions to the Foundation are tax-deductible and benefit a variety of American constituencies including youth, women, hunters, competitive shooters, gun collectors, law enforcement agents and persons with physical disabilities.\n\nWhile widely recognized today as a major political force and as America's foremost defender of Second Amendment rights, the NRA has, since its inception, been the premier firearms education organization in the world. But our successes would not be possible without the tireless efforts and countless hours of service our nearly five million members have given to champion Second Amendment rights and support NRA programs. As former Clinton spokesman George Stephanopoulos said, \"Let me make one small vote for the NRA. They're good citizens. They call their congressmen. They write. They vote. They contribute. And they get what they want over time.\"",

        "I've been working on using mainly native species in my plantings if I can. It's better for the local ecosystem and it's a marketing point. There are some exceptions, of course, but it's fairly easy to do. I do count cultivars as native if they are derived from the pure native species (e.g. Echinacea purpurea 'Ruby Star'). I also like to use different colours of foliage to add contrast. \n\nI don't use too many plants for spring since bulbs and Phlox do the job nicely. Summer is when you get the most bang for your buck. Lots here!\n\n__Bulbs: __\n\nMainly Narcissus, Hyacinthus, and Allium giganteum. Tulips are nice, but the squirrels like them too much.\n\n__Perennials: __\n\nPhlox subulata is an excellent fast-growing semi-evergreen groundcover. It flowers for over a month in early spring, is extremely drought-tolerant and will take part shade, with less vigour. \n\nPenstemon digitalis (Beardtongue) is my current favourite native perennial. 'Dark Towers' has strong stems with lots of pink tubular flowers that bees love _and_ dark red foliage. Very drought tolerant and great for clay. Flowers early summer.\n\nIris is a typical go-to perennial for most people. Lots of colour, drought tolerant. Flowers early summer. \n\nEchinacea purpurea (Coneflower) is one of my favourite mid-late summer flowering perennials. Native and drought-tolerant with very deep roots. Reblooms if dead-headed regularly. There are many different colours, but beware that many of these are hybridized with Mexican varieties and Their Bloodline Is Weak And They Will Not Survive The Winter. Some are essentially annuals; look for the full species name. \n\nRudbeckia fulgida (Black-eyed Susan) is very common and very hard to kill. Also spreads like crazy through expansion and seed. 'Goldsturm' is 99% of what you'll see and use. Drought-tolerant but wilts easily, making it look like it's having trouble. Yellow flowers mid summer to early fall. Decent winter interest if light snow and not exposed to wind.\n\nGeranium 'Rozanne' is an excellent edging perennial. Generously reblooming purple flowers from early summer until frost. If it gets gangly just cut it back to the base and it will regrow with renewed vigour.\n\nLeucanthemum (Shasta Daisy) is another good edging perennial. White flowers mid summer and good green foliage. Tends to spread.\n\nHeuchera (Coral Bells) are good for edging and mass plantings for any sun and any soil. Every colour foliage in many patterns and shape except blue. Flowers in a bit of a lull between spring and early summer, then periodically through the summer if dead-headed. Mainly used for foliage colour.\n\nHemerocallis (Daylily) is a very common perennial that is used by landscapers and towns everywhere because you quite literally can not kill these things. I've tried. Flowering time varies from early to late summer depending on cultivar. Will often rebloom if you cut the entire thing down to the base. I tend to try and avoid these just because of how common they are.\n\nHostas are your typical shade perennial in hundreds of patterns and shapes of green, white, blue, and lime. Flowering time varies between cultivars. These are also pretty much invincible to anything you throw at them. I also try to avoid these due to how common they are but sometimes are necessary.\n\nSedum (Stonecrop) is yet another invincible perennial for edging and mass planting. Exists as both groundcover and flowering perennial, of which I use the latter. Foliage in both green and purple, flowers usually pink in late summer to early fall. Excellent for winter interest as they tend to mostly hold until spring.\n\nAster flowers late summer to mid fall depending on cultivar. These spread through underground rhizomes. Aggressively. \n\nAsclepias tuberosa (Butterflyweed) is a native milkweed that Monarch butterflies lay eggs on &amp; consume. I've seen them on these before. Very drought tolerant, likes clay, and orange flowers mid-summer. Tends to come up later than most perennials. May rebloom if you dead-head.\n\nEupatorium rugosum (Chocolate boneset) is a less known perennial. White flowers in early fall and has chocolate brown to dark purple foliage most of the season. \n\nBaptisia australis (Blue False Indigo) is, despite the name, a native drought tolerant perennial. Many different colour of flower in mid summer. Seed pods rattle in the wind if you let them mature. These get big.\n\nHepatica (Liverleaf) is a native ephemeral that grows in forests. The very first thing to flower in the spring and somewhat rare. Needs part to full shade. If you can find some for purchase (DO NOT DIG THESE UP!!!!) they will greatly add to a shady garden. Blue, white, or pink flowers depending on species.\n\n__Shrubs:__ Most flowering deciduous shrubs can be cut back to the ground for rejuvenation.\n\nPrunus pumila (Purple Sandcherry) provides excellent red/purple foliage and gorgeous white flowers in early summer. I've been using these less as they are susceptible to many fruit tree problems.\n\nSambucus nigra (Black Lace Elderberry) has graceful dark purple foliage all season long and slightly scented whitish pink flowers in early-mid summer. These can get big if you let them. Another favourite. \n\nPhysocarpus (Ninebark) is an extremely drought tolerant native shrub. Seriously, these things thrive in bedrock along the shore of Lake Erie. Several different colours of foliage, flowers briefly in early-mid summer. Good in mass plantings for foliage colour.\n\nIlex meserveae (Winterberry) is a native deciduous holly that grows around bogs and in the woods. Drought tolerant, likes clay and wet soil. Gets covered in berries for the winter once established. Just started using this so no real impressions yet.\n\nThuja occidentalis (White Cedar) is your typical cedar. Many different sizes and shapes, can be cut back to stubs and regrow. Useful when needing an evergreen foundation since it smells better than Taxus.\n\nArctostaphylos uva-ursi (Bearberry) is a native evergreen groundcover shrub. Tiny pink flowers in spring and red berries in fall into the winter. From what I've seen despises clay. Very drought and salt-tolerant.\n\nCornus (Dogwood) is a useful shrub for winter interest. Mostly the ones with red stems in the winter. There are a few native species which I currently forget, but several colours of foliage as well. Flowers early summer but more or less irrelevant. \n\nAmelanchier canadensis is another tough as nails native shrub/small tree. White flowers in early summer and excellent fall colour. You often see these in parking lots due to their resistance to, well, everything.\n\nRhododendron is a very graceful flowering evergreen shrub for upscale homes. Somewhat needy, requiring acidic soil, regular moisture, and part shade unless heavily irrigated. Flowering times vary from mid spring to mid summer depending on cultivar. Dead-head once flowering is finished for better blooms the following year.\n\nAcer palmatum (Japanese Maple) are good shrubs for focal points and contrast. Many colours, sizes, and lead shapes. Drought tolerant once established and don't care about soil type. Need a sheltered location or they _will_ get leaf scorch and winter dieback.\n\nTsuga canadensis (Canadian Hemlock) is typically a tree, but I've found some excellent dwarf and weeping cultivars. These are fairly drought tolerant once established and have graceful, airy emerald green foliage.\n\n__Grasses__: All of these are drought tolerant and tolerate any soil type. I particularly like the native grasses. These are good for winter interest, cornerstones, adding height, and contrast.\n\nPanicum virgatum (Switchgrass) is a native prairie grass. Flowers mid to late summer and offers a very airy look. Best viewed against the sun where it lights up the florets. Several foliage colours. \n\nSchizachyrium scoparium (Little Bluestem) is another native prairie grass. Shorter than the rest of the list, also comes in more colours ranging from blue to almost-black.

        "It has come full circle for Pat Vuyancih and the NCAA Tournament\u2019s Sweet 16.\n\nVuyancih was a player on the Kevin Mackey-coached Cleveland State University team that in March 1986 secured the program\u2019s first bid to the NCAA Division I men\u2019s basketball tournament.\n\nThe \u201crun and stun\u201d Vikings opened with an upset victory over the heavily favored Indiana Hoosiers in the first round. They followed with a victory over St. Joseph in the second round before dropping a 71-70 heartbreaker to Navy and future NBA star David Robinson in the round of 16.\n\nNow, the 54-year-old Euclid resident will make the drive to Rock Island, Ill., on March 9 to watch son Tony Vuyanich play for John Carroll University against host Augustana (24-5) in the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Division III tournament.\n\n Advertisement\n\n\nADVERTISING\n\nThe younger Vuyancih starts at shooting guard and averages 13.9 points for the Blue Streaks (25-5), who got this far by winning NCAA tournament games against Thomas More and Wooster at home after capturing the Ohio Athletic Conference regular season and tournament titles.\n\nBased on what he regards as life-shaping experiences of playing at CSU during the 1985-86 and 1986-87 seasons, Pat Vuyancih has advised his son to savor every moment of JCU\u2019s journey in the NCAA tournament.\n\n\u201cThe most special thing about our Sweet 16 run is that the guys from that team are still very close as former teammates and friends,\u201d Vuyancih said. \u201cWhen you get to that level, there\u2019s a bond formed that doesn\u2019t break. No matter what happens in life, you\u2019re always going to have those guys behind you. And you\u2019ll be behind them. These are relationships for life.\u201d.\n\nTony Vuyancih said he already feels that way about his JCU teammates. He\u2019s especially close to fellow seniors Matt Csuhran, Brian Papich and Notre Dame Cathedral Latin product John Cirillo.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something about playing college basketball and having your best friends on the court with you or on the bench next to you that is unreal.\u201d he said.\n\nBoth laughed when asked if in recent days there had been any good-natured dialogue about the son\u2019s team now matching the father\u2019s team in getting to the round of 16.\n\n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t talked any trash, but I am trying to beat his team\u2019s Sweet 16 and help my team get to the Elite 8,\u201d Tony Vuyancih said, smiling.\n\n\u201cIf you guys win (on March 9), I\u2019ll be happy to concede that point,\u201d Pat Vuyancih added.\n\nSince August 2017, Pat Vuyancih has worked at CSU as clinical internship program coordinator. Prior to returning to is alma mater, he was a teacher, coach and administrator in various public school systems and at Lake Erie College.\n\nPat Vuyancih\u2019s playing career in basketball had its share of ups and downs. He was cut from the basketball team at St. Joseph High School (now Villa Angela St. Joseph) as a sophomore, transferred to Euclid and didn\u2019t make the team there as a junior. It wasn\u2019t until his senior year at Euclid, under the guidance of legendary coach Harold \u201cDoc\u201d Daugherty, that he found his stride while averaging 14 points and nine rebounds.\n\n\u201cI was a late bloomer,\u201d he said, laughing.\n\nHe spent one year at Allegheny (Pa.) College, came home to attend Lakeland Community College and then enrolled at CSU. He walked onto that talented CSU team during the 1985-86 season and played sparingly while earning respect from Mackey and his teammates.\n\nThe next season, Vuyancih earned a scholarship and a spot in Mackey\u2019s rotation. He averaged 6.8 points and 4.3 rebounds, starting 14 of 32 games, on a team that finished 25-8 and played into the second round of the National Invitation Tournament,\n\n\u201cGrowing up, from a lot people I didn\u2019t even know, I heard all about what a tough player my dad was and he fought his way onto those teams at Euclid and Cleveland State,\u201d Tony Vuyancih said.\n\nThe younger Vuyancih played on a high school Division I state championship team at St. Edward before attending John Carroll. He said his father\u2019s experiences as a player inform his approach to the game.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d never let me walk around like I was top dog on the court,\u201d Tony Vuyancih said.\n\nIn addition to Tony, Pat Vuyancih and his wife, Aurea, have two daughters, Tiana and Celina, and another son, Joe. All of the Vuyancih kids gravitated to basketball and excelled at the high-school level. Tiana also was an outstanding volleyball player at VASJ. Joe played at Lake Catholic and for one season at JCU. Celina played at Euclid and just finished her freshman season at JCU.\n\nPat Vuyancih admits to being an avid and mostly good basketball dad to all of his children.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve gotten better at it as I\u2019ve gone along,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the stands, I try to sit in places where I won\u2019t be seen or heard. I really tried hard not to talk to them right after games. Most of the time, I was successful. But there were times where I would get a little bit upset. Usually it was about the effort things. I never got on them about missing a shot. \u201c\n\nTony Vuyancih smiled as he listened to his father talk about the high-wire act of being an engaged basketball dad.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re younger, it\u2019s hard to take those car rides home after a bad game,\u201d Tony Vuyancih said. \u201cI got it pretty good sometimes. As you get older and reflect on it, you realize it made you stronger. It made you a better basketball player.\u201d\n\nOn the trip to Illinois, Pat Vuyancih will be accompanied by Aurea and their daughters.\n\n\u201cOf course, we\u2019re going,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a basketball family.\u201d",

To be as accurate as possible, I made sure that the route fulfilled the following requirements:\n\n1. Monument Valley-Canon City goes through the Rocky Mountains and has a kind of deviation to a town that is around 400km from Monument Valley.\n2. Canon City-Kansas City passes through the 4 cities mentioned: Syracuse, Dodge City, Kinsley and Hutchinston.\n3. Kansas City-Chicago crosses the Mississippi river through Fort Madison.\n4. Chicago-Mackinaw City goes on the west coast of Lake Michigan and passes through Milwaukee.\n5. Mackinaw City-Philadelphia goes on the south west of Lake Erie, passes at the side of Gettysburg and ends at the Benjamin Franklin Parkway.\n6. Philadelphia-Union Beach passes through the final area of the battle against Valentine.\n7. The race ends at Trinity.\n\nNow, the main problem I found is that there's a limit on the ammount of locations and route modifications you can make, so I had to go kind of rough at some points.\n\nThe two main differences with the actual manga are:\n\n1. The absence of the stage 1 goal. To be honest this church is most likely fictional and can't be found in Google Maps\n\n2. The last stage is only faithful to the manga on the place of the goal. Unfortunately the only route Google let me choose for a Union Beach-Trinity travel was a ferry to the west of Manhattan, instead of the ferry to Coney Island and travel to Trinity through the Brooklyn bridge of the manga.\n\nBut oh well, I think they are small enough to still have a pretty decent resemblance to the manga's route.\n\nAs a side note and an anecdote, I took the chance and checked what was located at the corpse's spine's coordinates in present days. Turned out it was a church in the outskirts of the current Kansas City. The funny thing is that when I clicked on it, [this showed up.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/149987109212651520/423874500636180480/829fd62497cf0a0ceb21e41fc3c30f0a.png)\n\nAnyways, I hope you find this route that I spent a good part of the evening making as something interesting.",

        "It's been a very slow process. I'm going to try to detail some of the things that helped me, so this is going to be a long comment.\n\nI read a totally unrelated book by a psychologist (it was about healing from bad eating habits, but used cognitive behavioral therapy techniques) that recommended making index cards or sticky notes for every new lesson you want to learn while healing. So I wrote up an index card that said something like \"you are not responsible for your father's feelings\" and stuck it in my wallet for a while. I also took a picture of it and kept the image file on my phone. And I wrote it on a sticky note and stuck it near my computer monitor. \n\nThe psychologist who wrote the book recommended that whenever you feel overly emotional or you're struggling on your journey, pull out your index card and look at it. Read it out loud if you can. If you're stuck at work or something, pull up a picture of the card on your phone. It will feel totally unnatural at first. But reminding myself over and over that I'm not responsible for him has helped, and I don't need the reminder card in my wallet anymore- I just naturally tell myself what I need to hear. \n\nOn that note, Dr. Beck also universally recommends that people on healing journeys leave a few notes in their living space with a message along the lines of \"give yourself credit\" for when things get really bad or for when we beat ourselves up. I think I still have one tucked away in my living room.\n\nAnother important message that I told myself over and over was \"even if I wanted to help my father, I'm not qualified\". I think of a BPD parent like a drowning victim, only they're drowning in their feelings, rage and sadness instead of water. I worked as a lifeguard for years. Even a trained guard can't go in after a drowning victim without equipment like a rescue tube (the big red floaty thing that says \"GUARD\" on it). The drowning victim will pull them under and both will die. It's morbid, but it's just how it is, especially if you're talking about someone struggling near a beach or in other natural water. I used to live right near Lake Erie near some beautiful beaches, and it would occasionally pop up in the newspaper- \"2 local men drowned. One was trying to save the other and was pulled under.\" \n\nWhat our BPD parents do when they demand that we fix them, is absurd. Imagine a drowning victim who is tossed a [ring buoy](http://www.scoutorama.com/images/max610_no_overlay/ts-activity-ring-buoy-throw.jpg) then shouts \"NO NO! I WANT *MY CHILD* TO SAVE ME!\" Then when a lifeguard goes in after them, the person pops above water for a moment and screams that they don't want a lifeguard, they want their untrained, unequipped, *child* to save them. It's absolute madness. And they will pull you down with them if you let them. [Note for any RBBs reading this- it's equally mad for a romantic partner to insist on their problems being solved by their boyfriend/girlfriend/husband/wife. Please always remember that!]\n\nI think of therapy and mental health professionals as being like the lifeguards in this case. The lessons learned from therapy could be comparable to swim lessons. For my own health and safety, I can't go in after him. That thought helped me in the early days of my healing journey, because it *hurt*. It *hurts* to watch another human being struggle and not do anything to help them. We're hurt by it because of the empathy that we feel. But we can't sacrifice ourselves to let someone who refuses to help themselves drag us under. \n\nSo in addition to my mantra that I'm not responsible for my father's feelings, I remind myself of the opportunities he has had to get help or emotional support, that he has turned down. He had one therapy appointment at a local mental health clinic before he raged and stormed out because they implied that something might be \"wrong\" with him. (I.e. that he could benefit from therapy and that his health insurance would cover it!)\n\nHe has raged at multiple jobs and effectively gotten himself blacklisted in his region, despite being an incredibly talented engineer, because of his actions at work. But that was his own doing. He has pushed away possible friends and alienated all of his neighbors. But that was his own doing. He has pushed away people at his church. But that was his own doing. He has pushed members of his own family away and into low contact or very low contact status. But that was his own doing. And I'm guessing that my experience isn't unique. \n\nSo grab a few index cards and write \"I am not responsible for my mother's feelings. Even if I wanted to help, I am not qualified. She is an adult, and is capable of asking qualified people for help if she really wanted it. It's OK that this is difficult. Give yourself credit for how far you've come.\" Stick the cards in a few places and read it to yourself 3 times when you get stuck in that mental rut. I'm not a mental health professional, but that's some of what helped me personally. I bet some of the other folks in this sub have their own tips as well.",

        "I was actually in Gary yesterday, took an air taxi with my best friend to pick up his airplane in Wisconsin. We discussed some of the issues you mentioned, along with our 55 year old pilot who has been flying out of Gary sing 1985. Like I said before, the airport is like an oasis in the desert: if I didn\u2019t tell you where we were going and I blindfolded you so you couldn\u2019t see the area we were surrounded by while arriving, you\u2019d never guess we were in one of America\u2019s worst cities. Very few residents use the airport, so it\u2019s the tale of two opposite worlds.\n\nNow the train. The NICTD is electric light rail, going from downtown Chicago to South Bend, IN. It goes through Gary and turns into a streetcar in Michigan City. Goes through the roughest parts of both the South side of Chicago and Northwest Indiana. However, the train is safe. Yes, assorted crimes do happen but not like the CTA Elevated train that serves Chicago and some surrounding areas. The EL has some serious crime, but I believe that\u2019s because it\u2019s both cheap at $3 and runs continuously. It\u2019s feasiable to board at one place and spend the whole day riding without paying again. Ergo, it serves as a defacto hotel for homeless in some nights.\n\nI\u2019ve been lucky, haven\u2019t been the victim of any EL crimes. I\u2019ve witnessed a few mugging and smart phone grabs (very common. Thieves grab smart phones of sitting passengers while exiting out a door typically behind them so they can\u2019t give chase). The worst situation I\u2019ve been in was an a strange guy, maybe 50 or so, traveling with a much younger pregnant girl (maybe 16-20) where he offered the girl to have sex with me for $20 or blow me for $10, right there in the train at 1AM. I declined, he got pissed and aggressive for me to then just give him money. Out of the blue and complete luck, the next stop we picked up a K9 security officer that watches trains and the guy and girl got spooked and left. Never have particularly seen any violence. Wife and I saw a dead body at a stop a few years ago, but that was just some homeless drunk.\n\nAs for general crime in Chicago, the bulk of the worst of it is isolated to the south and west sides. Yes, crime happens everywhere in the city, but realistically, those aforementioned areas are the ones you\u2019d stay out of and would be fine. Crime happens anywhere, but knowing where it happens more is a good way to avoid it here. Gary has it more spread out: I don\u2019t know of anywhere, outside of airport property, that I\u2019d call safe in Gary. I certainly don\u2019t like being there after dark. \n\nChicago isn\u2019t a typical Midwest city in that it\u2019s larger, more spread out and didn\u2019t take the full on collapse of manufacturing as hard as say Cleveland or Detroit did. Detroit lived and died by auto manufacturing, where Chicago didn\u2019t have all its eggs in one basket. This has made recovery less difficult. In the 1980s, Chicago was a dirty city on the verge of falling into the typical Midwest pattern. Investment saved that and the city cleaned many things up. The homicide rate in the 90s was more than double today (not exact figures but approx 950 homicides in 1990 to about 425ish last year).\n\nMilwaukee is also undergoing some interesting changes, a cleanup similar to early 90s Chicago. Detroit allegeldy is too, but I haven\u2019t been to Detroit since 2003 and don\u2019t really plan on going anytime soon, so I can\u2019t verify that like I can in Milwaukee. Cleveland has its own issues (plus Lake Erie has always had the reputation amongst sportsman as being the dirtiest and worst Great Lake, but even that is changing). The change in mafacturing was hard on all these cities. All have elevated crime rates, rat infestation and pollution issues. All seem to be being addressed to various degrees of success.\n\nEast St Louis and Gary though always stand out as smaller cities that have big city crime rates. Both are in the shadows of bigger cities with crime problem and both seem to amplify that. Both live up to their reputations as being places you don\u2019t want to get caught after dark.\n\n",

Solo por la venta ilegal de estos estupefacientes, **las bandas mafiosas embolsan 1.080 millones de d\u00f3lares, unos 21.000 millones de pesos**, o el equivalente al presupuesto en salud que se destina en la provincia de Buenos Aires. Estas cifras, brutales por d\u00f3nde se las analice, sirven para comprender el porqu\u00e9 de la lucha que a sangre y fuego protagonizan las bandas mafiosas en los barrios m\u00e1s postergados para instalar bunkers y kioscos de venta de drogas minorista o al \"menudeo\".\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt;  Seg\u00fan los c\u00e1lculos realizados por Mart\u00edn Verrier, el Subsecretario de Lucha contra el Narcotr\u00e1fico, consultado por Infobae para esta investigaci\u00f3n, el consumidor de marihuana, gasta unos 7.200 pesos anuales en marihuana.

A medida que nosotros secuestramos una mayor cantidad de drogas, afectamos la oferta y el precio en la calle sube. Hay una realidad.

        "The post-Revolution Russian/Red armies may be the best example of armies with elected officers, but they also appeared a century earlier, halfway around the world, during the War of 1812.\n\nThe American ground forces in that war were split into two or three different groups (depending on how you categorize it): \n\n- The regular army, signed for long-term enlistments and with officers appointed through the chain of command\n- State militias called up to defend their homes, or attached to the national army to fight farther afield\n- Volunteers, who signed up for shorter terms and often elected their officers\n\nThe distinction was both technical and ideological. Jeffersonian Republicans often saw standing armies as a threat to liberty and preferred the idea of citizen soldiers rising patriotically to serve their country. One prominent New York Republican, Peter B. Porter, promised to raise a bridge \"to assert its equal rights and privileges with the regular troops, and not be what an inferior militia force always will be, the tools and drudges of the regular troops.\"\n\nHistorian Alan Taylor writes: \n\n&gt; Unlike regulars, the volunteers would serve for only six months and would elect their own officers except for the brigade commander, Porter, and his second-in-command, John Swift. The men would receive eight dollars per month, equipment, arms and rations, but they had to provide their own clothing.\n\nThe volunteer troops under their elected officers were notoriously undisciplined and prone to looting when they crossed into Canada \u2014 particularly devastating given that American war plans hoped to recruit Canadian settlers onto their side. Historian Donald R. Hickey writes that \"one army officer claimed that those (volunteers) he inspected were little better than organized bandits who wasted public property, insulted private citizens and freely engaged in 'desertion, robbery, [and] disorderly and mutinous conduct.\" \n\nTaylor notes that \"a bifurcated army \u2014 half regulars and half volunteers and Indians,\" had \"clashing standards of discipline.\" Regular army generals issued orders against looting. But volunteers, \"resenting the destruction of the Niagara frontier towns in December... regarded plunder as a just revenge against the Canadian 'Tories.' The burning zeal of the volunteers worked at cross-purposes with (Major General Jacob) Brown's pursuit of honor by a professional army.\"\n\nThat said, it's not like the regular American army was a paragon of discipline, Taylor writes:\n\n&gt; \"Our army is full of men fresh from lawyers' ships and counting rooms,\" Peter B. Porter lamented, but he was one of them. In December 1812 Major Thomas Sidney Jesup denounced \"the crowd of ignorance &amp; stupidity with which our army abounds.\" Winfield Scott described most of his fellow officers in 1812 as \"imbeciles and ignoramuses.\" A critic assessed a new officer, Robert Leroy Livingston: \"Well known by the name of 'Crazy Bob,' and if throwing Decanters and Glasses were to be the weapons used, he would make a most excellent Lieut. Colonel.\" Lacking self-discipline, officers struggled to discipline their men.\n\nScott, near the beginning of a remarkable career, was the exception that proves the rule, if you'll permit a moderate tangent. The officer who would earn the nick-name \"Old Fuss and Feathers\" would demand \"far more of the men than had any previous American commander,\" Taylor writes:\n\n&gt; Imposing daily drills of seven to ten hours, with weekly parades and inspections, Scott sought to turn civilians into soldiers \"broken into habits of subordination.\" One captain marveled, \"General Scott drills &amp; damns, drills &amp; damns, drills &amp; damns, &amp; drills again.\" And he stemmed desertion by shooting five culprits \u2014 just as any good British commander would do.\n&gt; \n&gt; The troops fell into line because Scott both terrified and thrilled them. He understood that men would take pride in drilling, if they could see progress and if he looked after their well-being. Bullying contractors, Scott procured better food and uniforms than American soldiers were used to. To improve their health, he enforced strict sanitation and hygiene, including bathing three times a week with soap in Lake Erie. His men avoided the dysentery that had afflicted every previous American military camp. \n\nThe test of these competing views came at the Battle of Chippawa Creek, where \"Porter's volunteers broke and ran\" when faced with British regulars. But then Scott's brigade came to the rescue:\n\n&gt; Despite heavy British artillery fire, Scott neatly turned his advancing column into a line, parallel to the British. The two armies advanced to within one hundred yards in an open field, where they exchanged volleys to deadly effect. To (British general Phineas) Riall's shock, the British line crumpled first, as his men broke ranks to fall back, forcing Riall to withdraw across the Chippawa to the safety of his trenches. For the first time in this war, the British in Canada had faced a regular army that had to be taken seriously, a sobering development.\"\n\nThough regular troops acquitted themselves better in the inconclusive fighting on the War of 1812's Canadian front, America's most spectacular triumph in the ground war came from a force made up primarily of volunteers, militia and outright pirates. This was the army led by Andrew Jackson at the Battle of New Orleans. The war-hungry Jackson had raised his own volunteer force at the start of the war, but for political reasons (relating to Aaron Burr's treason trial) was held back from command for most of it. Finally unleashed on the largely unimportant Southern front near the end of the war, Jackson's amorphous army of around 4,000 dug-in fighters beat a bigger British army. Tennessee volunteers had borne the brunt of the assault, though regular army cannons had dealt most of the damage to the advancing British; Taylor argues that \"the victory primarily belonged to the artillery of the regular army rather than to the celebrated riflemen from the frontier.\" \n\nSources: \n\n- Taylor, Alan. *The Civil War of 1812: American Citizens, British Subjects, Irish Rebels &amp; Indian Allies.* New York: Alfred A.

        "&gt; How do you know if your practices are moral if you don't recognize where your morality comes from.\n\nIf you read the line before, you'd see that I did explain where our morality comes from. Please stop re-framing your counterargument. \n\nYou keep insinuating that atheists can't be moral when that's clearly not the case. Like I said, we're not the ones starting jihads or killing in some sky wizard's name. \n\nAlso, that quote is ironic. I said that morality is inferred rationally based on evidence. Evidence being that objectively real stuff that exists prior to interpretation. You can't apply beliefs in the real world and produce reliable results if they aren't inferred from it in the first place. That's where morality comes from. Not people. But people responding to real events. And then coming to a mutual agreement based on social contract. But saying thou shalt not kill because god says so does not teach people to be moral. it teaches them to be obedient. \n\n&gt; That statement is saying that the current cold winters are the aberration. the prediction is for warmer winters and melting polar regions.\n\nThe poles are melting. But global warming isn't a prediction, its an observation. And we observe plenty of aberrations like this due to changing air currents and weather anomalies. \n\nAgain, from the article: \n\n&gt; The flip side of the question, of course, is whether global warming is at least partly to blame for especially harsh winter weather. As we pointed out in a recent EarthTalk column, warmer temperatures in the winter of 2006 caused Lake Erie to not freeze for the first time in its history. This actually led to increased snowfalls because more evaporating water from the lake was available for precipitation.\n\n&gt; But while more extreme weather events of all kinds\u2014from snowstorms to hurricanes to droughts\u2014are likely side effects of a climate in transition, most scientists maintain that any year-to-year variation in weather cannot be linked directly to either a warming or cooling climate.\n\nYou're cherry picking the parts of the article you want to be true, but the article is pretty explicit. \n\n&gt; What happens to a particular species is not morally defined by science. unless you have some moral guidance as to what happens to species, then you're just randomly making things up in an inconsistent way.\n\nThis is another loaded question. You're sewing together terms that aren't being used that way in order to make the counterargument seem absurd. But you're the one whose being inconsistent, not me.\n\nWe do have a moral obligation to protect ecosystems. And I'll tell you the rational reason why. Because if they die, we die. Less diversity means species are more susceptible to disease. Not just animals, but plants too. And you realize that plants produce particulate that seed rain, right? And prevent soil erosion? Ecosystems need to remain diverse in order to survive, and we still depend on them for oxygen and normal weather patterns. Weather on earth is very much a biological process. Free oxygen doesn't even exist in nature. Plants made all of it. \n\nDid you know the Sahara Desert has tripled in size in the last 100 years? Desertification is spreading on every continent. Also, if the climate increases, sea levels will rise, displacing millions of people and straining their economies. And drought and desertification would make equatorial regions uninhabitable, for animals and people. \n\nAnd there's nothing inconsistent about any of this. Its easy to pretend that something doesn't makes sense if you don't want it to listen or do the research. \n\nThe irony behind your loaded jargon is astounding. You question me on my reasons when your only reason is because god says so. You don't know why those things are moral do you? Its just commanded to you. And from my perspective, that makes you the monster. \n\n&gt; Really what you're saying here is that morally we should be rescuing animals\n\nCertainly not. We need to conserve ecosystems, or multiple species working together for the mutual benefit of each other. Not collect them and put them in zoos. \n\n&gt; Does that mean you're a vegan or are you simply trying to save these animals so that you can eat them later?\n\nSo just two more extremes that you pulled out of your ass. How many more times are you doing to do this and make up bs so that your beliefs seem plausible by default? Do you want global warming to happen? You've already stated that \"morally\" we should want this. Why? For your convenience? Because you have money invested in oil? Because you belief the trickle down affect actually works? Or is it because your pastors have money in oil, and they're higher up on your social hierarchy so you have to believe them. Whats moral about any of that? \n\n&gt; This is why a moral philosophy is important and you're not getting that from science\n\nPhilosophy is the study of the nature of knowledge, reality, and existence. Science comes from philosophy. But when you stop basing your claims on real events, its not philosophy anymore, its baseless conjecture. You're not even providing a valid alternative. The commands from your mind control book are enough for you, and that's the problem. By not basing your views on evidence, you're not recognizing the real changes that are happening, or our dependence on the ecosystem that you're happy killing off. \n\nEverything you've said is immoral. And its immoral because you're just making up lies instead of relying on a standard of evidence. You haven't referred to a real event yet, and yet you think its moral to allow global warming to happen. \n\nLike I said, what is this, backwards land? Its your views that don't make sense. You're not even using your terms correctly. ",

With 2-3\" thickness, it acts as a weed barrier (prevent germination), insulates the roots from extreme heat and cold, retains more moisture &amp; reduces evaporation, looks better than bare soil, and can smell good too - pine is my personal favourite. It will seriously save you a lot of time in terms of weeding and watering.\n\n\nAs for plants, luckily, you're just a couple hours east of me so plant suggestions are easy. \n\nYou can replace the barberry hedge with ninebark (Physocarpus opulifolius). It's native, there are many different colours of foliage, they have decent flowers, and you don't have to trim every 2-4 weeks like with barberry. It generally finishes growing by July/August and can then be cut back once. These are tough as nails - they grow in bedrock along the shores of Lake Erie!\n\nI'd recommend dwarf cedars (Thuja occidentalis) over boxwood. Boxwoods have plenty of pests, and are harder to keep looking good. Cedars are tougher, more drought tolerant, have less pests, and are native and so help the local ecosystem. If you let them grow loose, they have a sturdy yet loose appearance. You also get the nice scent.\n\nAs for general shrubs, here are a few attractive, yet tough, selections that I like to use.\n\n* Serviceberry (Amelanchier canadensis) is great for early summer flower and fall colour, plus has delicious edible berries - basically a blueberry tree.\n\n* Red-twig dogwood (Cornus sericea) is very hardy and can be cut to the ground every couple years. Several foliage colours available, and I found out the 'Prairie Fire' cultivar has the most vivid red stems I've ever seen.\n\n* St. John's Wort is another very tough shrub that has both pretty yellow flowers and interesting seed heads afterwards.\n\nThere are several perennials that would fit your bill. Most of these require next to no maintenance and are all drought-tolerant.\n\n* Beardtongue (Penstemon digitalis) has cultivars with dark red foliage and large spikes of flowers in early summer. Great for massed plantings. Dead-head once flowering is done for a better show the next year or leave up for glossy seedheads.\n\n* Creeping phlox (Phlox subulata) is a creeping semi-evergreen groundcover that flowers for over a month right about now. Great for keeping weeds down and reducing mulch needs.\n\n* Stonecrop (sedum) is almost invincible. Flowers in late summer, holds up well all winter. Green, bluish, and purple foliage colours are available.\n\n* Blue False Indigo (Baptisia australis) is a tough one that grows pretty big. 3-5 feet tall big. Large spikes of flowers that can be most colours, with attractive seed pods that rattle around when dried and hold up most of the winter.\n\n* Black-eyed Susan (Rudbeckia fulgida) is a common staple. Spreads fairly quickly and can be more or less ignored while it does its thing. Seeds itself _very_ aggressively, so put it somewhere you want it to fill in.\n\n* Coneflower (Echinacea purpurea) is another commonly used native perennial with many different colours. Very drought-tolerant. Pollinators love the flowers and birds love the seeds. Can be deadheaded to increase reblooming but not necessary. 'Ruby Star' has the largest flowers &amp; growth habit, while 'Pow-wow Wildberry' is smaller, but gets dozens of blooms on a single plant in a rough globe shape. These will also seed themselves readily.\n\nThere are also some ornamental grasses, which you can more or less establish then ignore until spring.\n\n* Little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium) is a native prairie grass. Bluish or dark purple summer foliage, then goes multi-coloured in fall. Great for mass plantings. \n\n* Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) is another dominant native prairie grass. Holds up very well in winter, and very difficult to kill. Many foliage colours available, and gets coloured flowers in mid summer. Unlike the more commonly used maidengrass (Miscanthus), switchgrass doesn't die out in the middle after a few years.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions. Hope this helps!",

        "Boston College offers #24 D. Salter\n\nScholarship\n\nAMIR KERMANI DOES IT AGAIN WHAT A PASS TO TONY MILLER\n\nSalter and his dad had gotten tickets to the exclusive event. Every year, Boston College faced off against Michigan, and it was always one of the most anticipated matches of the season. Last year, they played in front of maybe one hundred thousand penguins. This year on a boat in the middle of windy Lake Erie. Eric Cantona was going mad commentating on the Netflix match, but Salter was transfixed.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s Kermani all the way at the half court line, what is he doing\u2026 Michigan\u2019s defense is coming to get him\u2026 Turner, BUT NO! OH MY WORD WHAT AN ALLEY OOP PLAY. PURE MAGIC FROM THE IRANIAN!\u201d\n\nLast year it was Kermani. The year before it was Mike Taylor and Jackie Richards, all the way to the National Championship Game...\n\n\u201cHere he is, Mike Taylor leading the team that no one thought would make it, they\u2019ve made it all the way to the final four, to the championship game. They\u2019ve picked up an ACC trophy to boot\u2026 and a quick pass to Brad Kinder under the basket who outmuscles the defender and puts it in\u201d\n\nThe last gasp. Then the final four. An elite eight, but the whole team three ACC trophies richer. All lead by some of the most visible point guards in the game.\n\nSalter got the letter in the mail. A wax seal on the back with an ornate eagle blessing the burgundy.\n\n\u201cTo Mr. Devontae Salter, we offer the chance to become the starting point guard of one of the most dominant forces in the ACC.\n\n\u201cWe offer the chance to lead a team of defensive talent in the paint and to champion a team of reliant centers on the offence. We offer the chance to take the captain\u2019s armband in the first game of the first season and lead the line, as our past point guards have done. 30 minutes a game. 35 minutes a game. Double doubles at every opportunity. We offer the chance to grow and develop into a champion. A player who has experience lifting trophies before champagne can flow. A leader who has taken on a deficit in the first half and lead by example, put in every minute and taken the team back into the furor.\n\n\u201cWe proudly offer this chance to you.\u201d\n\nThe letter, as has by now become legend, was handwritten as no other coach letters were. An elegant script in a deep burgundy red, with block letters adorning the top: \u201cFROM THE DESK OF TIMMY BENDIS\u201d. And yet, it was legible. Impressive. Imposing.\n\n\u201cWe expect you to develop. To become an icon in your own position. To follow in the footsteps of the path our previous guards have taken upon themselves. Amir Kermani is only the latest. Mike Taylor has lifted the ACC Trophy in front of adoring fans and the scouts of five different NBL teams. Kendrick McLean did the same. Kermani flashed his Fred Perry #4 on national television 7 times last year and was the #4 pick in last year\u2019s draft. You will be surrounded by talent expecting you to perform, but your performances will be watched by everyone, and the success of this team will be due to your ability and yours alone. Point guards go pro from this team. They always do. They always will.\n\n\u201cYou will have the opportunity to enjoy one of the most picturesque campuses in the world with one of the most active student communities ever collected. Boston College - whose campus has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places - is only the beginning with its 14 000 students. More than two hundred thousands students stretch below the Heights and populate Boston and its surrounding areas. Boston College, with its 3 newspapers, 200 clubs, radio station, and television studio only represent a small part of that. The culture on offer here, with Boston the center of the American Revolution and the Colonial Era impresses historians to this day, with more landmarks than in any other city, and a more historic urban core than even some European capitals. Our live music scene is another can\u2019t miss event - Boston on every respectable concert tour - with venues like the Paradise Rock Club, Wally\u2019s Jazz, and Venu. Besides the endless miles of parks, skiing, and beaches, I make sure we do at least one trip to the Revolution Axe Throwing Club as a team so we can see who the best is at a completely useless, but very cool, skill.\n\n\u201cI mentioned parks and skiing above, but I\u2019ll run through stuff like that again. New England is gorgeous. I, for one, enjoy biking up to Maine for a nice long bike ride and visited a few of our Maine athletes for some time while we had Lonnie Oliver, another pro, play here. Skiing is quite close actually. You can nail your freestyle chops at Blue Hills, just 17 miles away and nearly free tickets - especially for students, or, if you\u2019re down for a short trip, New Hampshire is absolutely stunning and home to Cannon Mountain, itself home to downhill legend Bode Miller. Many of the resorts in the area are actually accessible by Commuter train, impossible in most cities, but easy in Boston. And then you have the local parks. Chestnut Hill, especially the Reservoir, is gorgeous, but there are plenty of other options: Boston Common, the Public Garden, the Rose Kennedy Greenway, and, of course the Emerald Necklace: 1100 acres of connected rowable parks throughout the city whose true glory you must see to believe.\n\n\u201cI know we\u2019re not as close as some other schools, but we\u2019re not overly far away either. Cleveland and Detroit are easy one hour flights away from Boston - both direct - so you\u2019ll be in the area and certainly able to visit your parents fairly often. The tickets are also less than $100, so between car insurance, gas, and tolls, you\u2019ll end up spending less by flying than you would driving to somewhere closer but without an airport as major as Logan. Our huge university network in New England also means that I can absolutely guarantee that many of your friends will be attending school both in the surrounding states and in Boston proper, so you\u2019ll never be too far from that feeling of home. My wife and I also make efforts to make the team feel like a family, which is why so many of them stay on the team for all four years.\n\n\u201cFinally, we win. Not only do we win, we win properly. In the last three seasons, we\u2019ve had the top record in the ACC, and won the trophy, back-to-back-to-back. Few teams can beat our winning record overall, and we are peerless when it comes to winning with a difficult schedule. We only lost one game in conference last year\u2026 the ACC, the strongest conference, and our two losses in one of the most difficult OOC schedules of all time secured our status as perrenial winners. We are always a strong team coming into NT, and hope that we can continue that tradition by playing and beating the best. You can expect that, by coming to Boston College you\u2019ll be winning, not only against teams incapable of scoring, but on National television night , after night, after night. Michigan, Cal, Duke, UNC, Texas, the list goes on. This is a team that will do anything to win.\u201d\n\nSalter finally looked up, the fact that he had been even considered by Boston College was noteworthy. Timmy was courting him, and courting him hard.\n\n\u201cI want you to be a part of this team as it grows around you. We have the most loyal coaching staff - I\u2019ve only ever coached here in Chestnut Hill - but also the most loyal players in the country, and that will give you the opportunity to approach each game intrinsically knowing where everyone will be. Being able to trust everyone on your team. Being able to trust your coach. You belong here, and I would love to have you pull on an Eagles jersey next season.\n\nSincerely\n\nTimmy Bendis\u201d\n\nSalter lied back on his bed in Michigan, dazed, but excited.\n",

        "&gt; It would have been higher had Germany instead replaced the phased-out nukes with coal\n\nDon't you get the point?&amp;nbsp; *Germany was criminal to have phased out nukes, period.*\n\n[Germany has shut down 10,895 MW of nuclear capacity since 2011.](http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-g-n/germany.aspx)&amp;nbsp; At 90% capacity factor, that's 85.96 TWh/yr of emission-free power removed.&amp;nbsp; [That's more than all the lignite and hard coal reductions since 2003 put together.](https://energytransition.org/2018/01/german-energy-consumption-2017/)\n\n&gt;  Instead they filled in the gap and stopped their carbon footprint from increasing.\n\nCreating a \"gap\" should have been a capital offense.\n\n&gt; And capital crime, you say? You're not talking about putting people to death for such \"crimes,\" are you?\n\nSeriously, if climate-change denialists are killing people, Greens are at least as bad if not worse.&amp;nbsp; Greens and their \"no nukes\" predecessors made certain we'd have this problem in the first place, instead of heading it off 40 years ago.\n\n&gt; And for that very reason, renewables and nuclear both have to develop and be deployed in parallel!\n\nYet you're defending nuclear shutdowns?\n\nThe thing most people cannot grasp is that electricity is not storable to any significant degree; you cannot put five gallons of electricity in a can in the garage.&amp;nbsp; The major energy reservoirs (mechanical inertia) of the grid can supply it for mere seconds.&amp;nbsp; The annual product of a 50 GWh/yr Gigafactory, fully charged, could support the US grid for less than 7 minutes of average load and it wouldn't be able to do anything else.&amp;nbsp; This means that unreliable electric generation, like wind and PV, is of very limited actual usefulness.&amp;nbsp; You can paper over their deficiencies by transferring costs but it all comes out in the wash somewhere.\n\nThe upshot is that you either follow demand with some kind of dispatchable generation, have a bunch of \"renewable\" power that you may have to \"curtail\" (throw away) when it's in excess (and pay the producers regardless), or come up with something else.&amp;nbsp; That \"something else\" comes in a bunch of forms.&amp;nbsp; Audi's e-Gas for their G-tron CNG cars is something else, all right.&amp;nbsp; It's an absurdly expensive fuel supply that only the rich could handle without subsidy.&amp;nbsp; If you tried to run on it your industrial economy would quickly collapse.\n\nReally making \"renewables\" useful requires some way to put them to use that can handle the unreliable supply.&amp;nbsp; Critically, it has to be *cheap;* the equipment is going to have to do without power a lot of the time (which may or may not require standing idle), so your capital costs need to be very low.&amp;nbsp; The hypedrogen (yes, they hype it a lot) people say the falling cost of electrolyzers makes THEIR option the obvious one, never mind that hypedrogen has 1/3 the volumetric energy density of methane and can't be stored in any geologic formation with sulfide minerals because it'll come back as H2S.&amp;nbsp; Converting hypedrogen to methane incurs a 22% energy loss, and even if you can use the heat somehow you'll only have it when the methanator is operating.&amp;nbsp; If that's an unimportant use, of what value is the energy?&amp;nbsp; If that's an important use, what's heating it the rest of the time?&amp;nbsp; These questions cannot go un-answered.\n\nI have my own ideas about using electric power surpluses, but here's the kicker:&amp;nbsp; given that nuclear energy can provide surpluses for many more hours of the day, a nuclear-driven system will become economic before any wind- or PV-driven system due to the superior utilization of the capital plant.&amp;nbsp; It won't be subject to the vagaries of the weather, either.\n\n&gt; If you insist on being salty about Germany's nuclear phase-out, take it to the German government or the Germans themselves.\n\nI don't speak German and I wouldn't be able to overcome their paranoia anyway; seriously, they're worried about tsunamis inundating plants on the Danube?!&amp;nbsp; I'm an American and my own best use of my effort is to try to prevent my country from going any further down the same wrong road (that it's been going down for 50 years now).&amp;nbsp; We've had a couple of kicks back toward sanity since 1968 and maybe the 3^rd time's the charm.&amp;nbsp; If I can come up with something that eliminates both \"the base-load problem\" and \"the curtailment problem\" in one stroke, then I won't care if anyone remembers my name 50 years from now.&amp;nbsp; I would be thrilled if they're just using my invention.&amp;nbsp; Of course, I'll be dead by then.\n\n&gt; So they'll just have to build it. A lot of research is being done on how to continually increase the penetration of solar and wind power.\n\nWasting it is costly, and dumping it on neighboring countries will be impossible once the targets install their phase-shifting transformers to block unwanted cross-border power flows.\n\n&gt; Energy storage holds the key to this and there are many frontiers herein from batteries to synfuels to everything in between.\n\nHere's what you don't get:&amp;nbsp; energy storage is a *hard problem.*&amp;nbsp; Storing a couple weeks of electric power for the USA with pumped hydro requires water volume on the order of Lake Erie!&amp;nbsp; Doing this sanely requires some product that is energy-dense and in high demand so you can sell as much of it as you can make.\n\nThe reason fossil fuels are intractably popular is precisely because they are  energy-dense storage media.&amp;nbsp; Uranium is vastly more so, which is why fossil-fuel interests have been propagandizing against it so heavily for all that time.&amp;nbsp; It's not a fossil fuel, it's a stellar fuel.&amp;nbsp; It may have actually been made in the merger of 2 neutron stars, which would make it a fair rarity in the universe.&amp;nbsp; But we are blessed with a lot of it (and thorium), and we should be using it to save our environment.\n\n&gt; So they'll just have to build it.\n\nBuild *what?*&amp;nbsp; When they're destroying carbon-free generation?&amp;nbsp; Seriously, the Germans are collectively insane.&amp;nbsp; It's not like they haven't gone off the rails before.&amp;nbsp; This is just another huge Romantic movement.\n\n&gt; A lot of research is being done on how to continually increase the penetration of solar and wind power. Energy storage holds the key to this and there are many frontiers herein from batteries to synfuels to everything in between.\n\nIf you can't store it there's no point in producing very much of it.&amp;nbsp; If you had the equivalent of energy-pemmican, which can be stored for years, you'd be in great shape.&amp;nbsp; Tanks of hot water are certainly easy to produce but are as perishable as fresh vegetables.\n\n&gt; There are loads of ways to get it done.\n\nWrong.&amp;nbsp; There are very FEW ways to get it done, otherwise it would already be done.&amp;nbsp; This is a **hard problem.**\n\n&gt; They just need a little time to develop into something that will proliferate more quickly\n\nDon't count your chickens before they're hatched&amp;mdash;and I write this as someone setting on an egg.\n",

        "On a foggy June morning, three Land Rovers sped across a tarred road built on what used to be Lake Erie's bed. \n\nIn the lead vehicle, Jeremiah yanked a tissue from the box on the dashboard and blew noisily into it. The noise drew sleepy grumbles from the back seat, until he said, \"Quit complaining, we're almost at the launch site.\"\n\nThe driver, a thickset man in his mid-forties named Oscar, was hunched forward and peering through the windshield. \"Condition's real bad today. You sure we're still gonna fly?\"\n\nJeremiah shrugged. \"Like we got a choice. Used to be we could shower once every three days. Now we either shower after a week, or die of thirst.\"\n\nA large sign materialized out of the gloom, white with large black words \"Retrieval Site D-07\". Shortly after, they arrived at the guard house of a fenced facility that consisted almost solely of helicopter pads.\n\n\"We counting on you,\" the guard said after checking their ID. His voice was hoarse with phlegm.\n\nOscar guided their convoy all the way to the other end of the facility, where three massive King Stallion helicopters were waiting. Each had been retrofitted with half a dozen one-man pods that extended out from the sides and rose several feet above the rotors. From each pod hung several leather sacs, now deflated. For some reason, Jeremiah always thought they looked like overturned bees.\n\nThe Land Rovers swung into their designated parking spots and Jeremiah hopped out almost immediately after. Sally, Huey and Maki shuffled out, rubbing their eyes and yawning. If they were rookies, Jeremiah would've grounded them, but these fellows had all flown several successful missions already.\n\nInstead, he zipped up his jacket, rubbing his hands to dispel the cold that was creeping through his woolen mitts. It was precisely noon, and yet their surroundings lay shrouded in misty shadow. In the distance, on a cliff, he could barely make out the silhouette of Cleveland, though the city's skyscrapers appeared partially clouded by the dust storm that had been ravaging it.\n\n\"Alright folks, you know the drill. Keep the bags up and your heads down,\" he said. \"Go, go!\"\n\nThe crew members scattered to their pods. He clambered up the ladder to his and strapped himself into the spherical chamber. It was cold, and his breath fogged up the glass before his face. Yet he felt comforted by his knowledge of the technology here; it'd been a repurposed deep-sea submarine and everything, from the controls to the robotic claws that gripped each collection bag, was proven, durable technology.\n\nThe rotors roared to life, and soon they were away. He had pointedly avoided looking at the sky until then, but now found he had little else to see.\n\nThere wasn't much a sky, to be honest. A wall--no, an ocean--of water had replaced it. The dark, rolling mass appeared to be an almost solid object, a new crust for an old Earth. Sunlight filtered through weakly in some places, but not enough.\n\nThe barren landscape below was testimony to that. Brown dominated his sight now; the Great Lakes were mostly gone, and once snow-capped peaks now lay gray. Cities remained, little more than steel and stone prisons where people fought for every drop of water the government could spare.\n\nThere were no more living forests that he could see, neither on the American nor the Canadian sides of the border.\n\nHis fingers had tightened so hard on the joystick that he had to force himself to relax. Around him, he could see some of the other collectors looking up nervously as they approached the floating ocean. Nobody knew what had caused rain to stay afloat. Scientists theorized that Earth's gravity had gone to shit, and strange incidences of floating objects had almost given them credence. But nothing could explain why it had happened globally.\n\nAs the reading on the altimeter climbed, Jeremiah mouthed a quick prayer, for himself and for their pilot. It didn't matter if your helicopter fell down or *up* into an ocean; you just hoped enough of you remained in one piece for the rescuers to identify.\n\nUp here, however, there would be no rescue.\n\nHe'd gone on enough runs to estimate when to deploy the bags. As the chopper slowed its approach, he began guiding an arm up. The water, so solid-looking and endless, lay only a few feet away, separated by the glass of his pod and thin air. The pod could afford a plunge into its depths--or perhaps height?--but he preferred a healthy distance all the same.\n\nWorking almost mechanically, he began scooping water into the bag, itself made out of a strong synthetic rubber composite. Strangely, when separated from the rest of its body, the water obeyed gravity readily. Some splashed out of the bag onto his pod, spoiling his visibility, but his experience saw him through.\n\nBag after bag he filled, and though some tension remained in his chest, he found the rhythm soothing. Until suddenly a chorus of panicked shouts burst through his intercom.\n\nIt came from Chopper Three, directly ahead of them. A waterfall seemed to have formed over them. Jeremiah gaped in stunned silence as the torrent slammed into the helicopter and bore it down. The pilot appeared to be fighting to bring his craft under control, but it was no use; the water flipped it over, the rotors went dead, and the aircraft dropped like a stone.\n\n\"Get us out of here!\" he shouted, barely comprehending what was happening. The two remaining helicopters immediately began to descend, but then the unthinkable happened.\n\nA curtain of water formed in the distance, so suddenly, so silently. It fell like a spear, and a city underneath it vanished in the blink of an eye. The water exploded outward in all directions, bearing with it fragments that used to be human civilization, so small as to appear toy-like.\n\n\"God,\" Jeremiah murmured, even as several other streams--they looked so thin and harmless--formed and rained down. The earth shattered from the impact, and even hills and mountains collapsed.\n\n\"What do we do?\" Oscar's voice came, sounding very soft.\n\nJeremiah did not have an answer for him.\n\n***\n\n*Thanks for reading!

        " **Balloonfest '86** was a 1986 event in which the United Way of Cleveland in Ohio set a world record by releasing almost one and a half million balloons. The event was intended to be a harmless fundraising publicity stunt, but the balloons drifted back over the city, Lake Erie and land in the surrounding area, and caused problems for traffic and a nearby airport. The event also interfered with a United States Coast Guard search for two boaters who were later found drowned. In consequence, the organizers and the city faced lawsuits seeking millions of dollars in damages, and cost overruns put the event at a net loss.

        "I-80 across Nebraska is way better than I-70 across Kansas...the Oz Museum may be the only interesting thing along the route (that's a challenge to anyone who can help me make Kansas interesting\u2014I have no problems with I-40/80/90\u2014the only reason I put up with Kansas is because the BBQ in KC is amazeballs).\n\nThe Stuhr Museum of the Prairie Pioneer in Grand Island is excellent. Cleveland and Chicago are great stops if you have time to spend there. I would also recommend taking I-86/NY-17 across Upstate NY over I-80 across PA. I-80 is another one of those repeating scenery routes where you see a lot of the same thing and it gets boring between the Susquehanna River (which is pretty far east) and basically Ohio. I-86/NY-17  takes you through the Palisades, the Catskills, and plenty of other really gorgeous areas along NY's Southern Tier, and then you take I-90 down through Cleveland and on to Chicago. If you haven't been to Niagara Falls, I would seriously suggest that you go, because it's probably the best sight to see in the Eastern US! Another worthwhile detour is to follow OH-2/US-6/Lake Road (which follows the Lake Erie shoreline starting in Cleveland's west suburbs) or OH-2 from Elyria to Sandusky/Port Clinton. You could spend a day at the Cedar Point amusement park (world renowned for its plethora or roller coasters\u2014usually it's voted #1), which is along this route as well. BTW, I'm local to Cleveland, so hit me up if you'd like recommendations for the city. We have great beer, food, museums, and sports, and it's easy to do a lot in a day because we don't have the big city traffic like NYC or Chicago.\n\nObviously Chicago is great, but it's a little out of route with heavy traffic, so it's not a quick stop kind of place. Unless I plan to spend a day or a night in town, or I'm traveling through on I-90 towards Wisconsin instead of on I-80 like you would be, I just head through to save time. It's probably the best city along your entire route, should you choose to go the Northern instead of the Southern route.\n\nDenver is a great city to check out, but honestly\u2014I'd keep it brief and spend more time in the Rockies and in Southern Utah! Hanging Lake is right off I-70 (steel 1mi+ hike) and Colorado Natl Monument outside Grand Junction is along the way. Arches Natl Park is unreal, especially if you can fit in a hike to Delicate Arch. An alternative route to I-70 would be to drop down through Capitol Reef Natl Park and take Utah Hwy 12 toward Bryce Canyon &amp; Zion Natl Parks. The landscape around Capitol Reef and Torrey is positively surreal! Highway 12 is also one of the most beautiful drives in the world! Bryce Canyon and Zion can be enjoyed with a quick stop or a drive, although you'll really want to come back and spend some good time at Zion especially if you're living in the Great Las Vegas area. If you're driving a moving truck, you may want to skip Zion because of the Mt. Carmel Tunnel, which is low clearance.\n\nIf you take I-70 across from Columbus or Dayton, I don't have as many recommendations for you...the Museum of the USAF in Dayton, OH is excellent\u2014rivals the Smithsonian Natl Air &amp; Space Museum. Casey, IL is an interesting but cheesy stop with the world's largest rocking chair, mailbox, pitchfork, and a bunch of other oversized things. St. Louis has the Gateway Arch and the old courthouse, as well as the Chain of Rocks Bridge on Old Route 66. Just east of Kansas City is Independence, MO where the Oregon, California, Mormon Pioneer, and Santa Fe Trails all started West. Joe's Kansas City BBQ at 47th &amp; Mission had the best barbecue I've ever had in my life (been there twice)!\n\nI've spent a lot of time in Columbus, but I really don't find it as interesting as Cleveland or Cincinnati. They have some breweries, but it's hard to go wrong with any of the breweries in Cleveland. Short North is a cool neighborhood near The Ohio State University to check out. I can't say much about Indy since I haven't stopped there much.",

It will dramatically increase where you can go.\n\nOnly flight. Stay with family and borrow their car will be the primary plan. And all-terrain stroller though sounds like a great idea.\n\n&gt; When you get tired of dirt trails, you might want to check out a wetlands park or conversation area. To permit you to walk over the wet terrain, they have boardwalks. A good example is Wye Marsh in Midland. Another example would be the Cyprus Lake trail in Tobermory. Double check which things are open that time of year though. (Both of my examples are open in the winter.)\n\nA quick google search does show many places that close by mid-october. So something open in the winter is great. Will add these to the list.\n\n&gt; I don't know how strict you are about eating a Halal diet. In our cities, there are many options in that regard.

Canada is the second biggest country in the world and distances can be deceiving. For example, it takes 24 hours to drive across Ontario.\n\nUmm... I hadn't realised that. I need to look carefully at the map.\n\n&gt; A note about your daughter being different. I can't tell you that people won't stare or that you won't run into someone who is difficult, but from professional experience, for the most part, you will get a positive reaction with anybody when you can explain your daughter's situation.\n\nNoted :)\n\n&gt; Ontario has a number of children's playgrounds designed to be wheelchair accessible. They are not something you would drive way out of your way for, but can be fun a diversion if you are already in the area. Here is just one example list - https://www.accessibleplayground.net/canada/ontario/\n\nThe kiddo doesn't really play but the sound of other kids playing puts a smile on her face. So if the weather permits then morning walks will be part of the daily ritual. \n\n&gt; With regards to Niagara Falls. Given your comments, it's not a place you would want to spend days, but it really is quite something. At that time of year, there is a Christmas Festival of Lights that is quite beautiful. There is also the Niagara River Recreation Trail that is 56km long and runs between Lake Ontario and Lake Erie. As it's name implies it runs along the Niagara River and Niagara Gorge. The City of Niagara Falls itself is very touristy, but the land along the Niagara River has been government protected and has the feeling of a nice small town park. Unfortunately, the Falls take you in the opposite direction of our wilderness to the North of Toronto, but in Canada you are rarely very far away from a nature experience. As an example, the northern shore of Lake Erie is nice.\n\nI like the sound of a Festival of lights. Since the kids partially blind, bright lights are always a source of entertainment. The Trail seems like a good day to spend walking as well. \n\n&gt; You should know that late November is not the best time of year to see birds in Canada as many of our species fly south for the Winter. However, there is still lots of you can find if you plan your spots carefully. On the plus side, many of our trees drop their leaves make it much easier to spot some birds.\n\nDon't really need to see the birds though I might bring my long tele-lens along just in case. My daughter just loves the sound of birds.\n\n&gt; A comment about snow -- late November and early December weather can be pretty hit and miss for snow in the warmer parts of Canada like Toronto and Niagara Falls. However, a drive of just one hour north can make a big difference. If you have never been to a cold climate before. Try to find some locals where you are now with experience. They will help you with what to pack, or what you may need to plan on buying here. I have seen people over prepare and under prepare. Another option is to post another question here just dedicated to planning for the cold.\n\nYep. Will ask on the local reddit for advice. I've been to Europe a few times so I have a general idea but will mostly pack light and then borrow what we need.\n\n&gt; If you do plan to seek medical advice here, I recommend contacting Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital in Toronto. They specialize in children with disabilities. They will be able to give you advice beyond medical treatment looking at issues like education, life skills and recreation. They might not ultimately, be the best people to see, but they can refer you to other resources if those would be better. Our system is not always set up well for non-residents -- so be persistent as most healthcare institutions do have the ability to provide for-fee services rather than government funded care.\n\nNot really looking at treatment but more like advice and guidance. I'll also look into our insurance provider and see if there is a way I can extend our coverage to North America. And anyway I'm budgetting for the medical side of the trip and if we do find the right people then we will forego the touristy side of the trip (to save cash) and make it all about the medical stuff. :)\n\n&gt; Good luck and welcome!\n\nThank you. :)\n",

        "\n\n\n\n\n- The second largest city, Cleveland, was the most effected city in the state. It was almost completely obliterated when the bombs fell. This city is mostly avoided due to the overpopulation of supermutants and feral ghouls, as well as mirelurks along the coast of Lake Erie. People only go here if they have a death wish.\n\n- However, Akron - 35 miles south of Cleveland - was remotely untouched by the bombs. Akron is a lawless city where nobody has control. Only large groups of raiders call this place home. The only damage that this place has seen aside from the raiders trashing it out is 200 years of weathering.\n\n- To the west 65 miles of those two cities is Sandusky, home of the infamous amusement park, Cedar Point. Cedar Point is now a desolate scrap yard filled with vast amounts of steel from the partially standing steel roller coasters. The peninsula is often raided by steelworkers from the Pitt and is filled with feral ghouls.\n\n- The islands north of Sandusky; Put-In-Bay, Middle Bass, Isle St George, and Kelleys Island, as well as the peninsulas close to them, have become overrun with mirelurks due to the blasts in Cleveland overly polluting the waters of Lake Erie. The resort island Put-In-Bay has the highest population of mirelurks than any of the other islands, due to the vast amounts of rubble they have to scavenge and hide in.\n\n- 60 miles to the northwest of Sandusky is Toledo. This city is on the border of Ohio and Michigan. Toledo survived with only a few blasts in the area during the Great War. Its position along the banks of the Maumee River leading into Indiana and access to Lake Erie has made it a prominent trading hub and port. The main danger of trading here is going through Lake Erie near the islands and peninsulas where the hoards of mirelurks live, but if traders and wanderers who use watercrafts to access the trading hubs in Toledo and along the Maumee River from Lake Erie stay away from the coasts of the islands, they are relatively safe. However, Toledo isn't entirely safe. People who live in Toledo regularly have run-ins with the raiders from the Michigan wasteland trying to gain control over the city and its resources.\n\n- Columbus; Ohio's largest city, located in Central Ohio, is still standing. It has become a large trading hub with inns, shops, and wanderers trading their goods they scavenge from out in the commonwealth. Since it was the largest city in Ohio before the bombs fell, a lot of people decided to call this home even after the bombs fell. It's the one of the safest and most guarded places in Ohio. Raiders and feral ghouls are shot on sight for fear of security breaches and keeping the locals safe.\n\n- 70 miles west of Columbus is the city of Dayton. Before the bombs fell, this was one of the larger cities in Ohio. It was hit hard due to Wright Patterson Air Force Base being in near proximity of the city. The entire city is and still remains in ruins, along with some of the cities nearby; Kettering, Riverside, and Oakwood to name a few. The city is overrun with supermutants, along with other unknown monsters lurking in the Mad River and Eastwood Lake.\n\n- Wright Patterson Air Force Base, located in Fairborn, close to Dayton, is properly equipped and able to deal with any dangers that may come their way. This is why they were able to stay standing when the bombs fell and when the chaos broke loose. The gates have been permanently blocked off, aside from Gate A. The only people allowed in or out are the people's offspring that were there since the bombs fell, either veterans or fleeing citizens looking for cover. The fencing around the base has been reinforced with metal they have stripped from the planes inside and outside of the National Musuem of the US Air Force, located beside WPAFB. The three hangars of the Musuem have since then been turned into living quarters for the current residents. Currently, it is a massive settlement with hundreds of people living and thriving inside these reinforced gates. People here have been trained to handle military equipment under supervision of Military Officials. There are several guard posts around the perimeter of the fence, where people rotate shifts to keep a lookout for supermutants from Dayton, anything crawling out of the Mad River, or raiders attempting to take control of the base. Since it is such a large settlement in what is the most safe and guarded places, they have the equipment to purify a large amount of water at a time and relatively safe food with their large crops.\n\n- Majority of the northwestern cities in ohio are controlled by the Brotherhood, including Lima which is under complete lockdown. This is because of the Lima Army Tank Plant/Joint Systems Manufacturing Center that is located here. They manufactured tanks like the M5 Stuart, M26 Pershing, and M1 Abrams before the Great War. The plant also served as a long-term storage for returning combat vehicles. The Brotherhood wants these tanks and combat vehicles all to themselves to use against the other factions that do not agree with their message.\n\n- The Minutemen hold 3 settlements in the northeast; Ashtabula, Youngstown, and Canton. The majority of the neighboring cities were able to rebuild due to their help, but they have yet to clear out Cleveland and Akron, due to the mass amounts of supermutants in Cleveland, and raiders in Akron.\n\n- Cincinnati, the city to the southwest, was also obliterated when the bombs fell. 3 nuclear bombs hit different areas of the city, which left it a total rubbled wasteland. Perfect for the homes of supermutants. Along the Ohio and Kentucky border is the Ohio River, which is near where one of the Cincinnati bombs fell. Pre-war stories about monsters lurking in the Ohio River were the least of peoples problems now. The fish that survived the radiation and adapted to it were three times the size of what they were pre-war. That means large catfish were now big enough to swallow a human, maybe even a supermutant. Mirelurks roam the shores of Ohio and Kentucky. When the Ohio River floods, this means a larger danger for survivors or people who settled around it.\n\n- Cities and towns to the east of Cincinatti are relatively untouched by damage done by the bombs - leaving small but thriving farming communities. These are rarely talked about as of late, because they usually keep to themselves. No raiders, because they all seem to target the bigger settlements and cities. Any dangers that may come their way are taken care of very quickly due to pre-war opinions on guns in this area. Almost everyone knew how to use a gun, and those who survived the chaos after the bombs fell taught their friends and family who also survived how to use a gun if they didn't already.\n\n# This is from the fan-lore",

        "Ok kids strap in for this one it's a real doozy. This was like October or November-ish. I met this guy from Dubai on Tinder who goes here and he was pretty cute and, like, rich of course. Anyways, it was a Saturday night and he asked if I wanted to watch movies and have some drinks at my place (my double in Danielsen lmao.) I was like hell ya dude that sounds pretty gnar, and after work, I came home, showered, mf exfoliated, redid my makeup, and made myself a qt. My roommate went and stayed with her boyfriend because she's nice like that and this dude came over at like 10:00. He brought a decent sized bottle of Belvedere vodka, which is like $45-ish, so pretty pricey, at least for people our age, and I was just like \"oooo shit\"\n\nANYWAYS, we were talkin n shit and I turned on Parks and Rec because 1. that's some quality television and 2. I only ever watch Parks and Rec and Workaholics lmao. We made some cosmopolitans and were talking over it a bit, and he was cool but also kinda cocky, like he wanted me to know that he's wealthy. Like he asked if I had ever done coke before because all of his friends do it in nightclubs and I was like \"no????? I'm from Ohio, coke there would be laced with fetanyl and it would kill you.\" He also probably thought that I was kind of like a redneck (I mean, I do have my redneck side but it's a good side) or inferior because I'm from Ohio lmao. I'm not even from southern or central Ohio, I'm from northern Ohio on Lake Erie so like... quality Ohio. Anyways, after all that banter, he says Parks and Rec is boring (um) and we turn on Wolf of Wall Street instead. He kept on asking why I wasn't drinking as much as him, and I was just like \"hehe I ammmmm\" even though I'm not stupid and I'm not gonna drink a shit ton when I'm alone with a guy I met on Tinder in my room. It's also extremely noteworthy that he had some edibles with his friends earlier and they were kind of starting to hit him lmao. Fast forward a bit and we're on my bed, y'know, it do be like that sometimes, and he is trying to fuck but he was literally too fucking high to stay hard. It was kind of awkward because he was just like \"Oh I can't do it I don't feel well\" and I was just like \"okay that's fine w/e.\" So we're just kind of laying there and he kept on trying to tell me he was gonna go home and I was like \"dude you have to stay here I can't just let you go home like this.\" He eventually passed tf out and I was barely asleep all night, I slept for maybe 2 hours, and he woke up the next morning and was just like \"oh my god did I fall asleep\" and I was just like \"ya...\" He left a bit later, blocked me on snapchat, and unmatched us on tinder but I literally did nothing to make him do that. He left the vodka tho, and I got to drink the rest of it with my friend, which was HELLA because I don't have a fake or anything and I'm only 20 (but 19 at the time.) \n\nBut yeah that was a whole novel and it was pretty bad lmao he was so fucked up and he was just like \"omg I'm gonna puke\" and I literally said \"you better fucking not on my white sheets I will fuck you up.\" I'm such a sweet gal. I kind of had another almost shitty date once. This guy I met on tinder who goes to NEU and was talking to for like 2 weeks came over one night and I got my period that day but I didn't know what to do because I actually liked him and I didn't want it to seem like I just wanted sex. Anyways, I had to tell him after we were making out for a while, because duh, and he was just like \"oh that's okay don't worry about it\" but then a little later he was like \"oh I have to meet a friend in a little bit, I mean I'm not leaving because you got your period or anything\" and we agreed to meet up again but I guess a week was too long for him to wait and he ghosted me lmao. Hot tip from me to all boys everywhere: don't try to have girlfriends if a period bothers you that much because lmao you will be in for a rude awakening, we cannot control it. Trust me, it is worse for me than it is for you and it is not the end of the world. Don't act like you don't have sisters or moms. \n\nYeah those are my stories I literally sat the fuck down with my laptop to tell them because I love telling them. As a cute, blonde-haired, blue-eyed white girl who is decently thique in the boo-t (not bragging or anything, we all look ugly sometimes lmao) it is not that challenging to find dudes but they also all fucking blow my mind because 1. they do stupid things  2. they think I was born yesterday and that they can get anything past me and 3. they will be all over me for like a week or two and then be like \"toodles\" and I'm just like \"ok who the fugg wants to be my lil boyfriend.\"\n\nAlso, your username earns you some bonus points because I'm a huge Daft Punk fan.\n\n",

        "Public Universities are not community colleges. Public Universities across the board receive taxpayer money, and thus are expected to respect the 1st Amendment. As I've linked above, it is the decision of the federal government that, \"Public universities are barred from protecting some speakers based on a given viewpoint but denying such protection to others.\" They simply have to allow counter protests and are not under any obligation to protect speakers from being shouted down. They also don't have to spend money on physical protection, that's a police matter. It's pretty cut and dry. \n\nYour confusion seems to stem from not knowing what constitutes a public university. I'll use the State of Florida as an example to make it clear to you:\n\nThe State University System of Florida is a system of **twelve public universities in the U.S. state of Florida**. As of 2015, over 341,000 students were enrolled in Florida's state universities. Together with the **Florida College System**, which includes Florida's **28 community colleges** and state colleges, it is part of Florida's system of public higher education. The system, headquartered in Tallahassee, is overseen by a Chancellor and governed by the Florida Board of Governors.\n\n**Here is a list of the 12 Public Universities:** \n\n&gt;1. Florida A&amp;M University\t\n2. Florida Atlantic University\t\n3. Florida Gulf Coast University\t\n4. Florida International University\t\n5. Florida Polytechnic University\t\n6. Florida State University\t\n7. New College of Florida\t\n8. University of Central Florida\t\n9. University of Florida\t\n10. University of North Florida\t\n11. University of South Florida\t\n12. University of West Florida\n\nNOTE: These are NOT community colleges. They are 4 year Public Universities. \n\n**THESE are Florida's community colleges**. You'll notice community colleges are NOT state colleges, although both receive tax payer money and are part of the Florida Higher Education program. \n\n\n\n&gt;1. Eastern Florida State College\n2. Broward College\t\n3. College of Central Florida\t\n4. Chipola College\t\n5. Daytona State College\t\n6. Edison State College\n7. Florida State College at Jacksonville\t\n8.

Lake-Sumter State College\t\n14. Miami Dade College\t\n15. North Florida Community College\t\n16. Northwest Florida State College\t\n17. Palm Beach State College\t\n18. Pasco-Hernando Community College\t\n19. Pensacola State College\t\n20. Polk State College\t\n21. Santa Fe College\t\n22. Seminole State College\t\n23. South Florida State College\n24. St. Johns River State College\t\n25. St. Petersburg College\t\n26. State College of Florida (Manatee Community College)\t\n27. Tallahassee Community College\t\n28. Valencia College \n\n**Lastly, here is a list of all PRIVATE Universities in Florida**. Private universities are not operated by governments, do not receive taxpayer funs or public student loans, and grants. This is in contrast to public universities and national universities. Further, most private universities are non-profit organizations.\n\n&gt;1. American University of Leadership (Orlando)\n2. Argosy University (Tampa)\n3. Atlantis University (Miami-Dade County)[1]\n4. Beacon College (Leesburg)\n5. Carlos Albizu University (Miami)\n6. Columbia College (Jacksonville) (Orlando)\n7. DeVry University (Orlando)\n8. Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (Daytona Beach)\n9. Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (Orlando Satellite Campus)\n10. Flagler College (St. Augustine)\n11. Florida Institute of Technology (Melbourne)\n12. Florida National University (Hialeah)\n13. Herzing University (Orlando)\n14. Hodges University (Naples)\n15. International Fine Arts College (Miami)\n16. Jacksonville University (Jacksonville)\n17. Johnson &amp; Wales University (North Miami)\n18. Jones College (Jacksonville)\n19. Keiser University (Fort Lauderdale)\n20. Key College (Dania Beach)\n21. Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine (Bradenton)\n22. Lynn University (Boca Raton)\n23. Keiser University (West Palm Beach)\n24. Miami Regional University (Miami Springs)\n25. National Louis University (Tampa)\n26. National University of Medical Sciences (USA) (Naples)\n27. Nova Southeastern University (Davie)\n28. Okan International University (Dania Beach)\n29. Rollins College (Winter Park)\n30. San Ignacio University (Miami)\n31. Schiller International University (Largo)\n32. Southwest Florida College (Fort Myers), (Tampa)[citation needed]\n33. Springfield College (Tampa)\n34. Stetson University (DeLand)\n35. Thomas M. Cooley Law School (Tampa (satellite campus of Western Michigan University))[2]\n36. University of Miami (Coral Gables)\n37. University of Phoenix (Orlando)\n38. University of Tampa (Tampa)\n39. Virginia College (Jacksonville)\n40. Virginia College (Fort Pierce)\n41. Virginia College (Pensacola)\n42. Webber International University (Babson Park)\n43. Webster University (Ocala)\n\n\nSo hopefully you have noticed Private Universities, Community Colleges, and Public Universities are indeed different from one another. If you want to only hear one point of view (say for instance you're Catholic) go to a private school that reinforces your viewpoints (Notredame). If you're politically conservative, go to SMU in Texas and study in the George W Bush Library, if you're liberal go to Sarah Lawrence College and ban any capitalist speakers from campus. As private institutions, their say goes. I went to a private university and they banned condoms from being handed out on campus due to religious reasons. Private entities can do set their own rules, and many pay a premium for this experience (don't benefit from a taxpayer funded superstructure). \n\nIf you want to hear a mix of opinions that will prepare you for the real world, a mix of opinions, pay less and go to your local public university. If you want the privilege of an insular learning environment, you're more than welcome to pay for it! But so long as taxpayers make your education affordable at a State University, the first amendment and diversity of ideas will be observed. Of course, campuses have been \"banning\" speakers, but not on the grounds of hate speech, for instance. They'll cite something like \"safety concerns\" for even moderate speakers if a small group of protesters gets vocal enough. Not to mention, it's probably not a good idea to set the precedent that the violent and loud get to direct discussion in this country. That's a pretty cut and dry element of Fascism.  ",

        "So I'm a biologist with a Masters in Plant Genetics. Let me see if I can help out.\n\nWater is a simple molecule first of all, three total atoms. Other liquids like ethanol have more atoms in them (in this case, 9 atoms). The larger you get the tougher it is to move around and 'flow.' Large molecules tend to almost always be solids. So being small is required to be a liquid or gas under most states. Water is also a polar molecule, meaning that the oxygen atom exerts a strong pull on the electrons of the hydrogens. This means that the oxygen is slightly negative, while the hydrogens are slightly positive. Most molecules have pretty even charge distributions so they really don't interact with each other much outside the gigantic pool ball party constantly crashing into each other (when they're liquid). But in water, this 'dipole' allows the positive hydrogens to *briefly* bond to the negative oxygens of OTHER water molecules. This bond is called a hydrogen bond and it gives water several very interesting properties. Firstly, water is pretty incompressible; water at the bottom of the ocean (4-5km down) is only 1.8% more compressed than water at the surface. Most other fluids will compress more than that. Also as water gets colder the hydrogen bonds slow water molecules down and orient them into a crystal lattice. The *length* of the bonds in solid water are longer than in liquid water. This means that 100 solid water molecules will occupy more space than 100 liquid water molecules (or we can say ice has a decreased density). So when water freezes it floats instead of sinking, like most other substances. And since water floats, ice can create a protective buffer against cold temps that keep undelrying water from freezing. Lake Erie freezes on the surface in winter, but after 5-6 feet, the remainder of the lake is liquid year-round. So that liquid water can keep doing what liquid water does. Due to the amount of energy it takes to break apart water molecules hydrogen bonds, water tends to stay liquid at relatively high temps. To contrast, methane is a small molecule. It's melting point is -182C and a boiling point of -164C! So methane is always a gas on Earth and anything that dissolves itself in liquid methane is going to far to cold to do any type of chemical reaction. Water on the other hand is just hot enough that chemistry proceeds pretty rapidly. \n\n\nNext, atomic bonds AND hydrogen bonds are both present. Some water molecules naturally dissociate into a proton (H^+ ) and a hydroxide ion (OH^- ). These excess protons can attach to water molecules making *hydronium ions* so the acid-base balance of water is right around pH7 because both hydronium and hydroxide ions are present **and** transient. If the pH was too high or low, all sorts of molecules would be irrevocably changed by being in water then. And because ALL of these (water molecules, hydronium and hydroxide ions) carry charges, they can interact with **all** charged ions and polar molecules. And most of the molecules you know are either ions or polar: glucose, other sugars, proteins, amino acids, sodium, potassium, chloride, etc. Therefore, water is going to be an excellent solvent AND won't change the chemical makeup of substances that dissolve in water.\n\nIn terms of biochemistry, water is also super-useful because it can dissociate into a proton and a hydroxide ion. All of the reactions we use to build complex macromolecules in our body: polysaccharides from sugars, proteins from amino acids, triglycerides from glycerol and fatty acids, all of these create water as a product. The reaction is called a dehydration synthesis because the two molecules are being joined by removing a water molecule from them. This is always done by creating a bond by removing an -OH from one molecule and a -H from another molecule. The molecules get glued together and the -H and -OH are combined to form water. This new water molecule can then join all of it's buddies in the solution that is surrounding this reaction. We can also run the reaction in reverse, take a water molecule and use it to break apart large molecules into two smaller molecules. This reaction is known as hydrolysis (hydro- for water; -lysis means to cut or puncture). In both cases we either create water molecules or take them from the surrounding environment. And since all of these biochemical reactions are bathed in water, both reactions are very easy to pull off.\n\nIn sum, water is an ideal fluid. It's incompressible, hard to change temperature, holds heat very well, is relatively well organized, dissolves many substances with ease and due to its polarity can be useful for interacting with other substances or performing several types of chemical reactions that are central to our biochemistry. No other fluid has ALL these perks or benefits. Many have one or two, some have a bunch, but water is the only molecule able to do what water does. Hope that helps!",

        "OH SHIT SON Ontario is my location and native/pollinators are my specialty. I'll update this post momentarily with some nice stuff. Everything I list will be native and/or pollinator friendly unless I specify otherwise.\n\n**Perennials:**\n\nPenstemon (Beardtongue): Flowers early summer, including white, pink, purple, red, and even true blue. Foliage can be green, dark red, or purple. My personal favourite is '[Dark Towers](http://www.terranovanurseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Penstemon-Dark-Towers-1-510x510.jpg)', with dark reddish-purple foliage and pink flowers. Part to full shade; loves heat and clay. I use these in lieu of Iris.\n\nEchinacea (Coneflower): Flowers mid-summer in every colour except blue. Will re-bloom if dead-headed, and most self-seed if left over winter. However, many can be treated as annuals as they're hybridized from Mexican varieties. 'Ruby Star', along with the 'Magnus', 'Pow-wow' and 'Sombrero' series' are reliable. Sun and part shade; tolerates clay.\n\nPhlox subulata (Creeping Phlox): Semi-evergreen groundcover flowering for over a month starting mid-spring. Comes in white, pink, red, striped, and various shades of purple. I prefer '[Emerald Blue](http://www.danzfamily.com/archives/blogphotos/14/125-emerald-blue-creeping-phlox.jpg)'. Next to invincible and not invasive. Sun or part shade, doesn't care about soil type.\n\nSedum (Stonecrop): Very tough plant that grows anywhere except heavy shade. Great for winter interest and holds up in snow. Tends to flop if overwatered. Comes in green or purple foliage with pink flowers. Not native, but bees absolutely _love_ the flowers to the point where you can't even get near them there's so many.\n\nGeranium (Cranesbill): Low-growing but vigorous plant that flowers all summer. May get ratty part-way through the season, in which case it can be cut back to the ground and it just starts over again. Full sun or part-shade. Non-native but bees like it. Best cultivar available right now is '[Rozanne](http://northcoastgardening.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/geraniumrozannewithacorus.jpg)'.\n\n**Shrubs:**\n\nCornus sericea (Red-twig dogwood): Very common and almost overused. New cultivars 'Midwinter Fire' and 'Prairie Fire' are compact and have vibrant red stems.\n\nAmalanchier (Serviceberry): Very tough flowering shrub, commonly used in shopping plazas. White flowers in early summer and  edible berries mid-summer that the birds will fight you for. Excellent fall foliage. Comes in multi-stem or small tree form. Prefers full sun but tolerates part shade.\n\nIlex verticillata (Winterberry): Deciduous holly that gets covered in red berries come fall. Birds love this. Does not care about soil type and will tolerate moisture. You will need 1 male plant for every 3-5 female plants. 'Red Sprite' is a solid dwarf cultivar.\n\nPhysocarpus (Ninebark): Tough as nails shrub that grows in bedrock on lakeshores. Used mainly for foliage, which comes in purple, yellow, orange, and more. Flowers for a few weeks mid-summer. Prefers full sun or part shade. Can be hacked back down to the ground and comes right back up.\n\n**Grasses:**\n\nPanicum (Switchgrass): One of the dominant prairie grasses, you can still see this growing along lakeshores. I've seen lots along Lake Erie. Does not die out in the middle like Miscanthus and doesn't grow as wide. Foliage colour varies from blue, green, brown, and red. Flowers of various colours in late summer. Holds up with snow, laughs in the face of clay, but prefers more sunlight or it may flop.\n\nSchizachyrium (Little bluestem): Another prairie grass. About 2/3 the size of Panicum. Foliage is green, blue, or dark purple. Fall foliage looks like a fiery rainbow. Full sun or part shade. Best used in massed plantings.",

        "I am a baby boomer. What has struck me since the 80's and the movie \"Wall Street\" and the phrase \"greed is good\" is that the 60's and early 70's there was the whole hippie movement with the emphasis away from materialism and going back to nature and peace and all that good stuff - all the California liberal shit and yet somehow, all of that went to hell and suddenly, my generation flipped completely to getting everything they could. We did clean up a lot of pollution believe it or not. When I was young, you couldn't swim in Lake Erie safely for instance. Our generation has pushed for recycling etc. too. There were great advances for women and minorities too. And yet, the major corporations - the rich people - somehow managed to make us want so much \"stuff\" to stimulate the economy as the carrot - easy credit available - after the recession in the 70's when baby boomers couldn't get jobs even with their degree. Women went to work so families had more money to spend. Homes got bigger. \"Designer\" clothes became a thing. (previously, they were just considered \"quality\"). Advertising went from \"here is a great product you might like\" to \"if you don't buy this, you are loser\". TV and movies showed \"normal\" lifestyles that no \"average\" person ever lived yet they were presented as such - making people uneasy about there place on the ladder of success. Books came out telling us we could do better, be happier, make more money - all the self-help shit and even though most were hardly accredited, we ate it up. During the recession, good paying jobs began asking for the college degrees because they could. They'd have so many applicants that, in order to weed people out, they could ask for the degrees and skim the cream. It's not entirely true, of course, but it's one way to weed out most of the riff-raff. My father, for instance, did not have a university education but apprenticed as an accountant and wrote his exams and got his licence. He actually complained when the rules changed because the degreed apprentices thought they were all that when they still knew nothing - it was actually harder to teach them. Unions also had various industries by the balls and asked for ridiculous wages for unskilled labour. The North American Unions cared nothing about the business end of things and priced their labour out of the market and caused corporations to look elsewhere for cheaper labour. Why would you pay one bozo $30-$60 an hour when there was someone out there willing to work for $2 or less? \n\nOrdinary baby boomers had very little power. Yes, they got caught up in materialism just as their parents had and just as the younger generations are now - there are a lot more cool things out there to want. Your generation laughs at mine with our slowness to pick up new technology but we are now trying to get rid of shit so our families don't have to tackle a hoard when we die - we have lived so far without the new goodies and it's harder to learn new things with a declining brain. You too will deal with this.\n\nThere's a lot of hate for baby boomers but really, we are no different than you. You want things and when you have money, you will likely but those things. Your generation does have a lot more than we did growing up. There are simply more things to have and they are cheaper than before so people have more. As a teen, I literally had 2 pairs of jeans, a couple pair of dressier pants, a week or so of seasonal tops and one pair of runners and maybe one pair of good shoes (we didn't dress up much). I had tons of space in my tiny closet and small dresser. And I had more nicer clothes than many of my peers. I was envied. We didn't have cell phones and the like. A 2nd phone extension or a 2nd bathroom or 2nd tv were the things people were anxious to get. I was allowed a calculator for math in grade 13. That calculator cost me $100 at a time when I made $2 an hour part time. I paid $40 for what today would be designer pants - about $20 for levis jeans. \n\nIt is tempting to blame baby boomers just as we blamed our parents but the problem is really corporations - they have no morality or ethics because their only real motive is to increase profit. That is the mandate for any generation working for them. They advertise in ways that make us afraid if we don't have whatever they are selling. Maybe your generation can reign them in. Ours definitely has not.",

These projects expand access and protect the birds, lands and waters that we all love, while also growing local economies.\"\n\n&gt; Wetlands provide many ecological, economic and social benefits such as habitat for fish, wildlife and a variety of plants.\n\n&gt; NAWCA grants conserve bird populations and wetland habitat, while supporting local economies and American traditions such as hunting, fishing, birdwatching, family farming and cattle ranching.\n\n&gt; Missouri Coteau Habitat Conservation XVI: $1 million to conserve 3,503 acres of wetlands and grasslands for waterfowl, songbirds and other species in North Dakota.\n\n&gt; Lake Erie Coastal Wetlands II: $1 million to restore, acquire, and conserve 2,765 acres of forested, shrub, and other wetlands in Ohio, which serve as wintering, breeding or migration habitat for green-winged teal, gadwall, black ducks and many other species.\n\n&gt;

Since many of America's birds spend part of their time in other countries, NAWCA provides grants to Canada and Mexico as well, to ensure waterfowl and other birds are protected throughout their lifecycles.\n\n&gt; The commission approved $26 million for 17 projects in those countries.\n\n&gt; NAWCA is the only federal grant program dedicated to the conservation of wetland habitats for migratory birds.\n\n&gt; Since 1989, funding has advanced the conservation of wetland habitats and their wildlife in all 50 U.S. states, Canada and Mexico while engaging more than 5,700 partners in over 2,700 projects.\n\n&gt; More information about the grant projects is available here.\n\n&gt; The commission also approved more than $9.8 million from the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund to conserve 5,628 acres for two national wildlife refuges.\n\n&gt; These funds were raised largely through the sale of Federal Migratory Bird Hunting and Conservation Stamps, commonly known as \"Duck Stamps.\"\n\n&gt; \"The Duck Stamp program has an eight-decade track record of success,\" said Zinke.\n\n&gt; \"These refuges and many others across the United States demonstrate how the millions of dollars that sportsmen and women contribute to the program add up to more wildlife and more places for all Americans to enjoy.\"\n\n&gt; Funds raised from the sale of Federal Duck Stamps goes toward the acquisition or lease of habitat for the National Wildlife Refuge System.\n\n&gt; Duck Stamps - while required by waterfowl hunters as an annual license - are also voluntarily purchased by birders, outdoor enthusiasts and fans of national wildlife refuges who understand the value of preserving some of the most diverse and important wildlife habitats in our nation.\n\n&gt; The Catahoula Refuge project will maintain the existing public recreational access for big game, upland game and waterfowl hunting and eliminate the need for the Service to secure, develop and maintain new access routes to existing refuge lands.\n\n&gt; The Turnbull Refuge project will enable the Service to conserve and restore wetlands and expand recreational access within one-quarter mile of the refuge's headquarters.\n\n&gt; Since 1934, the Federal Duck Stamp Program and Migratory Bird Conservation Fund have provided more than $1 billion for habitat conservation in the Refuge System.\n\n&gt; The FWS is responsible for managing 566 national wildlife refuges and 38 wetland management districts spanning 150 million acres across the National Wildlife Refuge System.\n\n&gt; Refuges offer world-class public recreation, from fishing, hunting and wildlife observation to photography and environmental education.\n\n&gt; More than 53 million people visit refuges every year, creating economic booms for local communities.\n\n&gt; The commission also approved a resolution recognizing the contributions of Senator Thad Cochran to migratory bird conservation.\n\n&gt; Before retiring on April 1, 2018, the Senator served more than 36 years on the commission, overseeing conservation of 2.4 million acres of waterfowl habitat in national wildlife refuges, and approving NAWCA grants for public-private partnerships that have conserved, restored or enhanced 30.7 million acres of wetlands and associated uplands across North America.\n\n&gt; The Migratory Bird Conservation Commission is chaired by the Secretary of the Interior.\n\n&gt; The commission has helped in conserving much of this nation's most important waterfowl habitat and in establishing or enhancing many of our Nation's most popular destinations for waterfowl hunting.\n\n&gt;

        "Honestly you could spend weeks checking everything out, if you're willing to drive an hour or so south of the coast. It depends on how much time you want to spend. There's a lot more stuff in NE Ohio in particular than people realize. I'll just list my favorite notable stuff along the lakeshore, east to west, some of it will overlap with what others have said. \n\n-Erie, PA - I thought the Great Lakes Maritime Museum was pretty cool, and if the Niagara is in port (check ahead) you can get a look at a replica War of 1812 ship. That stuff (maritime artifacts, history, etc) is kind of my wheelhouse though. Presque Isle State Park is worth a drive through, they have a lighthouse and some pretty views of Erie. Erie Harbor is worth a look too. \n\n-Ashtabula County, Ohio: As someone else mentioned, hunting for covered bridges is actually really fun. Finding all of them can take hours, however. Feel free to inbox me if you want recommendations on which ones to see, or if you just want a taste, the Harpersfield Covered Bridge is about five minutes from I-90 and is one of the prettiest ones. \n\n-Madison, Ohio/Geneva, Ohio - Also mentioned, this is the wine region of the area, if you're into wineries and stuff. \n\n-Mentor, Ohio - President James A. Garfield house\n\n-Kirtland, Ohio - Kirtland Temple, the first temple built by the Latter Day Saints. About a mile off 90\n\n-Cleveland: Cleveland Museum of Art, which is probably most people's choice for the top attraction inside the city. The Rock Hall is up there too, and the Botanical Garden, the Natural History Museum, and the Cleveland History Center/Western Reserve HS are recommendable as well. Right by those is Lakeview Cemetery, which is the resting place of John D. Rockefeller, Elliott Ness, and James A. Garfield. \n\nPlayhouse Square is worth seeing a show in if you have the time, or see if they're doing tours. There are the sports teams if you have time to do that, too. West Side Market is good for an hour or so stop, fun little place and you can get you some nice food there. Others will say the Christmas Story house but I've never been there. \n\nCheck to see if the Terminal Tower observation deck is open and you can get tickets for that. Haven't been on a boat tour in forever, but see which of those are available. \n\nThere are maps to more attractions and r/Cleveland, give those a look. They have some oddball attractions listed there, like the contraceptive museum (yep that's a thing) and the money museum.\n\n-Charming lake towns worth moseying on into: Geneva-on-the-Lake, Fairport Harbor, Vermilion, Huron. The latter three have lighthouses. Within driving distance of Fairport is Painesville Township Park, which just installed a beautiful 200-foot pier out into the lake, and then further east is Lake Erie Bluffs, which is a nice quiet lake park for a walk with an observation tower. \n\n-In Sandusky, Cedar Point is a world-class amusement park as others have mentioned, and the islands of course. See Marblehead Lighthouse if you're in the area of the islands, it's a big pretty one. Others have mentioned the Edison house, which is on my list of stuff I need to do but haven't. \n\n-Toledo - Museum of the Great Lakes - Another maritime museum, this one focused more on the lakes themselves than the one in Erie, which has a War of 1812 focus. Has pieces of shipwrecks inside, including the Edmund Fitzgerald, and you can also take a tour on a steamship. \n\nI've never been to the Glass Museum or Art Museum in Toledo, both sound cool. \n\n-Detroit: Detroit Institute of Art is a must-see, probably more than any other museum on the list. Cleveland Museum of Art isn't too far behind, but Detroit's collection of paintings and the Diego Rivera murals are awesome and worth the drive from Buffalo alone. \n\nBelle Isle is pretty, give that at least a drive-through. \n\nDetroit is one of my current undertakings in terms of discovery, so there's much there I've yet to do and a lot of stuff there to see. The Motown Museum, African-American History Museum and Henry Ford are on my list, although if you're going to go to Motown, don't do what I did and drive all the way up there only to find out they've stopped booking tours for the day. Call ahead for tickets :) \n\nSo there's some things off the top of my head. I'm not sure how long it would take to see all those but several days at least. ",

Emilia, the woman he\u2019d woken up next to, one arm flung around her stomach as though they\u2019d been married for years, had screamed and spoken loudly in angry Italian for what felt like hours that morning, but after he had managed to guess the password on one of the computers in the house (it had been \u2018passw0rd,\u2019 so not exactly secure), they\u2019d managed to figure out what had been going on after many social media posts and gratuitous use of google translate.\n\nPrior to the shuffling, Mark had taught English to eleventh graders. He had fallen asleep in California, going over his lesson plan for Act Three of Hamlet, and had woken up in Canada, on the coast of Lake Erie. The cottage that had shitty Wi-Fi and a beautiful view of the sunrise had looked like it had been built by the two hands of the body Mark was currently inhabiting, which was the source of his fascination with them.\n\nThey were, objectively, the part of his body that passed into his field of view most often, so he should have gotten used to them by now. But Mark couldn\u2019t remember the last time he did a day\u2019s worth of manual labor, so his hands had been relatively smooth, the only real blemish a slight callous from spending too much time holding a pen. The hands he was in control of now were at least twenty years older than him, and look as much like they had built the cottage as the cottage looked like it had been built by them. They were tough, strong hangs, and Mark, like much of the world, was still getting used to gripping things correctly. He still felt clumsy holding pens.\n\nFrom what Mark and Emilia could find out, the bodies they inhabited belonged to a couple who actually had been married for years: Daniel and Marybeth Johnson. Based solely on the information that could be gleaned from their house and their bodies (well-worn furniture, what felt like hundreds of pictures of grandchildren, wedding bands with inscriptions that had been worn down over the years) it seemed like Dan and Beth had had an idyllic life and were well on their way to living out their happily ever after. Mark didn\u2019t like to think about where they could possibly be now.\n\nTrying to return home was not extremely feasible for a number of people. First and foremost, airline pilots had, unfortunately, not been spared from the Shuffling, and there were very few people willing to trust that a complete stranger with no means of authentic identification was able to fly them where they needed to go. Secondly, there was the question of what one did when one actually made it home. Do you kick out the person who has your face that is living in your home? And how do you contact your family? How are you supposed to know where they had gone?\n\nInfrastructure had also begun to break down almost immediately. It was impossible to assume that anyone was qualified to the jobs that needed to be done, since it was relatively easy to lie about who you had been in your Original Body. After they had established communication, Emilia had had the brilliant idea of raiding a grocery store, and their stores of canned goods had proven to save their lives since there had been no news of any food deliveries since the Shuffling.\n\nA network of programmers had immediately hopped back on the internet and breathed life into Twitter and Facebook, so those who had functioning computers and generators, like the people inhabiting the bodies next door, were able to keep in touch with their loved ones. Mark had been able to log into his accounts and make contact with his brother, who had landed in China, and his aunt, who had ended up in Germany. He didn\u2019t get to speak to use the computer often, since the neighbors were trying to conserve fuel, but when he logged on there was usually a message or two from them waiting for him.\n\nHowever, as time passed and no Second Shuffling happened and no cosmic \u201cundo\u201d button was pressed, Mark began to get more and more stressed out, and not even messages from his family helped. Winter was on its way, and with the electricity as good as gone and not nearly enough fuel to get them through the cold months, Mark and Emilia had set a date to leave. There were rumors of settlements in the south, people coming together to get communities up and running again. The two of them were already packed and ready to go. There had never been any intention of them splitting up; neither of them said it out loud, but they both knew they didn\u2019t have the heart or the necessity to split up Dan and Beth\u2019s bodies. If things ever did go back to normal, no matter where his own body was, Mark thought that they deserved to be together.\n\nSo every morning Mark woke up in this old man\u2019s body next to a woman whose language he was still struggling to fully understand, and every night he went to be reviewing his lesson plan for Hamlet Act Three, hoping against hope that he\u2019d have a chance to use it again.",

        "You need a ton of money to do this in the coastal cities...those are super expensive in no time! Especially NYC and SF. I would concentrate my focus on seeing the parks, and I'd spend more time West of the Mississippi than East...it should save you a ton of money on accommodations, especially if you camp.\n\nNow I know a lot of people are going to poo-poo the Midwest and the Great Plains and rave on how awesome the Southeast is. I'm here to tell you that the mountainous areas, especially the Rockies all the way to the coast are the most interesting, and then the Appalachians, and then honestly I think the Great Lakes states have way more to offer than much of the Southeast. The Great Plains will really surprise you sometimes too, even though the scenery is mindnumbingly dull at times. I don't think there's any part of the country that's not worth seeing, but I do think that some stuff along the East Coast is totally overrated...I mean, what's the difference between one town with beaches, hotels, strip malls, golf courses and retirement homes versus the next one except for the name?\n\nSo pick the coolest places and prioritize. Take the coolest drives. But don't take all of them, because you honestly will find more interesting/unique things along Lake Superior, the Mississippi River, or in Western Nebraska than you will along large swaths of beach communities. And there are some places miles from the beach and cities that will really show you a whole other dimension of the Southeast.\n\nThere are some obvious cool things to see in the West, but here are some of what I think are better kept secrets, many of which happen to be in \"flyover country\" (I hate that term!)\n\nGreat Plains:\n\n\u2022 **The Black Hills**  Everyone knows about Mount Rushmore, but it's overrated compared to the natural beauty, scenic drives, and hiking in the area. You could spend the better part of week here visiting Custer SP and its bison herds, hiking to the tallest peak East of the Rockies, visiting waterfalls in Spearfish Canyon, exploring Wind Cave and Jewel Cave, and checking out the Mammoth Site in Hot Springs. Don't miss Devils Tower on the northwestern edge of the Black Hills in Wyoming.\n\n\u2022 **The Wildcat Range**  Western Nebraska and SE Wyoming are full of incredible rock formations, especially along the North Platte River, which also happens to be the route of the Oregon, California, and Mormon Pioneer Trails used to settle the West in the 19th Century. Highlights include Scotts Bluff and Chimney Rock. Carhenge isn't far to the northeast in Alliance, NE.\n\n\u2022 **Theodore Roosevelt National Park and the Little Missouri River** in Western North Dakota offer some beautiful badlands formations and also have wild horses and bison that roam.\n\n\u2022 **Michigan's Upper Peninsula** has spectacular scenery, especially along Lake Superior. The water in Lake Superior is also exceptionally clean. Don't miss Pictured Rocks or Taquamenon Falls. There's plenty more beyond these though. There are lots of places to explore in the Lower Peninsula too, so check that out.\n\n\u2022 **Ohio** has several nooks and crannies to check out. The big cities, especially Cleveland, Cincinnati, and Columbus offer more than people expect for far less money than Chicago or the East Coast cities...and less traffic too. But the Lake Erie Islands are cool, Cedar Point is an iconic roller coaster park, and you don't want to miss gems like the Museum of the USAF, Cuyahoga Valley National Park and especially Hocking Hills State Park. Hocking Hills has the best hiking in the state, and several parts feel like you are in a fantasy world. Old Man's Cave feels like Rivendell.\n\n\u2022 **Kentucky** has the Bourbon Trail, the longest cave system in the world in Mammoth Cave, and the Corvette plant and museum in Bowling Green...among other things.\n\n\u2022 **The Ozarks** feel like mountains, but they aren't quite that big. It's peaceful and beautiful here though.\n\n\u2022 **Northern Wisconsin and Northern Minnesota** offer plenty of scenery with their lakes and rolling hills. The bluffs along the Mississippi River look more like mountains, and much of the Great River looks more like a giant lake.\n\n\u2022 Everyone knows about the beaches, NASA, and Disney in **Florida** but they also have the oldest city in the country, St. Augustine. There are still tons of old buildings that date back hundreds of years in the city's old town. Key West also has a unique flare to it. Another big surprise in Florida is the numerous springs and the crystal clear streams and rivers flowing from them. Rent a small boat and go up the Silver River to Silver Springs near Ocala. Before you take the boat out out, go downstream and see where the crystal water flows into the mysterious Ocklawaha River, and take that for a while. Watch out for logs though! The Ocklawaha is one of the wildest rivers in the Southeast, and was a big part of the adventure of visiting Silver Springs even for wealthy industrialists 100+ years ago. And this is just one of many springs throughout the state. You can also canoe Juniper Springs Run through wilderness in Ocala National Forest.\n\nAnd I'm not kidding when I say it could take you a year to plan this sort of trip. Don't try to cram too much in at once. Your biggest tool for planning your time should be the weather. The desert and the Deep South can be oppressively hot in summer, the season in the Rockies, Cascades, and Sierras is extremely short...basically just summer months, and winters across the Northern Plains, Great Lakes, and New England can be bitterly cold...and then the West Coast is nearly perfect all year. Have an overarching plan of which region you want to be in at what time of year and prioritize the things you want to see most. The rest you can plan on the fly probably. Don't drive too much freeway (and don't drive through the night) if you really want to see the country. Way more interesting things are far from freeways, even in Eastern states, but especially in the West. You get to see more things that aren't in all the tourist literature, but probably could be if they were more accessible.\n\nHave fun!",

Once in the soil, glyphosate tightly sorbs to soil particles and especially for soil oxides and hydroxides . This high affinity for soil particles limits glyphosate\u2019s mobility in the environment, a property considered to be beneficial, since it makes glyphosate somewhat \u201cenvironmentally benign\u201d. Phosphate, present in fertilizers, competes with glyphosate for binding sites of soil micelles. Under most conditions, phosphate is preferentially sorbed, the presence of which may remobilize previously-bound glyphosate\n\nok, so there's that...\n\nand..\n\n&gt; Glyphosate in soil is degraded by microorganisms\n\ntoo busy now to dig up studies on glyphosate's effects *on* soil microorganisms (right now), but /r/glyphosate ..

One study conducted by the EPA over six years found glyphosate in seven groundwater samples out of 27,877 samples tested, with a maximum detected concentration of 1.1 \u00b5g\u00b7L\u22121 [79].

The study was performed in Aquic Argiudoll soil (Tezanos Pinto series). Four treatments were assessed on three dates of rainfall simulation after fertilizer and herbicide application. The soluble phosphorus in runoff water was determined by a colorimetric method. For the determination of glyphosate and aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA), a method based on fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (FMOC) group derivatization, solid phase extraction (SPE) purification, and ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) was employed. **The application of phosphorus fertilizer resulted in an increased loss of glyphosate by runoff after 1 day of application.** These results suggest the need for further study to understand the interactions and to determine appropriate application timing with the goal of reducing the pollution risk by runoff.\n\n",

        "Any of the Three Cs are great cities...the traffic and cost of living will be a walk in the park compared to Chicago. I'm in North Olmsted, one of Cleveland's outer ring west suburbs, and I grew up in Wellington, which is a small town with plenty of cornfields on what is considered the fringe of the Greater Cleveland area. I have friends I see frequently in Columbus, and my wife has family in the Cincinnati area. The three cities are quite different from each other in many ways, and some of the smaller cities around can have some pretty wild shifts from their nearest neighbor.\n\nOf the three, Columbus seems to have the best economy...a lot of that has to do with having a combination of being the seat of state government, having the ginormous Ohio State University, and it *not* having the size or the manufacturing base that CLE &amp; Cincy had...so it had more room to grow itself out over the last 50 years. While there are a few historic neighborhoods and there is an actual downtown, it's not very dense or historic as either Cincinnati or Cleveland. There's stuff to do there, and some of it (like the Columbus zoo) is really top tier, I don't think it's got as deep a set of cultural amenities as Cincy or Cleveland since it's only recently grabbed the spot for largest city in the state, while Cincy and Cleveland go back as metropolises for well over 100 years. The city does have some nice parks and great neighborhoods, and there are plenty of jobs in insurance, but the traffic is way worse than Cleveland at rush hour and the public transportation really sucks.\n\nCincinnati is an old Ohio River town that has a completely different feel with lots of cool and historic neighborhoods. It has the most interesting terrain and has some great parks with great hills, cliffs, and views. I definitely think it has the prettiest skyline, and has a rich history with some very cool cultural amenities, although they aren't quite as big or as high quality as Cleveland. The public transportation here still isn't great, but the city has managed to get a new street car line going in Downtown and Over-the-Rhine. Cincy seems to have a good arts scene, and the economy is probably so-so...but I'm not as familiar with it as other areas of the state. I know Proctor &amp; Gamble is big in the area, and Fifth Third Bank is headquartered here, which is the largest in the state. Cincinnati also has by far the mildest winter weather and the most sunshine.\n\nCleveland I think has the best cultural scene...while it is now no longer as great as it used to be, especially economically, there's a lot of big city amenities like you'd have in Chicago or New York, but on a bit smaller scale and without all of the traffic and extreme costs of living. Northeast Ohio by far has the best public transportation in the state, with both Cleveland and Akron as well as some surrounding counties having excellent service into the larger employment centers, especially Downtown Cleveland...although public transportation here is nowhere near as extensive as it is in Chicago. Traffic is a breeze though...rush hour has a few bottlenecks in different spots, but it doesn't last long and it's nowhere near as problematic at Chicago, and it's better than Cincy or Columbus. Akron barely has traffic at all, unless you live there and work in Cleveland, then there are more slow spots. There are still a few Fortune 500 companies remaining in the area...and there are lots of engineering and tech jobs...although the economy is still on the soft side here...it's nowhere near as robust as Columbus. And while the population loss Cleveland has had in some parts of the city has knocked it down from just short of a million residents and being the 5th or 6th largest city in the country back in 1920 or 1960, a lot of the history and cultural amenities from that heyday remains. The Cleveland Museum of Art is world class and admission is free thanks to an endowment, the Cleveland Orchestra is still revered as one of the world's best, playing a winter series at beautiful Severance Hall and summers at Blossom Music Center, nestled in the Cuyahoga Valley National Park. University Circle has plenty of other cultural institutions and is one of the densest cultural districts in the country. Downtown Cleveland still has some 100-plus year old architecture like the Arcade and the Cleveland Trust Rotunda, and has a burgeoning and rebounding Downtown with a growing residential population, with a handful of entertainment districts in and around it. Theater is alive and well with the country's second largest theater district in Playhouse Square, as well as other institutions in the neighborhoods and suburbs. There are several good neighborhoods outside Downtown seeing a renaissance, although it can't be ignored that crime can definitely be a problem just a couple blocks away in some of these areas. While the city has its issues, the vast majority of Cleveland's suburbs are very safe. Inner ring suburbs like Lakewood and Cleveland Heights have some very cool areas with lots of great bars and quality restaurants. Cleveland has developed a strong food and beer scene in the last 15 years, although the beer scene has certainly developed all across Ohio. I'd say Cleveland and Akron &amp; the counties around them have the best park systems in the state. It's easy to find hiking, kayaking, and bicycling here, and some trails go on for dozens of miles. I'd say Cleveland's biggest downside is the weather...winters are not as cold as Chicago, but much colder than Cbus or Cincy, and the clouds generated from Lake Erie leave winters shrouded in a seemingly never-ending overcast. This does bring lake effect snow in huge quantities to areas east of Downtown, which makes winter on the east side much different from life on the west side. \n\nThere are pros and cons to each major city, and there are plenty of small towns and cities worth a look too...some of which are as close as suburbs in Chicago are to downtown. You can live in a rural area in Cleveland (and I'd imagine this is true in Cbus and Cincy too) and still be within 30 minutes of Downtown even at rush hour! Cities like Oberlin, Yellow Springs, Wooster, Mount Vernon, Delaware, and Medina are interesting little places to live that are legitimate small towns and cities. I think you really need to come and spend some time here to see what you think of areas that interest you first hand. There's a decent variety. Cincinnati being on the edge of the Midwest feels like it comes with half a dose of Kentucky and Appalachia, while Cleveland will probably feel the most like Chicago culturally, having a Northeastern look with a Midwestern style. Meanwhile Akron, just 30 miles or so south, at times will make you wonder how West Virginia's largest city ended up so far north. Then Columbus has a decidedly central Midwestern culture. I'm sure you could find a house and a job and an easier life in any of these cities, it's just a matter of seeing which one you like best. Ohio has surprisingly strong wages for much lower costs of living so long as you have some sort of skill in demand.",

        "**8. New Jersey**\n\nI will admit there is probably some bias that comes here, with it being my home state for my whole life, but I do think it has a lot of merit on its own.\n\nFor starters, as with Connecticut, the location of NJ is arguably the best in the country. You\u2019re never more than a two hour drive from New York or Philly, both of which are great, and Boston, Baltimore, and DC aren\u2019t that far either. It\u2019s also small enough that you can drive through the whole thing in a couple of hours, and everything is very compact. This also means you always have relatively easy access to the other stuff we have here; our Six Flags is a top 3 park in the country, the Jersey Shore is well-known for a reason with boardwalks, beaches, etc. Atlantic City is there if you\u2019re into gambling, the Meadowlands is here, and more. There\u2019s really everything you can imagine in terms of diverse people, diverse land, and diverse ways of life.\n\nHistorically, New Jersey has had plenty of importance; Washington crossing the Delaware is one of the most iconic images of the revolutionary war; Thomas Edison invented the lightbulb here; and we also have two of America\u2019s oldest colleges in Princeton and Rutgers (who played each other in the very first college football game). It\u2019s home to stadium that both the NY Jets and NY Giants play at, and was the setting for The Sopranos, another show considered to be among the best ever.\n\nNJ\u2019s survivor pool is pretty solid. It includes Ramona, Mitchell, Michelle Tesauro, Mia, Judd, Pete Yurkowski, Eddie, Gervase, Cliff, Tony, Natalie/Nadiya, Michele, Will Wahl, Ryan, and Chrissy. While there are some duds in there, we have three of the most recent winners and a few other finalists, big mid jury personalities in Pete and Judd, and dog bar. Terry is also from NJ initially and grew up in the same town I grew up in, so that\u2019s another solid edition.  \n\nAnd yeah, 3 winners is big. Only California has more (Massachusetts also has 3, with Ethan, Boston Rob and Jeremy).\n\nNew Jersey has its flaws \u2014 a lot of people here are kind of assholes (although the stereotype in the media is seriously overblown\u2026 like the people always thought of Jersey Shore but like nobody here actually talks and acts like that), I don\u2019t know how to pump my own gas even though I\u2019ve been driving for 5 years and jughangles are fucking obnoxious, we just had a governmental election where one of the candidates had like half her platform based on how it\u2019s so expensive to live here\u2026 but the good definitely outweighs the bad and #8 seem fair for it.\n\nFor more, check out [this](https://imgur.com/RC76Amj), because it describes what New Jersey is like way better than I could.\n\n**7. Ohio**\n\nOhio is a very solid above average state, delivering in pretty much every area you can ask for, with big cities, industry, and plenty of things to do. It notably has a huge political influence \u2014 it\u2019s been a bellwether for every year since 1960. So in a lot of ways, Ohio represents the typical American, as shown by its wide spread of urban, suburban, and rural populations.\n\nOhio is home to 6 presidents, the most of any state besides Virginia, and was one of the first states to go from US territory to an actual state, being 4th after the original 13 colonies. \n \nFrom an entertainment perspective, Cedar Point is seriously incredible, not only is it home to by far the best collection of roller coasters in the world, but the setting on Lake Erie gives it a sense of charm that you really don\u2019t get anywhere else. Easily the best park I\u2019ve ever been to and I\u2019d love to go there again someday. Despite the lack of success of the Cleveland Browns, the football hall of fame is located in the Cleveland suburb of Canton, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is in Cleveland as well. Cleveland does still have the more successful Cavaliers and the Indians, who haven\u2019t been successful, but do have a loyal and passionate fanbase who deserve better, putting aside [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Cent_Beer_Night). Ohio State is also one of the most well-known colleges in the midwest, for its great academics and athletics, and it has 7 other FBS colleges, the most of any state besides Texas. \n\nOhio has a solid collection of Survivors, with Lill, Chris, and Caryn as the key standouts, with Margaret and Michelle Yi in the next tier. It does have some duds (Kim Mullen, Candace, Marisa, Matt Bischoff), but some of those duds showed some flashes and may have been better on a different season, and the first three are definitely enough to make up for it.\n\nOhio is just all around really solid with a lot of influence and cool places and things to do, so it lands at #7.",

        "Let's see. I'll say first and foremost that I am neglecting large parts of Canada and Mexico but that is because I my history and geography degrees specialized on the United States.  \n  \n**The Republic of Seara**  \nThe Republic of Seara is located in the southeastern United States. It's western border is the Mississippi River beginning at the Southern Sea (Gulf of Mexico) at New Orleans. The border then runs up the Mississippi River to Tennessee River and follows its northern branch (Holston River) into the Appalachian Mountains. The border then goes south-southeast to the Cawtaba River, which it follows to the Atlantic. It also has ownership of the islands of the Bahamas, Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola, and Puerto Rico.  \nIt's capitol is Columbus (in today's Georgia) located just south of the Fall Line on the Chattahoochee River. It is known as an agricultural and mining nation as well as a nation of paradise for tourist who wish to travel to it's white sand beaches and island destinations.  \n  \n**Great Chesapeake**  \nGreat Chesapeake borders the Republic of Seara to the north. It starts by following the Cooper River starting at the Atlantic Ocean and follows Seara's border to the Appalachian Mountains, there it hits up with Appalachia. The border then follows the Appalachian Mountain range north until it hits Spruce Knob. The border then goes directly north to the Potomac River at Cumberland. From there, it follows the river downstream to Cumberland where it meanders along several small creeks and streams northeast until it hits at the confluence of the Black Valley Creek and the Raystown Branch of the Juanita River. It then follows this to the Juanita River and then onward to the Susquehanna River to the Chesapeake River. It also owns the tiny island of Bermuda.  \nIt's capital is Richmond which is inland up the James River. It's economy is centered around agriculture, timber, and mining.  \n  \n**The Commonwealth of York**  \nThe Commonwealth of York takes up the northeastern border of Chesapeake. It starts at the Susquehanna River at Chesapeake Bay and heads upriver to the Juanita River, over to the Raystown Branch of the Juanita River and then follows that until it starts. At that point, it heads straight south to where the Flaugherty Creek and the Casselman River meet at Meyersdale (Pennsylvania) where it then follows the Casselman River west to the Youghiogheny River. It continues on it's course to the Monongahela River until it hits the Ohio River. It then then heads up the Allegheny River up to Warren (Pennsylvania) before turning up Conewango Creek up to the Cassadaga Creek and then on the Chadakoin River. It follows the Chadakoin River to Chautauqua Lake where it then crosses straight northwest to Lake Erie. It then runs from the center of Lake Erie northeast to the Niagara River and into Lake Ontario where it then enters the St. Lawrence River where it then deposits out in the Gulf of St Lawrence and then the Atlantic Ocean. It includes Newfoundland.  \nThe capital is New York City. It is a technological and business based nation with timber being it's primary raw resource.  \n  \n**The Republic of Michigan**  \nThe Republic of Michigan border starts where Yorks territory points off at the start of the Ohio River where they Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers meet. It then follows the Ohio River to the Mississippi River. The Mississippi River is then followed upstream to Lake Bemidji. From there it goes straight to Lower Red Lake and onward to Lake of the Woods. It then follows the current US-Canada border back to Lake Erie.  \nThe capital is Chicago. A once timber rich nation, it now specializes in agriculture and business.  \n  \n**Appalachia**  \nAppalachia is a small landlocked nation it sits between the Ohio River to the north, the Tennessee River to the south and west, and the Appalachian Mountains to the east. It borders Seara, Michigan, Chesapeake, and York.  \nIt's capital is Boone (present day London, Kentucky). This landlocked backwoods nation has few exports other than distilled alcohols, timber, and agriculture. It was created as a buffer zone between Seara/Chesapeake and Michigan.  \n  \n**The Kingdom of Texarkana**  \nThe Kingdom of Texarkana starts of the Mississippi River and follows it until the Arkansas River. It then follow the Arkansas River to it's source where it turns straight south to the source of the Rio Grande River. It follows the Rio Grande to Southern Sea (Gulf of Mexico).  \nThe capital is Dallas. The economy is centered around oil, cattle, and various agriculture. It's status as a kingdom sets it apart from the other nations.  \n  \n**Plains Republic**  \nThe Plains Republic is a landlocked nation located to the north of the Kingdom of Texarkana and west of the Republic of Michigan. Its western border is the Mississippi River down to the Arkansas River which then follows to the source of the Arkansas. From there, an overland hop is taken to Turquoise Lake to Lake Fork and onward to Glacier Creek. Another overland hop is taken to Ivanhoe Lake where the border then follows Ivanhoe Creek to the Fryingpan River. The Fryingpan River is followed to the Carbon Canal (fictional canal to create border) which empties into the Crystal River at Carbondale (Colorado). The Crystal River then turns into the Roaring Fork River and onward to the Colorado River at Glenwood Springs. It then turns downriver where it meanders to the Green River. It then follows the Green River up until it is just east of Hoback Peak where it the border then cuts west between Hoback Peak and Mt. McDougal. It then meanders through the valley on the west of Deadman Mountain to the Snake River at the Palisades Reservoir. From there it heads west until it hits Henry's Fork which it then follows to the Madison River. Once it is on the Maidson River, the border travels to the Missouri River. It then turns south of Helena On the Helena Canal (fictional canal) to Clark's Fork. It follows Clark's Fork to Clark Fork River. It then follows it to the Flathead River which it follows to the Canadian border. The northern border is the Canadian border.  \nThe capital is Omaha. It specializes in agriculture, mining, and some timber.  \n  \n**Newzona**  \nNewzona is a landlocked nation in the desert between the Pacifica Republic, the Plains Republic, and the Kingdom of Texarkana. The Rio Grande River serves as it's eastern border. The Colorado River serves as it's northern and western border. The original Mexico border serves as it's southern border.  \nThe capital is Phoenix. The region is a wasteland and is considered a border nation between Texarkana and Pacifica. The region's deserts serve to stop the two nations from fighting. It's primary export is glass and energy from the dams on the Colorado River with the assistance of the Plains Republic.  \n  \n**Pacifica Republic**  \nThe Pacifica Republic makes up the remaining territory. It is buffered by the Plains Republic to the north east and Newzona to the southeast. It's northern border is with Canada but it has taken the territory west of the Colorado River including Baja California from Mexico. It does also include the territory of Hawaii.  \nThe capital is San Francisco. The nation is know for it's technological prowess and various tourism spots but it huge energy needs have turned this nation into the pariah of the new nations and lead it constantly into war to acquire new resources.  \n  \n_____  \nWell thats it everyone. I am planning on developing an Alternate History timeline series in the future around this sort of a concept starting with an earlier Civil War fracturing the US so this concept came easily (except for all the darn river names and their exact movements with others). As you can tell, there are some alliances (Chesapeake-Seara) and rivals (Chesapeake/Seara vs. Michigan, Texarkana vs. Pacifica).  \nHere is a map if you wish to see it: [Imgur link](https://imgur.com/a/nRt3v)",

        "I just moved from the great lakes to the east coast ... and I'd strongly recommend you reconsider that idea :) The storms on Lake Erie where I sailed the most are just crazy. I wouldn't say they are worse than those on the ocean; they are different - and they come up fast. I had a crazy experience in my little boat (a 27' pocket cruiser) on Lake Erie a couple summers ago where I was caught out in a storm. A tornado-like funnel hit the water quite a ways from me - it turned a boat over with a family of 5 in it. I heard their distress call and the coast guard responding. I read on the news they were all saved. I've seen worse storms on the ocean in terms of size and power, but nothing that moved so fast. \n\nThe bad thing around the great lakes is the winter. The lakes are fresh water and freeze over. So you only have about a 6 month season there. There are lots of sailors that made it across an ocean and died in the great lakes - they have a museum in northern Ohio about all the ship wrecks there.\n\nMy \"new\" boat is 32' on deck, 11' beam. It's a double-ender, cutter rigged. It's tough and built to go through hell. But here's something the boat salesmen never mention: most boats can handle way more weather than most sailors. You have to train - and I don't mean classroom training (although that's good too), you have to get out there and experience it. Most boaters just go out when the weather is nice, but if this is your bug-out-boat, you need to be an all weather boater. My firstmate hasn't been around sailing much and she is still getting used to it; this past summer we were off the coast of NJ during hurricane Irma and even though we were a long ways from real danger, the waves picked up, came around on the nose and it was really uncomfortable for a while. Even though she got seasick, she loved the trip overall and is looking forward to our next one.\n\nThere are lots of great books on seafaring - and read those - but you just have to train and get out there and try things. Do man overboard drills (with a float, not your ex-wife!). Watch out for lightening - it can take out your nav systems - always want backups for that, keep a handheld GPS in a safe place where lightening can't get to it. Get a water proof box for keeping extra batteries for GPS, handheld radios, etc. The SHTF with regularity on the sea. \n\nLooks like you are a DIY'er - if you don't have it yet, pick up Don Casey's \"Complete Illustrated Sailboat Maintenance Manual\" - even if you are getting a power boat. Very little of the book is specific to sails; he talks about fixing fiberglass, wiring, diesels ... hooking up solar and wind power systems ... all sorts of stuff.  Worth its weight in gold. He wrote another great book is called \"This Old Boat\" - about restoring old boats.\n\nA pet peeve of mine with preppers is when they think they can just go buy a boat, stuff it with a bunch of stuff and they are ready. They are in for a big surprise. If a boat is going to work as a 'bug out' vehicle, a person needs to train and train on it - and not just when the weather is nice. Just imagine a wild fire raging ... and a prepper deciding to evac via his boat - seems like a good idea, but the reality is you probably have reduced visibility with smoke in the air, and if your boat has much draft and you have to stay in a narrow channel - you run a big risk of running aground and getting trapped. A boater that's trained well will know how to handle low visibility (the fog in SF bay can be a challenge sometimes and a training opportunity).\n\nOne thing I recommend is always try to have a way to do things if your electric systems aren't working. Salt water and electronics do not get along well and there are lots of boats who have lost their electronics underway. Knowing how to use a sextant and having one could save your life. Marine radar can be invaluable in low visibility, or if you have to leave at night. But it takes a lot of power, and in my experience, it seems to break a lot - so knowing how to use your depth sounder, having paper charts and knowing how to use them is essential. If your sounder goes out? use a rope with a lead weight, with knots tied at regular intervals, you creep forward with someone on the bowsprit ... knowing how to do those things are important; hopefully you never need them.\n\nPeople whose only experience with GPS has been through google maps or a car GPS are in for a big surprise with a chartplotter. Things move around water much faster than charts are updated. Just last summer I was in upstate NY coming south through the canals headed for NY harbor; I had a narrow channel to stay in or run aground - (my boat draws 5') - and my chartplotter shows that I'm 200' west of the channel in the middle of a farm field. Weather was good and I could clearly see the channel markers, so no big deal - but when if it was really foggy or lots of smoke from a wild fire, after dark, and i tried to steer based on those flawed charts?\n\nSailors become tuned to the weather. We always try to pick a good weather window when making a crossing or even just moving the boat to the next port of call. But if it's your escape vehicle, what are the odds the weather will be good when you need it? \n\nGreat question, good luck with it.\n\nEdit: typos and for clarity.\n",
