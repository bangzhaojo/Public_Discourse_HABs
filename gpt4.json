Their diet is primarily rodents, but they will also eat frogs, birds, and their eggs. Lake Erie/Lake Michigan populations are particularly fond of rodents, with some individuals subsisting almost entirely on voles (*Microtus*).\n\n*P. vulpinus* are habitat generalists and use prairie, meadows, marshes, fens, agricultural land, sand dunes, oak savanna, and woodland. Lake Erie/Lake Michigan populations utilize similar habitat, but are more strongly tied to marshes and other moist, grassy areas.  They sometimes turn up in residential and even urban areas in some parts of their range, especially in the suburbs of Chicago.\n\nA closely related and morphological similar species, the Western Foxsnake *Pantherophis ramspotti*, ranges west of the Mississippi River, and the two are known hybridize in a narrow zone along it.\n\n[Range Map (Species Complex) - *P. vulpinus* dark](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Map-depicting-the-approximate-distributions-of-the-two-foxsnake-mtDNA-lineages-as_fig1_258402898)  |  [Range Map (Individual) - \u00c2\u00a9 Rune Midtgaard](https://repfocus.dk/maps1/TAX/Serpentes/Colubridae/Pantherophis_vulpinus_map.html) \n\n[Relevant/Recent Phylogeography](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258402898_A_Reevaluation_of_the_Status_of_the_Foxsnakes_Pantherophis_gloydi_Conant_and_P_vulpinus_Baird_and_Girard_Lepidosauria)\n\n*This short account was prepared by /u/fairlyorange and edited by /u/Phylogenizer*.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nLike many other animals with mouths and teeth, non-venomous snakes can use them to bite in self defense. These animals are referred to as 'not medically significant' or traditionally, 'harmless'. Bites from these snakes benefit from being washed and kept clean like any other skin damage, but aren't often cause for anything other than basic first aid treatment. Some snakes use venom from front or rear fangs as part of prey capture and defense. This venom is not always produced or administered  by the snake in ways dangerous to human health, so many species are venomous in that they produce venom, but considered harmless to humans in most cases because the venom is of low potency, and/or otherwise administered through grooved rear teeth or simply oozed from ducts at the rear of the mouth. Species like Ringneck Snakes *Diadophis* are a good example of mildly venomous rear fanged dipsadine snakes that are traditionally considered harmless or not medically significant. Many rear-fanged snake species are harmless as long as they do not have a chance to secrete a medically significant amount of venom into a bite; [severe envenomation can occur](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23800999) if some species are [allowed to chew on a human](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S004101011831016X) for as little as 30-60 seconds. It is best not to fear snakes, but use common sense and do not let any animals chew on exposed parts of your body. Similarly, but without specialized rear fangs, gartersnakes *Thamnophis* ooze low pressure venom from the rear of their mouth that helps in prey handling, and are also [considered harmless](https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/05/theres-no-need-to-fear-that-garter-snake/). Even large species such as *Malayopython reticulatus* [rarely obtain a size large enough to endanger humans](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/108/52/E1470.full.pdf) so are usually categorized as harmless.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n*I am a bot created for /r/whatsthissnake, /r/snakes and /r/herpetology to help with snake identification and natural history education.

        "I think water quality has improved tremendously over the last 50 years. No river fires!\n\nLake Erie's dead zones are smaller than they used to be, and most of the lake can support higher orders of life, like fish, for much of the year. In general, biodiversity in the Great Lakes is tanking due to invasive species from bilge and ballast water from international ships, and oxygen levels are an issue due to agricultural runoff, but those things don't necessarily harm people. Carcinogenic industrial pollution is a lot lower (mercury and lead, for example), and my impression is that e. coli contamination from sewage overflow is gradually decreasing.\n\nI think the worst carcinogens that we're still ramping up in our waterways are PFAS chemicals. There are several thousand compounds, and we've done careful safety studies on like seven, all of which were found to be extremely carcinogenic, so companies had to add a couple atoms here and there to make replacement compounds that aren't proven to cause cancer. Many others seem likely to be similarly hazardous to the ones we have studied, but it would take several decades and billions of dollars to confirm that, which isn't going to be done, so for now we're encouraging companies to relocate here to dump as much as they want wherever they want, except for the seven we studied. That's why the government advises against eating fish caught in the Huron River.\n\nAnd Michigan remains pretty obstinate regulating safety levels for known and probable carcinogens. Although five years ago they reduced 1,4-dioxane's limit in water from 85 ppb to 7 ppb. That's an important one for Ann Arbor, as we have tons in our groundwater, and the higher pollution allowance was among the many barriers to slowing its spread.",

The peaches (right now, even), grapes and tomatoes are amazing.  Most stuff you can\u2019t find here you can get online, it\u2019s missing an asian market an Indian restaurant, a White Castle, Long John Silver\u2019s, a Polish deli, and an indie movie Theatre. \n\nThis is the first city that I lived in that didn\u2019t have a TV station, at first I thought that was odd, but now I\u2019m used to it.  And standard Chinese food isn\u2019t available.  Still exploring, especially with vegan options turning up here and there.  \n\nThere is manufacturing in the area, lots of people work in surrounding towns, or people from surrounding towns work here.\n\nAlso it can be impossible to get an Uber, not so many drivers here.  I think public transportation is getting better and they are paving new sidewalks where there were none.   Downtown is being renovated, I wish the food were better.\n\nIt\u2019s about equidistant from Cleveland and Toledo, one hour away to either.  CLE is the closest major airport, you can fly out of DET but it\u2019s about a 2-3+ hour drive.  There is I-80 that connects these three places East to West, but no one major highway that goes south from Sandusky to Columbus, it\u2019s three hours away.  You\u2019d think \u201cColumbus Ave.\u201d would lead to Columbus, but it doesn\u2019t, it doesn\u2019t really even point to Columbus.  \n\nOh also \u201cMilan\u201d of Milan Road (SR 250, with Walmart, home depot, etc) is pronounced \u201cmy-lann\u201d, not like Milan, Italy.  And Meijers grocery on 250 has a Tesla Supercharger, not terribly close to the highway, but it\u2019s not necessarily hidden.\n\nAlso I think real estate is reasonable here, things are going up, as always.  Outside of downtown has old historic houses and downtown has renovated lofts.  Outside of downtown are suburban plots.\nPerkins township is known for having good schools, so I hear.  \n\nAlso Sandusky is on migratory bird paths so it can be a good place for birdwatching.  There are some bald eagles living close to my neighborhood.  It\u2019s a wooded marsh so wildlife is around.mayflies swarm once a year, that took some getting used to.  I hear fishing is great here, not just off a boat.  \n\nIt gets snow but being directly south of Lake Erie, the\nmoisture from the lake gets dumped on Cleveland rather than Sandusky from the West to East weather.  Summers can be hot and humid, seems like plenty of precipitation.  \n\nLake Erie sits about 600 feet above sea level and Sandusky is right there, I believe that lets the water table to be low enough to build basements without worry.\n\nThat\u2019s all I can think of, if I\u2019m wrong, anyone please let me know.

Theres actually so many that the air smells like fish.\n\nPleasant Beach (I think its called Elko now) and Turkey Point are my go to. There is temp and wave height info online, the water is only a degree colder than the warmest spot in the lake, and free parking is plenty past 4PM even on Sat.

Their diet is primarily rodents, but they will also eat frogs, birds, and their eggs. Lake Erie/Lake Michigan populations are particularly fond of rodents, with some individuals subsisting almost entirely on voles (*Microtus*).\n\n*P. vulpinus* are habitat generalists and use prairie, meadows, marshes, fens, agricultural land, sand dunes, oak savanna, and woodland. Lake Erie/Lake Michigan populations utilize similar habitat, but are more strongly tied to marshes and other moist, grassy areas.  They sometimes turn up in residential and even urban areas in some parts of their range, especially in the suburbs of Chicago.\n\nA closely related and morphological similar species, the Western Foxsnake *Pantherophis ramspotti*, ranges west of the Mississippi River, and the two are known hybridize in a narrow zone along it.\n\n[Range Map (Species Complex) - *P. vulpinus* dark](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Map-depicting-the-approximate-distributions-of-the-two-foxsnake-mtDNA-lineages-as_fig1_258402898)  |  [Range Map (Individual) - \u00c2\u00a9 Rune Midtgaard](https://repfocus.dk/maps1/TAX/Serpentes/Colubridae/Pantherophis_vulpinus_map.html) \n\n[Relevant/Recent Phylogeography](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258402898_A_Reevaluation_of_the_Status_of_the_Foxsnakes_Pantherophis_gloydi_Conant_and_P_vulpinus_Baird_and_Girard_Lepidosauria)\n\n*This short account was prepared by /u/fairlyorange and edited by /u/Phylogenizer*.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nLike many other animals with mouths and teeth, non-venomous snakes can use them to bite in self defense. These animals are referred to as 'not medically significant' or traditionally, 'harmless'. Bites from these snakes benefit from being washed and kept clean like any other skin damage, but aren't often cause for anything other than basic first aid treatment. Some snakes use venom from front or rear fangs as part of prey capture and defense. This venom is not always produced or administered  by the snake in ways dangerous to human health, so many species are venomous in that they produce venom, but considered harmless to humans in most cases because the venom is of low potency, and/or otherwise administered through grooved rear teeth or simply oozed from ducts at the rear of the mouth. Species like Ringneck Snakes *Diadophis* are a good example of mildly venomous rear fanged dipsadine snakes that are traditionally considered harmless or not medically significant. Many rear-fanged snake species are harmless as long as they do not have a chance to secrete a medically significant amount of venom into a bite; [severe envenomation can occur](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23800999) if some species are [allowed to chew on a human](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S004101011831016X) for as little as 30-60 seconds. It is best not to fear snakes, but use common sense and do not let any animals chew on exposed parts of your body. Similarly, but without specialized rear fangs, gartersnakes *Thamnophis* ooze low pressure venom from the rear of their mouth that helps in prey handling, and are also [considered harmless](https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/05/theres-no-need-to-fear-that-garter-snake/). Even large species such as *Malayopython reticulatus* [rarely obtain a size large enough to endanger humans](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/108/52/E1470.full.pdf) so are usually categorized as harmless.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n*I am a bot created for /r/whatsthissnake, /r/snakes and /r/herpetology to help with snake identification and natural history education.

        "Wow, I had to go back and look at my social media posts from 2016, to see where we went, because I couldn't remember the name of the resort! My memory is going in my old age! Lol. \ud83d\ude33\n\nIt was Paradise Beach in Cozumel. It had a beautiful pool area. The food was good, but a bit pricey, and I think they had a per person minimum spend. \n\nThe beach was a bit disappointing. The water was rather murky and there was a lot of seaweed, plus the sand was tan, not white. I live not far from Lake Erie, so I can see tan sand anytime. Lol. We spent most of our time at the resort in the pool vs the beach. \n\nI don't remember exactly how much we spent. Maybe $200 for the four of us (me, husband, son and daughter, who were 13 and 18 at the time), for admission, food, non alcoholic drinks, for our daughter, snorkeling equipment. Plus whatever we spent on the taxi there and back. \n\nNassau had a much prettier beach, with turquoise water and white sand. We walked to Cable Beach in Nassau. Just gorgeous! We didn't swim there though, because it was late December, and we weren't sure if it would be warm enough.",

        "Eastern Foxsnakes *Pantherophis vulpinus* are large (91-137cm, record 179cm), harmless ratsnakes native to the US Midwestern states east of the Mississippi River, and southern Ontario in Canada. Their diet is primarily rodents, but they will also eat frogs, birds, and their eggs. Lake Erie/Lake Michigan populations are particularly fond of rodents, with some individuals subsisting almost entirely on voles (*Microtus*).\n\n*P. vulpinus* are habitat generalists and use prairie, meadows, marshes, fens, agricultural land, sand dunes, oak savanna, and woodland. Lake Erie/Lake Michigan populations utilize similar habitat, but are more strongly tied to marshes and other moist, grassy areas.  They sometimes turn up in residential and even urban areas in some parts of their range, especially in the suburbs of Chicago.\n\nA closely related and morphological similar species, the Western Foxsnake *Pantherophis ramspotti*, ranges west of the Mississippi River, and the two are known hybridize in a narrow zone along it.\n\n[Range Map (Species Complex) - *P. vulpinus* dark](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Map-depicting-the-approximate-distributions-of-the-two-foxsnake-mtDNA-lineages-as_fig1_258402898)  |  [Range Map (Individual) - \u00c2\u00a9 Rune Midtgaard](https://repfocus.dk/maps1/TAX/Serpentes/Colubridae/Pantherophis_vulpinus_map.html) \n\n[Relevant/Recent Phylogeography](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258402898_A_Reevaluation_of_the_Status_of_the_Foxsnakes_Pantherophis_gloydi_Conant_and_P_vulpinus_Baird_and_Girard_Lepidosauria)\n\n*This short account was prepared by /u/fairlyorange and edited by /u/Phylogenizer*.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nLike many other animals with mouths and teeth, non-venomous snakes can use them to bite in self defense. These animals are referred to as 'not medically significant' or traditionally, 'harmless'. Bites from these snakes benefit from being washed and kept clean like any other skin damage, but aren't often cause for anything other than basic first aid treatment. Some snakes use venom from front or rear fangs as part of prey capture and defense. This venom is not always produced or administered  by the snake in ways dangerous to human health, so many species are venomous in that they produce venom, but considered harmless to humans in most cases because the venom is of low potency, and/or otherwise administered through grooved rear teeth or simply oozed from ducts at the rear of the mouth. Species like Ringneck Snakes *Diadophis* are a good example of mildly venomous rear fanged dipsadine snakes that are traditionally considered harmless or not medically significant. Many rear-fanged snake species are harmless as long as they do not have a chance to secrete a medically significant amount of venom into a bite; [severe envenomation can occur](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23800999) if some species are [allowed to chew on a human](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S004101011831016X) for as little as 30-60 seconds. It is best not to fear snakes, but use common sense and do not let any animals chew on exposed parts of your body. Similarly, but without specialized rear fangs, gartersnakes *Thamnophis* ooze low pressure venom from the rear of their mouth that helps in prey handling, and are also [considered harmless](https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/05/theres-no-need-to-fear-that-garter-snake/). Even large species such as *Malayopython reticulatus* [rarely obtain a size large enough to endanger humans](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/108/52/E1470.full.pdf) so are usually categorized as harmless.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n*I am a bot created for /r/whatsthissnake, /r/snakes and /r/herpetology to help with snake identification and natural history education.

Next would be Cleveland to take my dad to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and yet another really cool used game store that sells games for nickels at a time. Then Niagara Falls for obvious reasons (hoping for a really good sunset picture and a poem), and then 2 days in Toronto. While we were planning this, my dad got super psyched over all the Atlas Obscura type stuff there. so we'll be staying longer. Finally, a long drive back to Detroit, passing through London, Canada. I'd love to do this with him as my parents recently got a divorce and I love my dad so so much. Tbh, my memory deteriorates a lot faster than most people, so I don't IF I'd remember much, but in the moment it would mean a lot.",
