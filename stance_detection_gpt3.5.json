My only comment is that I understand most of that soluble nitrogen gets washed away from usable farmland, into water bodies as a pollutant often triggering things like Lake Erie toxic algea blooms. Eventually this dies and falls to the bottom layers and is effectively no longer contributing to the cycle  or carrying capacity.\n\nPhosphorous is similar in that human waste and sanitation dumps the resource in a similar way. There was research on extracting key nutrients for reuse, but I don't think its been commercialized.\n\nThe \"easy\" solution of composting biological waste to be repurposed as fertilizer and keeping it as usable terrestrial sources has consequences of magnifying feedback loops of unwanted contaminants like pharmaceuticals, hormone disruptors, heavy metals, and now PFAS and microplastics.

Fish flies aka mayflies from the order Ephemeroptera (pretty sure genus is Hexagenia for these swarms) live in the lake bottom (aka benthos) as nymphs for up to 2 years before emerging as the winged adults that you see on land. They burrow in the soft sediments and are and indicator of good water quality. They feed on detritus, or decomposing bits that fall to the lake bottom. In some parts of the Great Lakes, these mayfly swarms don\u2019t happen anymore due to pollution and human altered habitat. The emerging adults provide abundant food for fish. If they make out of the water, they\u2019ll mate, lay eggs on the water, then die. \n\nA lot of other common summer insects have similar life cycles - dragonflies and damselflies spend most of their life cycle as aquatic nymphs as well.

        "MRpolo13 is correct, old iron furnaces and steel mills needed power (from water) and they still needs lots of water itself, but there is also more to it.  Raw material production of most kinds produces a lot of waste, and production of metal from ore is the same.  In *modern* steelmaking, about 1/2 of slag is produced for every 1 ton of iron.  Modern industry tries to find a beneficial and moneymaking reuse for these materials, and modern slag is used for making cement, glass fibers, agricultural soil treatments, aggregate, and other things.  Most of it gets reused today.  But the ratio of slag to steel production was higher back then, and the reuse was limited.  High supply, low demand...an iron furnace could soon be drowning in its own slag if it were not dumped or dispersed far away from the mill.  Most larger towns had a mill of some kind, outside of town, and slag would be dumped around the mill for as long as possible.  It was also given away just to get rid of it, and was hauled away and used road and railroad base, it was used to fill in low areas for construction and development, it was just dumped down riverbanks and into stream beds and the ocean, and to make dikes and levees, and it was used as landfill to fill in ocean bays and the bays in the Great Lakes.  In 1969, Bethlehem Steel received permits from the US and local govt's to dump 1.5 MILLION TONS of slag per year into Lake Erie at their facility in Lackawanna NY.  A lot of that is still there, and there is a whole valley filled with it in Bethlehem, PA.  So - there was a lot of it produced, it got spread all over the place, and it is inorganic and doesn't degrade.  So we still have it scattered around.  Sorry if TLDR.",

How is that not a significant improvement?\n\nAnd regarding money: the site is within the Nokomis-Hiawatha Regional park and as such will qualify for regional park and water quality dollars from the Met Council and possibly the state.

The original timber Casino was built in \r\n1925, and destroyed by fire in 1932. The present day stone \r\nCasino was completed in 1938 by nearly 50 employees of \r\nthe WPA. The use of stone in the construction of the park \r\nduring the days of the WPA provided its structures with a \r\nrustic feel. The flagstone area behind the building allows \r\npark users to gaze upon marvelous views out towards \r\nBuffalo and even far out beyond Lake Erie to Canada. \r\nThe design of bridges and cabins blended into the \r\nnatural beauty of the park and 3.5 miles of roads were \r\nconstructed to allow access to the natural areas of the \r\npark.

        "THE BLADE/KURT STEISS\nBuy This Image\n\nVoters got a chance to hear directly from the two candidates for Ohio House District 41 as Democrat Nancy Larson and Republican Josh Williams faced off Wednesday in a debate that highlighted far more differences than similarities.\n\nThe debate, hosted by WTVG-TV, Channel 13 and The Blade at the station\u2019s studio, saw the candidates address hot-button topics such as crime and abortion, as well as their plans for finding solutions to local-level issues. They include protecting Lake Erie and how to spend the state\u2019s pool of American Rescue Act funding.\n\nMs. Larson, a social worker from Sylvania, said that she feels the outcome of the election will determine \u201cwhether we have more or less freedom when it's over.\u201d She added that the work she has done through 40 years in the field has allowed her to help \u201cthousands\u201d of people during her career.\n\nMr. Williams, a criminal defense attorney and Oregon resident, said in his opening statement that he wants to \u201cmake it easier for every single motivated Ohioan to dig themselves out of the circumstances and grow to their true potential.\u201d\n\nHe described his own story of going from a high school dropout and being disabled from a work accident to becoming a college graduate and a practicing attorney.\n\nThe 41st House District was put in place as a part of the state\u2019s recent redistricting process. It stretches from Richfield Township to Jerusalem Township, encompassing Sylvania, Oregon, and parts of North Toledo, including Point Place, along the way.\n\nWhitmer High School is not in the candidates\u2019 district, but part of Washington Local School District is in the district. Both candidates addressed how they want to lower crime in the community in the wake of Friday\u2019s shooting outside a football game at Whitmer. Three people were wounded. \n\nMs. Larson argued for more \u201csensible\u201d gun laws and a focus on funding for afterschool programs and community policing.\n\nMr. Williams said that the solution lies within ensuring that the state \u201cproperly funds the police\u201d and considering stricter penalties for violent offenders. They include a \u201c10-year minimum\u201d gun specification \u201cfor the use of guns in violent crimes.\u201d\n\nOn the issue of police reform, both candidates agreed that qualified immunity should be removed. Qualified immunity is when officers are \u201cimmune from civil liability when they act outside the bounds of their authority,\u201d Mr. Williams said.\n\nWhen the topic of abortion was addressed, the candidates differed greatly. Ms. Larson said that she wants to return to the abortion protections that were allowed by Roe vs. Wade.\n\nMr. Williams argued that the GOP-backed \u201cheartbeat bill\u201d would still allow for abortions for up to six weeks. He added that he would support abortion exceptions for pregnancies that threaten the life of the mother.\n\nOhio has to find a way to spend more than $5 billion in American Rescue Plan Act funding for continued recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. Both candidates hope to find a way to maximize northwest Ohio\u2019s share of that fund, if elected.\n\nMr. Williams said that he wants to see the money go toward \u201cjob creation and workforce development,\u201d and an expansion of job training programs. Ms. Larson wants to see more funding for the University of Toledo, establishing a community college in downtown Toledo, and investing further in clean energy development.\n\nDuring the hour-long debate, the pair also sparred over how to best protect one of the region's most important natural resources in Lake Erie. Both have differences in what they believe is the root cause of what pollutes the lake.\n\nMs. Larson said that the state needs to stop permitting \u201cconcentrated animal farms\u201d and look into disbanding existing farms that dump waste into Lake Erie.\n\n\u201cThe land can handle so much waste, and it needs to be farmed appropriately,\u201d she said.\n\nMr. Williams believes that the problem lies within municipalities not being held accountable for dumping their wastewater into the lake.\n\n\u201cThe solution is not to ban pigs,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cIt's about how we hold cities accountable for the untreated sewage their dumping into our rivers and lakes.\u201d\n\nIn closing statements, Ms. Larson said that she believes that she is \u201con the side of democracy\u201d in her positions.\n\n\u201cSometimes leaders do what they know is the right thing to do, even if others don\u2019t yet see it,\u201d she said. \u201cMost of the time though, leaders can and should listen to the will of the people because it's a reliable guide to what will turn out best for all of us. I have the work experience, the wisdom, and the empathy to do this job in that way.\u201d\n\nMr. Williams believes that his personal experience makes him a candidate who can bring about unique solutions for the district and the state.\n\n\u201cThe solution is not just to have empathy for everyone because of their life experiences,\u201d he said in his closing statement. \u201cIt\u2019s using your life experience to help guide Ohioans to a better future.\u201d\n\nEarly voting for the general election started Wednesday. Election Day is Nov. 8.",

The time of night and the bright lights of the stadium attracted the midges to the playing field.\n\nEdit: I just grabbed my copy of the book\n\nVerducci writes that midges had disappeared from the polluted Lake Erie, but after extensive clean up efforts there and in the Cuyahoga River, they began to return.  Midges only really swarm a few days a year in early May - June, but October 5th 2007 was unusually warm in Cleveland, so that triggered another swarm.  They gathered around the artificial light of the stadium, and descended on the playing field.  The play time of the game was adjusted to accommodate the Red Sox/Angels game, and that ended up putting the 8th inning of Game 2 right smack in the middle of the swarm.\n\nSo yeah, environmental cleanup, an 81-degree night in October, and some schedule shuffling landed the Yankees in the middle of a swarm of bugs.",

        "# Leftist perspective\n\nLeftists want our economy to explicitly serve the people in our society and to be deliberately engineered to improve people's outcomes and freedoms.\n\nVoting Republican will destroy the fragile web of regulations that prevent things from getting much worse fast. For just one example, the EPA was created after unrestrained capitalism regularly set fire to major rivers and Lake Erie. [Trump tried to gut it.](https://theweek.com/articles/816875/how-trump-redefining-epa)\n\nLeftists generally want everyone to have a baseline guaranteed quality of life. Republicans since Reagan [have worked to remove or limit welfare programs.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1984/07/29/reagan-welfare-cuts-found-to-worsen-families-poverty/077278f9-a875-4791-9c34-d1cf3cd148b5/) Welfare programs are no more than gauze on an arterial bleed, but they're better than nothing.\n\nDemocrats, however, are often in favor of maintaining, or occasionally improving, these inadequate bandage policies. Voting Democrat is a matter of harm reduction. It's nowhere near all that leftists want to do, but if voting doesn't require obscene amounts of effort, it's pretty effective at slowing the rate of going-to-hell.\n\nHowever, Democrats cannot be trusted to enact a leftist agenda, or even make a token gesture toward leftism.\n\n# Liberal perspective\n\nEconomically, a liberal is someone who supports capitalism. Socially, a liberal is someone who supports people doing what they want with their lives.\n\nFrom the economic perspective, you might vote Democrat because the businesses you support aren't negatively impacted by current and likely future regulations, at least not more than they're helped. Those who take a broader view of the economy would generally agree that, for instance, forbidding people from dumping used motor oil into the Ohio River is a bit of a burden on those who need to dump used motor oil, but it's more than offset by having the Ohio River not catch fire every year.\n\nYou might also vote Democrat because you think a few people temporarily need assistance when they're down on their luck, but most everyone can and should participate in capitalism, and that should be the goal of assistance programs.\n\nYou could also vote Democrat because, while you prefer further right economic policies, you are against bigotry and think the government has a place in protecting against it, like with affirmative action \u2014 or at least that it should abstain from enforcing it, such as with transgender healthcare bans. Or because you believe that people should not be forced to give up their health due to pregnancy and should be able to obtain an abortion.\n\nYou might also vote Democrat because the only other viable alternative is a Republican and that Republican is a child rapist or the like. This has happened in some elections. Democrats are generally quick to remove or disavow politicians who have been credibly accused of serious misconduct, but Republicans seem unmoved by such accusations.\n\n# Right-wing perspective\n\nTechnically, this is the *further* right wing perspective economically.\n\nYou might vote Republican because you view taxes and government programs as an imposition on your freedom. Government, you say, should exist for a minimal set of purposes, and it's taken on a large set of other responsibilities that should instead exist as different kinds of entity. This is an economically libertarian view.\n\nYou might also vote Republican because of bigotry. Republicans want to dismantle affirmative action and marriage equality. They support religious organizations being used for things like adoption and supporting homeless people, even when these religious organizations discriminate against people on the basis of religion or sexuality or the like. They have been legislating against transgender rights such as getting gender-affirming healthcare. They're keen on enacting laws to ban single digit numbers of trans children from participating in middle and high school sports. They use openly racist rhetoric, like strongly implying that Mexican immigrants are rapists and murderers.\n\nOr you might like the strong man rhetoric that Republicans use.",

        "This is from ohiodnr website:\n\nNUISANCE SPECIES: MUTE SWANS\n\nMute swans are commonly seen on large public lakes and are widespread throughout Ohio. They are considered a non-native invasive species in the United States and are becoming a nuisance here in Ohio. There are three species of swans that can be found in Ohio: The native trumpeter swan, tundra swan (or whistling swan, which only migrates through Ohio) and the mute swan. Mute swans will outcompete with the threatened trumpeter swan on Lake Erie marshes and other locations for nesting habitat.\n\nDuring the breeding and nesting season, which generally runs March through May, adult mute swans become highly territorial and will fight to push native birds out of their nesting area. Mute swans have been known to attack humans and pets during this time as well. This aggressive behavior also occurs after the young, called cygnets, hatch out. On public lakes, people who use jet-skis and kayaks tend to get flogged by swans if they get too close to their nest or young. The adult male will fly after what they see as a predator to chase it away and use their wings to attack. They have been known to drown people on rare occasions.   \n\nAn adult male swan can weigh up to twenty-six pounds and stand as tall as five feet. Mute swans can consume up to eight pounds of submerged aquatic vegetation in one day. They uproot the whole plant usually leaving nothing behind. This takes away natural habitat from fish and leaves little food source for native waterfowl. The removal of aquatic vegetation can also cause water quality issues and erosion problems. \n\nThe Division of Wildlife controls mute swans on public lands by utilizing egg addling to cut back on production and by physical removal of adult birds. Occasionally, complaints are received from homeowners who surround public lakes when mute swans are being aggressive. Removal of the bird is the action taken when human safety is a factor.  \n\nContrary to what most people believe, mute swans will nest next to Canada geese. Homeowner associations or golf courses will purchase swans for goose control. Ultimately the swans will eventually become a problem for the homeowners around the ponds because of aggression issues and removal is warranted. We encourage private landowners who chose to have mute swans to keep them controlled. The ways to control them is to only purchase one swan or two of the same sex and keep their wings clipped or pinioned. This will keep the swan on the owner\u2019s property. Landowners can also addle the eggs so cygnets do not hatch out. If the young are going to be allowed to hatch out, their wings need to be clipped or pinioned as well so they cannot leave the property. Division staff will assist private landowners who ask for removal of mutes by giving technical assistance or removing the swans depending on site-specific circumstances.",

We\u2019ve released the most balloons in the world at one time and basically told the environment a big fuck you and also resulted in at least one death I can remember but it might\u2019ve been more. Nobody wants to swim in Lake Erie and I\u2019ve been told you can\u2019t eat the fish caught in it. Buuuuut that\u2019s all I can think of for now as to why I hate that fucking place. When I got old enough I joined the army just to get out of Ohio. I grew up poor in pretty much the poorest county in Ohio so I feel like I get to state the true feeling of this I hate Ohio craze. They\u2019re not wrong, Ohio sucks. Unfortunately Ohio could be pretty fucking cool, had it not been completely ruined by corrupt politics over the last 140 yrs or so. And the state has gerryfucked the district so much the people that do nothing to even help will remain in power and it will get worse. But that\u2019s just my perspective I reckon.",

Recent\ndata show a pathogen impairment throughout the watershed, as well.\n\n&gt;In 2004, the Regional Water Board adopted a Sediment TMDL Implementation Policy\n(Resolution Rl-2004-0087), which states that Regional Water Board staff shall\ncontrol sediment pollution by using existing permitting and enforcement tools.  The\ngoals of the Policy are to control sediment waste discharges to impaired water bodies\nso that the TMDLs are met, sediment water quality objectives are attained, and\nbeneficial uses are no longer impaired by sediment.\n\n&gt; Sediment\nconditions interact with water in many ways that can affect water temperatures.\nTherefore, practices implemented to prevent and minimize elevated sediment\ndischarges may also help control elevated water temperatures.\n\n&gt;potential discharges of treated wastewater\n\n&gt;During the PHI, RWB staff observed a road fill failure and associated debris slide. The\nfailure occurred on a permanent road constructed on an ~85% slope above a Class III\nwatercourse, extending about seven feet into the old road prism and narrowing the road\nto less than seven feet in width. The failure is approximately 75 feet wide, 40 feet long\nand 4 to 8 feet deep (Fig 1.) Sediment and debris from the failure entered the Class III\nwatercourse at the foot of the slope,\n\n&gt; All of these sites and other sites throughout the plan area were littered with\ntrash, some of which may contain toxic substances. RWB staff observed one small (~5\ngallon) tank of refrigerant and numerous camping gas tanks. Several of these sites were\nsituated in the channels of Class II and III watercourses.\n\n&gt;There are two potential issues of concern with respect to\nthe irrigation lines; one is the potential for impacts to slope stability by removal of trees\non saturated vulnerable ground and the other is impacts to the districts disposal process\nif a line is damaged.\n\n&gt;During the first review process, CDFW brought to attention discrepancies in Section II, Item 32(a) of the\nTHP regarding northern spotted owl protections. The habitat definitions and retention standards\ndescribed appeared to be from Attachment B instead of Attachment A, which contains the take\navoidance measures for northern spotted owls in the coast forest district. In the RPF response to first\nreview, the definitions and retention standards were not corrected, and Attachment B was referenced\nnear the beginning of Item 32 within the northern spotted owl protections.\nCDFW recommends in Section II, Item 32(a), the protection measures for NSO be revised to reflect the\ndefinitions and retention standards for Attachment A, the November 1,2019 revision. Justification: The\ntake avoidance measures should reference the appropriate ecotype, allowing the review team to\nevaluate the proposed measures for NSO take avoidance.\n\n&gt;During the first review process and through a Northern Spotted Owl (NSO) consultation, CDFW brought\nto attention concerns with the timing and stations of the NSO surveys that may affect the quality of the\nsurvey data, resulting in a possible false negative finding. The RPF agreed to supplement the survey effort with three additional surveys in 2020 conducted as close as possible to the crepuscular hours and\none additional thorough Stand Search of the THP area. Efforts to obtain NSO survey information from\npast THPs on the property were ongoing at the time of the PHI, and the RPF was able to provide eight\nyears of NSO survey data from a neighboring NTMP during first review.

It can't. In a global economy, individual consumers have no power to force changes on companies through their purchasing decisions.\n\nThe reason regulations exist is because it's simply not possible with the limited time that we all have to keep companies honest, and to expect that the honest ones are going to have any sort of advantage in a marketplace that is too overflowing with information and misinformation for the consumer to make informed decisions on every good they purchase.\n\nUltimately, whether or not I shop at Amazon makes zero difference towards the company's bottom line. Everybody else knows the same thing, and so in the aggregate there's no way to change them. We know this, because the fact that individuals will act in their own self-interest is a foundational principle of free market economics.\n\nRegulations allow both businesses and consumers to make better ethnical choices. Again, we know this is true based on generations of empirical evidence - just look at Lake Erie, and the impact that EPA regulations had on it even within a 20-year time span starting in the '70s.\n\nWe don't breathe smog-filled air because of pollution controls. The hole in the ozone layer is gone because of CFC regulations. Kids aren't eating leaded paint chips or breathing leaded gasoline fumes, because of lead regulations. Vehicle fatalities have dropped tremendously since the 1970s because of vehicle safety regulations.\n\nThe idea that the market freedoms allow for the best possible results for society is nothing more than pure brainwashing propaganda by pro-business forces. Does it make for a slightly more efficient economy? Perhaps. But that's not worth the health, safety, and happiness trade-offs that come with it.",

Exposed agricultural and urban lands, particularly in southwest Ontario and northwest Ohio, contribute immense sediment loads to the lake.\n\nIn particular, one of the worst sources of the phosphorus that feeds the toxic algae is the [Maumee river watershed](https://news.umich.edu/lake-erie-phosphorus-reduction-targets-challenging-but-achievable/).\n\n&gt;The main driver of the harmful algal blooms is elevated phosphorus from watersheds draining to Lake Erie\u2019s western basin, particularly from the heavily agricultural Maumee River watershed.

        "I'm sorry, but you are either incredibly naive or ignorant on the subject. \n\nIf you are interested in the situation here are some snippets for this article: https://www.greatlakesnow.org/2020/09/drinking-unsafe-water-contaminants-solutions/ \n\n\"Seth Siegel, author of Troubled Water: What\u2019s Wrong With What We Drink, underscores the evolution over time in contamination concerns, from the biological to the chemical. \u201cA dab of chlorine might address microorganisms, but it does nothing about these synthetics,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are ingesting, in micro quantities, a cocktail of chemicals all the time.\u201d\n\n\nThe Clean Water Act, in theory, regulates discharges into U.S. waters and therefore protects sources of drinking water. However, this year the Trump administration issued a new regulation, the Navigable Waters Protection Rule, that narrows the scope of the Clean Water Act by revoking federal protections for millions of miles of streams and millions of acres of wetlands. The NRDC and other environmental groups have filed a lawsuit to stop the decision.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t have a strong Clean Water Act, we\u2019ll never have clean drinking water,\u201d says Lynn Thorp, national campaigns director for the nonprofit Clean Water Action. \u201cWe need to put equal effort upstream.\u201d\n\n\n\nOutdated standards\nEven when the law is enforced, advocates lament that the standards used are often outdated. The current federal drinking water standard for nitrate, for example, went into effect in 1992 at 10 parts per million. Yet research has found that levels less than one-tenth of that legal limit may raise the risk of cancer and other health issues. In early 2019, the EPA suspended plans to reevaluate the nitrate standard.\n\nThe EPA did propose an update in October 2019 to its rules on lead and copper, which had not been touched since 1991. Meanwhile, the House of Representatives approved new legislation this past July that authorizes US$22.5 billion to replace a portion of the country\u2019s estimated 6 to 10 million lead service lines that remain, connecting water mains to homes in Flint, Newark and elsewhere. Kail says that AWWA supports the revision. \u201cAs long as there is lead in contact with the water, some level of risk remains,\u201d he says. \u201cSo the best cure is to get the lead out.\u201d\n\nAdvocates argue the rules still won\u2019t go far enough or come fast enough. And they suggest the same generally holds for the EPA\u2019s actions or inactions on drinking water quality. Of most concern, they say, are the potentially hazardous contaminants that still lack a standard. \u201cThe law really is broken and needs to be fixed if it is going to protect the public,\u201d says Olson.\n\nThe EPA\u2019s current process for developing new standards, defined in the 1996 amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act, needs to be sped up and strengthened, he and other advocates say. The EPA\u2019s Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule (UCMR) allows the EPA to select up to 30 unregulated pathogens and pollutants to be monitored every five years. Public drinking water systems serving at least 10,000 people, along with a representative sample of smaller systems, must periodically test for these contaminants. The agency uses the data in considering future drinking water standards.\n\nSo far, the only new chemical that the agency has come close to regulating through the process is perchlorate, a component of rocket fuel, munitions and fireworks. Studies suggest that exposure may derail brain development of fetuses and infants. The EPA determined in 2011 that the contaminant required regulation. But this June, the agency reversed course and announced that, taking into consideration \u201cthe best available science and the proactive steps that EPA, states and public water systems have taken to reduce perchlorate levels,\u201d it would not regulate perchlorate. That decision is now in litigation. \u201cThe EPA just hasn\u2019t had the spine to issue any regulations off the contaminant candidate list,\u201d says Olson.\n\nSix perfluorinated chemicals were monitored via the UCMR between 2013 and 2015. This past February, the EPA announced preliminary regulatory determinations and opened up comments for two of those chemicals, PFOA and PFOS. Meanwhile, several states, including New Jersey and New Hampshire, have moved ahead with their own regulations, some of which go beyond PFOA and PFOS \u2014 the legacy PFAS compounds that are already being phased out \u2014 to include more of the potentially thousands of extremely persistent synthetic chemicals that belong to the same class.\n\n\nPathogens and pesticides\nPathogens remain a serious issue, too. E. coli in drinking water has caused deadly outbreaks. Norovirus, Giardia and cryptosporidium have also contaminated drinking water supplies in recent years. But the pathogens perhaps highest on the minds of experts today are those that grow in pipes.\n\nLegionella, the bacterium that causes Legionnaires\u2019 disease, a type of pneumonia, offers a critical case in point. It poses a microbiological threat with widespread consequences. In Flint, the same issue that caused the release of lead into the drinking water also resulted in deadly cases of Legionnaires\u2019 disease in the surrounding community. Repeated outbreaks at a Quincy, Illinois, veterans home have killed more than a dozen people since 2015. And, in May 2019, a custodian died from Legionnaires\u2019 disease after being infected at Kettering Fairmont High School in Kettering, Ohio. The school\u2019s water tested positive for Legionella this July, and a current custodian has tested positive for the disease. Spokespeople with the Illinois veterans home and the Ohio high school note that measures have been taken to reduce the risk of further infections.\n\nAgricultural practices remain implicated in much of the nation\u2019s tainted drinking water. Studies have shown that pesticides pose a serious threat. For example, atrazine has been associated with low birth weight in babies.\n\n\u201cEvery spring in the Midwest, a pulse of atrazine comes off the fields. Tough luck on you if you happen to be carrying a child during that period,\u201d says Sedlak, noting that regulatory standards might still be met because EPA regulations average numbers over the course of an entire year.\n\nNeonicotinoids are another example. \u201cNeonics are wonderful [from a human health perspective] because they target receptors specific to insects,\u201d Sedlak says. \u201cBut, after a chemical reaction with chlorine, the product is something that is likely to target people.\u201d Limited data hints at potential health effects ranging from respiratory, cardiovascular and neurological issues to birth defects.\n\nExcess fertilizer applications on farms also trigger major algal blooms that can contaminate drinking water. Toxins produced by blue-green algae (also known as cyanobacteria) in Lake Erie fed by runoff from farms in the watershed contaminated the Toledo, Ohio, drinking water system in the summer of 2014. Almost half a million people were told to avoid drinking, bathing or cooking with their tap water for a couple of days; 110 people got sick. It was neither the first nor the last time that such toxins threatened public health. Residents of Carroll Township, Ohio, received a similar warning in September 2013. And in July 2018, authorities in Salem, Oregon, advised children and the elderly not to drink the city\u2019s water.",

        "I\u2019m from Michigan and I\u2019ll write a short list of why we hate Ohio: \n1. The fertilizer runoff from their never-ending swaths of farmland flows into Lake Erie and causes massive toxic algal blooms. \n2. Those same never-ending farmlands become mind-numbing any time you have to drive through the state. It takes approximately five hours to go straight through north \u2014&gt; south, but it feels like days because it\u2019s so *boring*. Oh, and you thought you were almost there? Just kidding, here\u2019s some never-ending unnecessary construction that\u2019ll send you on a half hour detour and get you all kinds of turned around, just to add to the misery.\n3. Speaking of driving through, we\u2019re notorious for speeding in MI: if the speed limit says 70 mph, you better be doing at least 78 or your ass is gonna get tailgated. But Ohio? Don\u2019t even THINK about it. As soon as you cross the border, there is ALWAYS a cop waiting to catch people going 2-3 mph over. Best keep it at a cool 65, lest you face the wrath of the boys in blue. And 65mph for *five fucking hours* makes the drive feel even *longer*. \n4. More driving stuff: be prepared to spend up to $15-20 USD as you drive because Ohio has TOLLS. We Michiganders don\u2019t believe in the concept. And yes, our roads suck. But we\u2019re proud of them anyways because we already pay for them with our hard-earned tax dollars, dammit! Never mind having to pay EXTRA for roads you\u2019ve already paid for! Also, is there really any good way to make sure that your check engine light still works other than clobbering a good ol\u2019 Michigan pothole? \n5. Ohio State University vs Michigan State University and/or University of Michigan. Never has a greater rivalry festered, and never has there been one more bitter. Wear a Buckeyes jersey in our state at your own risk. \n6. Ohio would love to be as innovative and world-changing as Michigan. Yeah, sure, whatever, a whole bunch of astronauts and pilots were born there. Y\u2019know how those guys got to NASA or their flight schools? By driving in CARS. Y\u2019know where the most automobiles came from soon after they were invented? Michigan, and more specifically, Detroit. The moon is cool and all I guess, but cars permanently changed the entire world. \n7. The Toledo War: before Michigan was a state, Ohio had the audacity to try and lay claim to a section of the Michigan Territory. After a bitter (but bloodless) dispute, Ohio got the Toledo Strip. We\u2019ve never forgotten it. Now, we did end up getting the better deal because we wound up with the Upper Peninsula i.e. thousands of acres of beautiful forest, copper and iron mines that boosted our early economy, and access to Lake Superior. But still. The absolute *unmitigated gall*.\n8. Ohio thinks they have bragging rights because seven US presidents were from there. But y\u2019know what? They were all *the most forgettable* presidents ever. Names like Warren G Harding and James Garfield. But did they do anything noteworthy or memorable? Who the fuck knows what they did?? Not me. *Except for Ulysses S Grant- he helped end the Civil War. Dude was \u2018aight. \n9. They\u2019ve passed some headass backwards laws recently concerning women\u2019s rights, gay rights, etc. Conservative as fuck with zero qualms about being rude to your face. At least in the South they\u2019re nice about it and throw a \u201cbless your heart\u201d in there with their ass-backwards thinking. \n10. Ohio\u2019s state flag is the only state flag that isn\u2019t a rectangle. Why? For what? Do they think they\u2019re fuckin\u2019 special or something??\n\nIn conclusion, from a proud \u2018n\u2019 Pure Michigander, fuck Ohio.",

It was the first advisory for any of the Great Lakes warning of fish with elevated levels of PFAS.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;PFAS are known as \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because they don\u2019t break down in the environment. After years of industrial use, the federal government recently took steps to regulate them. **But will it be enough to assure the safety of the Indigenous people who have fished on the lake for thousands of years \u2014 and depend on the fish for survival?**\n\nPFAS forever chemicals affect EVERYONE!  Most NDNs in my tribe, including myself, regularly go fishing &amp; depend on fish for food from our rivers &amp; lakes.  Friday Fish Frys are a cherished tradition in Wisconsin, among Natives &amp; Non-Natives alike.\n\nThis news article is distressing to me; I'm sorry this is happening.  When I was younger, after we got back our Rez lands, I felt like we could close ourselves off (from an environmental perspective) from the dominant society destructive ways then we'd be okay.  This was around the time when Lake Erie had caught on fire.  I thought if we followed our traditional ways, then that was what mattered &amp; we'd survive.\n\nThen came Acid Rain.  I realized dominant society's pollution rained on us, too.  We could be doing the right thing, but we're indirectly affected by others.  We're all in this together.  We need to work together to stop destroying our planet!  I still have hope.",

        "In the territory that once was the Empire of Atu'apol lies a planet by the name of Ska'i 2. It was once a huge industrial hub for Atu'apol, with countless factories and chemical refineries run by a population of 500 million.\n\nSo naturally, Ska'i 2 would make the perfect target in a war, and that's what happened.\n\nThe Great Atu'apol War came, and Ska'i 2 was designated a high value target once the Kor-Vosh Empire and the ATU went on the offensive. Kor-Vosh forces attacked the planet with thousands of nuclear weapons and neutron bombs. Nothing was to survive the assault, by order of the High Command of the Imperial Armada.\n\nIndeed, nothing did survive. No buildings were left intact, all 500 million Atu'apol citizens were killed, and what was left behind was a nuclear and chemical wasteland.\n\nToday, radiation levels are still too high on Ska'i 2 for anyone to visit, outside of professionals in maximum-protection hazmat suits. Chemicals from the refineries are still concentrated to dangerous levels in many spots on the planet's surface, coming in the form of contaminated water and soil. These concentrations prevent flora from growing in large swaths of Ska'i 2's surface, though areas with lower concentrations show sporadic plant growth. The rain is frequently acidic or otherwise laced with various toxins, forcing the surviving flora to evolve natural defenses. Fauna is almost nonexistent, with the largest animals still alive being no larger than a rat.\n\nThe planet's atmosphere has also been altered by the release of toxic chemicals. Aerosols are trapping more heat than the planet could handle, causing any large bodies of water to evaporate. However, aerosol concentrations are slowly dropping, and the planet's average temperatures along with them, so some bodies of water are making a comeback.\n\nIf you were to look at Ska'i 2 from low orbit, you would see its surface as a patchwork of mostly grays and browns, but with splotches of green and blue where plants and water have emerged. Remains of cities and other infrastructure is also visible from space, which look like differences in the surface's texture, and is accompanied by the craters and scorch marks from the nuclear blasts.\n\nShould you be brave enough to land on Ska'i 2 with a hazmat suit, there isn't a lot to look at besides the city ruins. Every single building is at least partially collapsed, and you would probably see a haze. That haze is not smoke or smog, but clouds of chemicals evaporating from the soil, so DO NOT TAKE OFF YOUR HELMET! Outside of the ruins, you would find a whole lot of barren rock and soil, with plant remains strewn about. The bodies of water come in the form of rivers and lakes, with the largest lake being the size of Lake Erie. Surrounding the lakes and rivers are the remaining flora, mostly grasses and hardy bushes. Don't expect to see any animals - the animal population is very low and they spend most of their days in burrows.\n\nScientists estimate that it would take 25,000 years for the radiation and chemical concentrations to dissipate enough to be considered safe for people to walk on the planet's surface without a protective suit or breathing apparatus.",

        "In the novel, due to environmental pollutants, industrial waste, AIDS, nuclear plant accidents, pesticides, and the spread of disease, there was a lot of infertility. The reasons were discussed in detail in the Afterword written in the future, and also during the novel Aunt Lydia gives us a contemporary perspective. Basically, the causes of infertility were a laundry list of things people were concerned about in the 1970s and early 1980s. Like nowadays we talk a lot about global warming but back then there was a lot more concern about environmental pollution since there hadn't been an EPA until 10 years before the book was written and environmental pollution ran rampant and was quite visibly bad, with multiple scandals, deaths, and visibly bad air. Lake Erie caught on fire. And AIDS had only been around for a few years and no one knew where it was headed but we were sure it would get worse and spread more into the general community, and at the time Atwood wrote the novel there were no treatments and it was a death sentence within a few years for almost everybody. Also the first IVF baby was in 1978 in the UK and 1981 in the US so when she wrote the book in 1984 it was still the dawn of the really amazing fertility treatments we have now and we had not yet seen its impact so treatments for infertility were more limited. Likewise surrogate motherhood didn't formally start until the year after this came out. So in the novel, some infertility was of women, some was of men, but since Gilead didn't recognize male infertility, only women got blamed or examined. There was an implication that the commanders were older, so their couples were affected by the infertility starting during their fertile years but by the time of the novel, many had aged out of their fertile years. So like the women might have been fertile when younger but the men were not but since that wasn't acknowledged, the fertile women ended up being unimpregnatable (impregnable? unimpregnable?). Others of the women had been fertile but were now too old. \n\nSo basically in the book there might be couples with biological kids and also couples with handmaid-made kids, but due to the nature of the book, they focus only on the handmaid families. TV shows tend to simplify, so they didn't bother showing us the families with bio kids. Though it's implied that even if you have bio kids, you can still get a handmaid as a perk.\n\nAs for the fertile women: if a woman is fertile and also does not fall afoul of the new rules of Gilead (such as having had an abortion, gotten divorced, committed adultery, married a man who was divorced, lived with a man out of wedlock, evidence of an affair with a married man, having had a job that was offensive to them in some way, etc.), then such a woman would be a Wife (wife of someone of the upper class) or Econowife (a wife for someone of the lower class). If she had fallen afoul of their rules but was fertile, then she might be executed, sterilized and made into a prostitute, or made into a handmaid. If she was infertile and unmarried, then she might be a Martha if religious, or declared an unwoman and sent to the colonies. Or if young and attractive and thin but sterile, she might be sent to Jezebels to be a prostitute.\n\nBut the number of fertile women had overall gone down due to disease and pollution.",

        "The small fish aren't the ones breeding.  Take enough big females (in most fish, the females are larger) out of a system and you start getting declining numbers of fish.  It's an easy concept\n\nYou can easily find 100s of fish populations in both fresh and salt water which have been damaged, heavily reduced, or gone extinct due to over harvest. The Atlantic Cod stock off Canada for example.  Bluefin tuna.  Orange roughy.  Swordfish.  Yellow perch in Lake Erie, and the now extinct blue pike.  \n\nThere's nothing wrong at all with responsible harvest of fish.  I keep a few each year myself and enjoy fish dinner.  The problem is the attitude of \"I keep everything that's legal.\"  A fat female fish full of eggs should be released.  A rare but important fish in an ecosystem, like a muskie, should be released.  Fish that's just going to end up getting freezer burned because you've already got tons in the freezer?  Yeah, let them go.  Around here we call those people \"pigs.\" \n\n  Being greedy and keeping everything just damages the resource for others.  Why would you release a fish for someone else to catch it? So they can enjoy that fish, too.  Fish populations and the rivers, lakes, streams and oceans they inhabit are constantly on the brink and if you enjoy eating the fish you catch and enjoy fishing, you need to do your part by being responsible with your harvest and preserving it for others to enjoy, too.  It's simple to understand.\n\nCatch and release is what most fisherman these days practice and it's helped preserve fish populations all over the world.  If done properly, the vast majority of fish survive with very little damage and go on to grow and breed.",

        "Back in the 80s, Lake Erie began to have a problem with the expansion of an invasive species called a Zebra Mussel. They would coat the surface of everything, even threatening to clog the water intake that provided drining water to Cleveland. They had been brought in the bilgewater of foreign cargo ships. \n\nAuthorities were stumped as to how to get rid of them, and even had a competition with a substantial prize for anyone that could find a solution to get rid of the Zebra Mussels. It turned out, all they had to do was wait.\n\nLake Erie's water was notoriously murky, full of organic material that made the underwater view very poor. The Zebra Mussels loved that organic material, and it contributed to their spread. As they multiplied, and ingested more and more of the organic matter, sunlight began to penetrate the water for the first time in decades. It turned out that Zebra Mussels didn't like the sunlight, and began to die off. Eventually, they reached an equilibrium between the amount of sunlight and the amount of organic food material and they are no longer considered the big threat they once were. \n\nThe new, clearer waters also spawned a new popularity in wreck diving. Because it is the shallowest of the Great Lakes, storms have always quickly turned dangerous on Lake Erie, and there are more wrecks on the floor of Lake Erie than any other, stretching back to the 17th century. With the higher visibility, it is much easier to explore these shallow water wrecks.\n\nSomehow, nature always finds a way.",

My youngest son (30) and his daughter (4) have been living with me about 3 yrs.  It's been nice.  I only have a 2 bedroom trailer but it's in a lovely place. My front door opens to a view of lake Erie, we have a beach and a pool.  There's only about 20 of us who live here full time, the rest are ppl who own homes and come to their trailers during the summers.  Everyone loves my grandaughter and it's a very safe place to live.  They don't allow trouble makers in here.\nAbout 6 months ago my oldest son asked if he (34) and his gf (23) could move in.  They had nowhere to go, and both my kids inherited my 3 autoimmune diseases which makes it very difficult to hold employment.\nMy younger son is doing everything he should be.  He has a case manager, has applied for disability ( he's had a job since 16yrs old), he receives counseling and sees his dr.s Once a month.\nI told my son he and his gf needed to do the same things.  I didn't realize what I was in for.  They fight non stop.  She's been to the physch ward 3 times, but never follows up with aftercare.  I'm all for giving ppl with mental illness a chance, but not when they refuse the help they've been handed.  I also don't want my grandaughter raised in an abusive environment, and I'm afraid if she keeps screaming well get kicked out.   I told my son his gf had to go.  He called me an asshole for kicking a poor helpless person out.\nSo Am I being an asshole?  Or am I doing right by putting my grandaughters needs 1st?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

        "This is a very naive take. First, the actual enforcement of disease checks is severely lacking in most states\n\nSecond, many states barely regulate bait suppliers at all. Sure, they have licenses and permits, and occasional inspections. But there's a lot of shady stuff that happens even in the above-board providers. By accident or intention.\n\n Hell, in some states it is legal to use goldfish as bait, and they can be horribly invasive\n\nAnglers should NEVER release store-bought bait into the water. \n\nIn most cases the bait won't survive, but there's plenty of invasive populations that get started from bait releases. \n\nHere's a great example:\n\n&gt;Bait and pond stores comprise potential, yet poorly understood, vectors for aquatic invasive species (AIS). We tested for AIS and illegal native species in 51 bait and 21 pond stores from the central Great Lakes (Lake Erie, Ohio and Lake St. Clair, Michigan) and the adjacent Wabash River (Indiana) using environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcode assays of water samples and morphological identifications. Retailers were questioned about supply chains, and anglers surveyed about baitfish use and disposal. Assays revealed unadvertised species eDNA in 100% of bait stores, with 61% containing illegal native non-bait (totaling 13 species) and 88% having AIS (11 species). Illegal native non-bait species included juvenile walleye, yellow perch, and white sucker eDNA. AIS eDNA included Eurasian ruffe in seven stores (all states), silver carp in five (including a Lake Erie store in two separate years), and bighead carp in two Lake Erie stores that also had silver carp. Among pond stores, two in Lake St. Clair had bighead carp eDNA, one also contained silver carp, and a Wabash River location showed European ide. Unadvertised invasive snails were discerned in 55% of pond stores. Four contained zebra mussel eDNA and two had invasive bryozoans. Illegal native species and AIS were widespread, but showed little relationship to the retailers' variable and extensive supply chains. Live baitfish releases were reported by 50% of Lake Erie anglers and 35% in Lake St. Clair. Consumer behavior and AIS prevalence in the bait and pond trades thus pose serious risks for introductions and spread.\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320719314508",

        "How about the decline of Emerald shinners and rainbow smelt. I am a third generation lake Erie fisherman and have witnessed a lot of changes over 50 years. One was the invasive round Goby. It was back in the 90s I was swimming in about six foot of water where I noticed strange little fish on the bottom in which I had never seen before. I reported this sighting to the local Sr aquatic biologist. A couple years later it came out about the round Goby. At that time there was a lot of speculation like the Goby is going to poison the local fish. That never happened as it turned out the round Goby was a favorite treat for many species of fish. One of the effects was the lakes population of yellow Perch was at a severe decline. The perch ended up making a rebound due to feeding on Goby. As I mentioned before there is a major decline of Emerald shinners and rainbow smelt in lake Erie. The lack of Emerald shinners might have been the reason why we seen that decline. Emerald shinners are one of the yellow Perch favorite forage bait fish. Can we call the the minnows Lady? Lol being a over the edge hard core fisherman that's a compliment. Are you single lol\nIt's interesting to hear from someone with a obsession for fish as myself. I was 18 years old 50s now and talked with the local aquatic biologist about the lake the fish and the bite. I participated in a diary program for steelhead brown trout fishing.",

        "Biologist? \n\nNo but I attended a lecture on the ecology of climate change and discussing the increasing pr\u00e9venance of Cyanobacteria blooms was a big part of it.\n\nThe limiting factors of blooms are different for salt water and freshwater (one is phosphates, one is nitrates).\n\nAgain I didn\u2019t disagree that salt/rock salt has been linked to blooms, but there\u2019s well established precedent that fertilizer runoff contributes to blooms.\n\nThe record setting bloom in Lake Erie back in 2011 wasn\u2019t from road salt, it was [from fertilizer](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1216006110):\n\n&gt; In 2011, Lake Erie experienced the largest harmful algal bloom in its recorded history, with a peak intensity over three times greater than any previously observed bloom. Here we show that **long-term trends in agricultural practices are consistent with increasing phosphorus loading** to the western basin of the lake, and that these trends, coupled with meteorological conditions in spring 2011, produced record-breaking nutrient loads. An extended period of weak lake circulation then led to abnormally long residence times that incubated the bloom, and warm and quiescent conditions after bloom onset allowed algae to remain near the top of the water column and prevented flushing of nutrients from the system. \n\nHere\u2019s a link from NOAA discussing the link between [Urea based fertilizer and Blue-Green Algae blooms](https://coastalscience.noaa.gov/news/urea-based-fertilizer-promotes-blue-green-algal-blooms-in-sarasota-bay-florida/) choking the gulf coast.\n\nBut don\u2019t take it from me, I\u2019m not a biologist.",

        "A$69 million environmental cleanup of the former Bethlehem Steel site in Lackawanna is poised to begin next year, clearing the way for the public to gain access to that portion of the Lake Erie waterfront for the first time in more than a century.\n\nState officials on Wednesday announced that they have finalized remediation plans for the 489 acres of contaminated land nearest to the shoreline of the lake.\n\nThose plans build on efforts that have already been underway for some time. Those efforts were unveiled in May and subject to public comments that were addressed in documents that detail the steps that will be taken and why that remedy was selected.\n\nThe aim is to restore the property and natural habitat in a way that protects human health and the environment, while advancing the state Department of Environmental Conservation's goals of preserving and connecting the site's natural resources, state officials said.\n\n\"My family worked at the Bethlehem Steel plant and I know firsthand what cleaning up the former site in Lackawanna means for the people who live here,\" said Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Lackawanna native. \"Today marks a critical milestone in the rebirth of this city and this project is the perfect example of how New York State is rebuilding communities by putting former industrial sites like Bethlehem Steel to good use.\"\n\nOnce a dominant force in Lackawanna, Bethlehem Steel had used more than 1,600 acres for iron and steel production during its heyday, but left the site contaminated with arsenic and other metals, along with semi-volatile organic carbon compounds related to the use of rail transportation, oils, greases and fossil fuels, according to the state.\n\nThe remediation plans were required as part of a 2020 consent order about the cleanup between the DEC, Tecumseh Redevelopment and Tecumseh's former parent company, Arcelor Mittal USA, which assumed environmental responsibility after Bethlehem Steel's 2001 bankruptcy.\n\nVarious parts of the site will be handled under the state Superfund program, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Corrective Action Program and Brownfield Cleanup Program.\n\n\"The cleanup and redevelopment of the former Bethlehem Steel site will be transformative for the City of Lackawanna and all of Western New York,\" said DEC Commissioner Basil Seggos. \"This rebirth, advancing under DEC oversight to ensure it is protective of public health and the environment, will yield benefits for the entire community.\"\n\nThe construction and cleanup work is expected to take seven years to complete. Details of the plans are available online.",

Rescuers spotted their 16-foot (4.9 m) boat anchored west of the Edgewater Park breakwall. A Coast Guard search and rescue helicopter crew had difficulties reaching the area because of the \"asteroid field\" of balloons. A search-and-rescue boat crew tried to spot the fishermen floating in the lake, but Guard officials said balloons in the water made it impossible to see whether anyone was in the lake. On September 29, the Coast Guard suspended its search.

        "Most polluted areas are government owned, air and waters. This means that the government, as the owner, allowed the pollution.\n\n&gt; But government ownership is not true ownership, because the government officials, while able to control the resource cannot themselves reap their capital value on the market. Government officials cannot sell the rivers or sell stock in them. Hence, they have no economic incentive to preserve the purity and value of the rivers. Rivers are, then, in the economic sense, \"unowned\"; therefore government officials have permitted their corruption and pollution. Anyone has been able to dump polluting garbage and wastes in the waters. But consider what would happen if private firms were able to own the rivers and the lakes. If a private firm owned Lake Erie, for example, then anyone dumping garbage in the lake would be promptly sued in the courts for their aggression against private property and would be forced by the courts to pay damages and to cease and desist from any further aggression. Thus, only private property rights will insure an end to pollution \u2014 invasion of resources. Only because the rivers are unowned is there no owner to rise up and defend his precious resource from attack. If, in contrast, anyone should dump garbage or pollutants into a lake which is privately owned (as are many smaller lakes), he would not be permitted to do so for very long \u2014 the owner would come roaring to its defense.1 Professor Dolan writes:\n\n&gt; &gt;With a General Motors owning the Mississippi River, you can be sure that stiff effluent charges would be assessed on industries and municipalities along its banks, and that the water would be kept clean enough to maximize revenues from leases granted to firms seeking rights to drinking water, recreation, and commercial fishing.2\n\nLearn more here:\n\nhttps://mises.org/library/libertarian-manifesto-pollution\n\nhttps://mises.org/library/law-property-rights-and-air-pollution",

        "You can find Dubna, a small town three hours away from Moscow by train, both on a map and in the periodic table: dubnium, element number 105, was discovered at a research center there, and named after the town. A hasteless town, Dubna is defined as much by the surrounding forests as by the water: it sits on the banks of the Ivankovskoe Reservoir, the first part of a massive hydropower project called \u201cBig Volga\u201d whose construction spanned decades during the Soviet era. The complex, consisting of 11 dams on the Volga and its largest tributary, the Kama, is responsible for about 5% of the total electricity production in Russia. The Ivankovskoe Reservoir is both the oldest part of the complex and the farthest upstream, situated almost at the Volga\u2019s headwaters.\n\nAbout 2,300 miles long, the Volga\u2014sometimes referred to as \u201cVolga-matushka,\u201d or \u201cMother Volga\u201d\u2014is the longest river in Europe and the biggest by water flow, arcing from northwest of Moscow around and down to the Caspian Sea. Some 60 million people\u2014about 40% of Russia\u2019s population\u2014live in its basin, which spans almost a tenth of the country\u2019s vast territory. Moscow, with its 12 million people, gets most of its drinking water from the Volga via the Moscow Canal. About 1,500 miles downstream, the strategic port city of Volgograd, formerly known as Stalingrad, was the site of World War II\u2019s most decisive, and arguably bloodiest, battle. As an artery of commerce, a source of energy and drinking water, and a conveyor of history, the Volga touches nearly every aspect of life in Russia. It is what the Mississippi is to the United States or the Rhein to Germany.\n\nWhen the station in Dubna was designed, in the early 1930s, the young Soviet state had just decided to catch up with the capitalist states of the West by rapidly accelerating its industrial development\u2014but in order to do so, it needed to generate energy on a massive scale. By the time the last station was built, in the 1980s, the Soviet Union, having just hosted the Olympics for the first time, was about to launch perestroika, a program of large-scale democratic reforms intended to end an era of stagnation and revitalize the flailing state. The history of the Big Volga project is, in a sense, the history of Soviet industrialization. It is also a history of rivalry with the US, which for decades raced the Soviets to build bigger, more impressive dams.\n\nThe project was one of the largest nature-transforming schemes in history: put together, the artificial reservoirs on the Volga are about as big as Lake Erie. It tried to harness the river to provide the Russian people with necessary things: energy, transportation, and water. But it tried to do too much.\n\nThe river has become polluted, silted up, and overwhelmed by invasive species. Water flows at a tenth of the speed it did before the dams were constructed, according to estimates by researchers at the Institute of Ecology of the Volga River Basin, in the central Russian port city of Togliatti. Widespread toxic algal blooms are now common.\n\nAs global temperatures rise, the Volga basin is getting less and less rainfall in the spring and summer, and more snow in the winter. Igor Mokhov, chief scientist at the Obukhov Institute of Atmospheric Physics of the Russian Academy of Sciences, points out that the intensity of spring and summer precipitation is expected to increase, making post-high-water planning more difficult. A team of Russian hydrologists, writing in an August 2021 paper in Ecohydrology &amp; Hydrobiology, argued that because of climate change, \u201cthere will be more water in those regions \\[of Russia\\] where it is sufficient, and less where it is most needed.\u201d The Volga basin is one of the regions most at risk, they wrote.\n\nIt is not an exaggeration to say that Russia\u2019s mother river is broken.\n\nI visited Dubna on a windy November morning. Runners in colorful clothing zipped by people walking their dogs along an unkempt reservoir front. I found myself in a grayscale photo of milky clouds and water like quicksilver, interrupted by the odd patch of evergreen and autumn brown. The opposite side of the reservoir was an impenetrable wall of coniferous trees, shrouded in a light mist.\n\nI was trying, in vain, to orient myself to figure out how exactly one of the better-known stories about this reservoir must have unfolded. The story goes that in late November 1941, German forces were closing in on Moscow and had planned to cross the frozen body of water. The hydropower station workers reportedly decided to drain the reservoir, dropping water levels abruptly by two meters, crushing the ice and buying the city some time by stopping the invaders in their tracks. Eighty years later, though it was the same time of year, there was no ice in sight.\n\nThe hydropower station itself is a restricted site, encircled with an abundance of barbed wire, warning signs, and towering cranes so enormous there are small buildings on top of them. The noise of the water was pierced by seagulls and the occasional car as I walked along the dam. It was Unity Day, a modern Russian holiday devised to supersede a Communist holiday celebrating the 1917 revolution. Some of these people were driving to the Vladimir Lenin statue, a spot beloved by locals.\n\nI could see Lenin\u2019s back at the end of the road. The statue was surrounded by ceremonial blue-green fir trees, and looked across the water at nothing in particular. The corresponding monument to Joseph Stalin had been demolished in 1962, after the Soviet government decided to \u201cde-Stalinize\u201d itself. The two monuments, each almost 40 meters tall, once guarded the entry point to the Moscow Canal, a Soviet engineering marvel connecting the Volga and Moskva rivers.\n\nBeside the complex, there is a memorial hardly taller than I am. It looks like a random granite building block, tilted to the side, seemingly thrown out by the mighty waters to the foot of the Lenin monument and behind its back. The stone was placed there in 2013 to commemorate the more than 22,000 prisoners who died building the canal. Flowers and wreaths at the bottom were still fresh from the annual ceremony, held on October 30, when Russians remember those persecuted and murdered by the state, usually by reading their names aloud in front of countless similar memorials across the nation.\n\nA young boy in a yellow jacket asked his mother, who was putting their things into the car parked near the memorial, \u201cMom, what\u2019s written on the stone?\u201d\n\nTo the builders of the canal, she responded without looking.\n\nThis only made him ask her another question: \u201cWhy builders? Isn\u2019t the Volga a real river?\u201d\n\nIn a way it isn\u2019t really a river anymore\u2014it no longer flows naturally. It is now so mediated by human intervention that it is better thought of as a machine.\n\nJust two months after the first gulag prisoners had arrived at the future dam site in Dubna, in November 1933, research bigwigs at the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union gathered in Moscow to discuss the state of the Volga and the Caspian Sea. Evgeny Burdin, a historian in the Volga town of Ulyanovsk, some 900 miles downstream from Dubna, read to me from one of the reports presented at the meeting. The report predicted that reservoirs would cause \u201cswamp formation due to flooding, poor conditions for soil self-restoration, flooding of cellars in homes, changing microclimate, algae blooms and stale water, pollution, slowing down of water flow, and local risks of malaria.\u201d\n\nThe river has become polluted, silted up, and overwhelmed by invasive species. Widespread toxic algal blooms are now common.\n\n\u201cEven if there wasn\u2019t deep public awareness and discussion, surely many of the hydrologists and engineers knew that there would be significant and unavoidable impacts \u2026 Many people were aware of it, but it was very difficult, I\u2019m sure, to say anything,\u201d Paul R. Josephson, a professor of Russian and Soviet history at Colby College, told me.",

The fire, which witnesses reported reached as high as 5 stories, began at 12 P.M. and lasted about 20 minutes before it was brought under control. A fireboat battled the blaze on the water while units from 3 fire battalions brought the flames on the railroad trestles under control. The bridge belonging to the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Co. sustained $45,000 in damage, forcing the company to close it to rail traffic. The other trestle, belonging to the\u00a0[NEWBURGH &amp; SOUTH SHORE RAILROAD CO.](https://case.edu/ech/articles/n/newburgh-south-shore-railway/), incurred damages estimated at $5,000 but remained open. The blaze apparently was caused by an accumulation of oily wastes and debris on the river under 2 wooden trestles at the foot of Campbell Rd. hill, SE, in Cleveland. According to a subsequent investigation by Cleveland's Bureau of Industrial Wastes, the fire probably came from a discharge of highly volatile petroleum derivatives with a sufficiently low flash point to be ignited by a chance occurrence at the site of the railroad bridges.\nCleveland's reputation was severely damaged by the fire because at the time there was national concern about the pollution of Lake Erie and the rivers and streams that fed into it\u2014particularly the Cuyahoga River, which was among the most polluted in the country. Ironically, another oil slick burned on the Cuyahoga River in 1952 causing an estimated $1.5 million damage without attracting national attention.\n\nhttps://case.edu/ech/articles/c/cuyahoga-river-fire\n\nThis was one of the major leading factors that forced Republican POTUS Nixon to create the EPA.",

        "I\u2019m gonna give rebuttals using the number scheme op used. Also, it\u2019s worth mentioning I am an environmental scientist, so this is my educated opinion here. \n\n1.) Solar panels can be placed a lot of places in a lot of ways. You can stagger them so there\u2019s a row of panels and a row of prairie. This actually makes the panels more effective as well since the plants help keep them cool through transpiration. At the very least, they\u2019re less ugly than a coal power plant. They also won\u2019t slowly give you cancer.\n\n2.) So are the panels going in a forest or crop land?? I would agree that they shouldn\u2019t put the panels on what would have been forest, but that\u2019s very unlikely to happen anyway with how much deforested fallow land sits idly by. Farms are not part of the environment. Period. There are very few things that are more unnatural than huge monocultures of nonnative, domesticated plants. Farms actually cause a lot of pollution in Ohio. I can elaborate on this if you like, but it\u2019s also very easily investigated. Look into the Lake Erie harmful algal bloom. Ohio farmers also are often paid to over farm or not farm at all. The US has had massive surpluses of both corn and soy since the 70\u2019s. We clearly do not need to produce this much and can loose a little farm land. \n\n3.) Fighting climate change and local pollution is so incredibly much more expensive than the tax will be to build a solar facility. Plus, coal and gas have huge hidden fees that the tax payers cover as well. We fund the EPA and OEPA. If they have to spend millions if not more to fix superfund after superfund caused by fossil fuels, then that bill will be floated by us. \n\n4.) How much tourism? Good God, are people really that repulsed by blue, gray panels? Also, y\u2019all think these panels are just going to be causally next to your downtown, lake, or river?? No, they\u2019re gonna be in the middle of a field. \n\n5.) Once again, I really don\u2019t think this ones that big of an issue either. I did a quick search and could only find evidence that it would increase your property values. Either way, I genuinely would let my house price depreciate by a few thousand if it means fewer fossil fuels.\n\n6.) This is the most valid of the arguments, by far. I will give y\u2019all that. It is hard if not near impossible *currently* to recycle panels that have reached the end of their life, but it is still by far more efficient and less polluting to go solar over fossil fuels. Considering [researchers estimated that exposure to particulate matter from fossil fuel emissions accounted for 18 percent of total global deaths in 2018 (which is 8 million people, a little less than 1 out of 5)](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/news/2021/02/deaths-fossil-fuel-emissions-higher-previously-thought) I\u2019d say that solar is still by far a winner. Panels are getting more sophisticated, less expensive, more effective, and more recyclable every year. Their recyclability is so much of an easier problem to fix than the carnage fossil fuels creates every day. \n\nI\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m being aggressive. Protecting the environment is literally job and a moral obligation of mine. It\u2019s so sad to see people fall the blatant misinformation. A lot of politicians, at every level, are paid off by the fossil fuel industry. They play dirty and want to do things that they know will hurt us all. It is in your best personal health interests as well as all of our best interests about the climate to help end our utter dependence on fossil fuels. These politicians and corporations are using anyone who will listen to them. They\u2019ve been doing it since the beginning.",

Last year we had a Brown Booby near Akron after one of the hurricanes (I do think this one was displaced by one). Last year we had a Snowy Owl come down at the beginning of November, and while they aren't totally rare to see here, seeing them in November is crazy early. The past few years we have had a few Painted Buntings up here during spring migration. There was a Northern Wheatear in the northern Ohio area early this year as well, and if you don't know what those are, they are absolutely not native to this area. We had Piping Plovers nest up here for the first time in 80 years.\n\n\nSomething is definitely going on to cause us to see birds like this more frequently. We have had a massive comeback in Bald Eagle population here and we are on a major flyway for migration, so birds are never on short supply here. It doesn't explain what is going on with sightings like the Spoonbill though. I wonder if there will be studies done regarding the movement of these birds.",

This brought up water with very low oxygen levels from the deeper part of the lake to the surface. Coupled with a constant wind and storms over the weekend, this has caused a number of issues including sizable fish-kills, algal die-off, increased amounts of manganese in the raw water, strong odor, and high turbidity (cloudiness) in the raw lake water. This water is very difficult to treat and has affected nearly all water treatment facilities on Lake Erie, especially those in the central basin.\n\nFirst, we would like to take this opportunity to assure you that the treated water supplied to the area municipalities continues to meet the stringent water quality standards established by Ontario Regulation. The water system\u2019s contracted operating authority, the Ontario Clean Water Agency, has been working diligently to ensure the treated water quality continues meet the drinking water standards; however, some consumers may notice a change in the appearance and taste of the water as a result.\n\nTo address the low oxygen levels and higher manganese content, the water treatment plant has made some temporary operational changes to address the current circumstances. These include an increase in chlorine levels to compensate for the higher-than-normal chlorine demand and ensure adequate disinfection prior to the supply of water to area municipalities, as well as increased the use of powder activated carbon to combat the strong taste/odors associated with the event.\n\nThe supply of water from the Elgin Area Water System to the City of London has been temporarily discontinued to allow the water treatment facility to address these very challenging raw water conditions at lower flow rates.\n\nOur counterparts along the north shore of Lake Erie continue to struggle with these conditions, many in much worse circumstances that what we\u2019re experiencing. The lake conditions have slowly but continually improved somewhat from the initial onset of the event late last week, but it will likely be well into the week before we return to more normal conditions.\n\nOur treatment plant operations staff have been keeping our counterparts in the various municipal water operations advised throughout this event and will continue to do so until the issue has returned to more normal conditions.\n\nConsumers are encouraged to contact your local municipality should you experience any issues with the drinking water supplied to your residence or business.\n\nOh I see they have an additional statement \nBy mid-week, conditions on Lake Erie continue to improve and raw water quality has started to return to more-normal conditions. While dissolved oxygen levels in the raw water continue to improve, they remain at below-normal levels. \n\nThe treated water from the Elgin Area water treatment plant has significantly improved, with pH returning to normal conditions. The plant continues to dose higher rates of powder activated carbon to mitigate issues with taste and odour. \n\nThe supply of drinking water to the City of London from the Elgin Area Water System was restarted earlier this week, but at lower daily volumes than normal. The City of London continues to be primarily supplied from the Lake Huron Water Supply System as normal.\n\nQuestions or concerns from consumers about the supply of drinking water from their municipal water distribution system should contact their local municipality.",

        "Not saying this as an attack on you: I think \"I feel very disconnected with these generic answers\" is a *huge* part of the problem with addressing climate change and other environmental issues in this country. My background is in geoscience; I can't help but see Earth as one interconnected system. I often forget that's not true for everyone.\n\nSo let me try again.\n\n**TL;DR**: The source of your water is less of a problem than what happens when you're done with it. The less used water that flows forth from your lawn, the fewer serious problems downstream.\n\nWithout knowing exactly where you are, I can't dig in to find out the details of your watershed, so this is necessarily going to come across as a bit vague and/or generic.\n\nI see two major ways in which watering your (presumed) monoculture lawn is problematic: one close to home and one much farther away.\n\nWatering from your local Great Lake isn't ideal--far better to plant a variety of native things which can thrive in your climate zone without extra irrigation--but the real problem is what comes off your lawn. A monoculture grass lawn can't absorb much of a major rain or snowmelt event, particularly if the water table is already high. What it can't use becomes stormwater runoff, which carries pollutants from your lawn and any pavement it touches into storm drains. The storm drains, in turn, feed the local waterways, which feed the Lakes and the rivers. \n\nI don't know which of the Lakes you're on, but [here's](https://www.ijc.org/en/green-without-envy-great-lakes-drown-excessive-nutrient-pollution) a bit about nutrient--that is, fertilizer--pollution in Lake Erie which gives a bit of insight into why that's problematic: fish die-offs, potential freshwater supply disruption, and potential vectors of disease for humans and birds.\n\nThe farther from home part depends on your watershed situation. IF there's a river that your watershed feeds, odds are that that river flows into the Mississippi, which flows into the Gulf of Mexico. The runoff from your lawn (hypothetically) contributes to runoff from other lawns and agricultural operations all the way downstream to the Gulf, where it contributes to a nutrient pollution issue which negatively impacts the Gulf's ecosystem and the people who make their living from it.\n\nThe reason it's best to keep as much rainwater as we can where it falls is that it minimizes such problematic runoff.",

I was born mid 1980's - growing up, any outdoor water recreation was pools, manmade lakes, and natural lakes used for drinking water. The areas river systems and Lake Erie were still just fucked. \n\nI forget when it changed from \"it's not safe to eat fish from Lake Erie\" to like \"You can eat like 2 fish from Lake Erie a month without consuming dangerous amounts of mercury\"... but yeah - that was totally a thing, and not that long ago.\n\nHonestly at one point I think everything everywhere in this area was just one giant steel mill - hell - one of the Cuyahoga River's (many) fires served as a rallying cry for increasing social interest in environmentalism that led to the creation of the EPA.\n\nEPA superfund sites are the first example of cleanup done well I'd like to toss out there - in the interest of brevity - [their list of completed projects is cool](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-success-stories). \n\nAs to the river systems in this area - the transformation just in my lifetime is hard to believe - wasn't just the Cuyahoga that caught fire - river fires were common all over the place. Mahoning River burned a number of times... In my childhood like our parents would say don't swim in them - but even as kids &amp; kids do dumb shit was unnecessary, many still looked, just awful - I mean they were dead in many places still. Today?most all are safe/clean/thriving and used for recreation now.\n\nThe ingredients for successful cleanup are simple - both the superfund sites &amp; the smaller efforts to clean up area waterways that have been shockingly effective  follow basically the same pattern.\n\nBring the polluter, environmentalist to serve to keep polluter honest, some level of government to serve as the enforcement mechanism &amp; possible partial source of funding, and the situationally appropriate scientists - who take baseline samples to establish problem, a system to monitor the problem, and what the target goals for these are the numbers needed for the biome to recover to the point it's functional again, and what the numbers need to be for the effort to be considered complete &amp; successful. \n\nDon't leave the table till there's a plan for how to extract pollutants, a plan for how it's being paid for. A plan for how monitoring will work and penalties for non compliance. One those are agreed upon it just takes time \n\nIn my lifetime I've watched that turn dead, disgusting, dangerous rivers polluted beyond comprehension for 100+ years of industry that treated them like trashcan in my 35ish years of paying attention to them. Which - pretty wild if you think about it - most of that time was spent getting things to the point where the ecosystem could return to minimal functionality - once that happened the pace of cleanup increased exponentially, nature is really good at cleaning up after us when not totally fucking broken.",

        "&gt;All right: Even if we concede that full private property in resources and the free market will conserve and create resources, and do it far better than government regulation, what of the problem of pollution? Wouldn't we be suffering aggravated pollution from unchecked \"capitalist greed\"?  \nThere is, first of all, this stark empirical fact: Government ownership, even socialism, has proved to be no solution to the problem of pollution. Even the most starry-eyed proponents of government planning concede that the poisoning of Lake Baikal in the Soviet Union is a monument to heedless industrial pollution of a valuable natural resource. But there is far more to the problem than that. Note, for example, the two crucial areas in which pollution has become an important problem: the air and the waterways, particularly the rivers. But these are precisely two of the vital areas in society in which private property has not been permitted to function.  \nFirst, the rivers. The rivers, and the oceans too, are generally owned by the government; private property, certainly complete private property, has not been permitted in the water. In essence, then, government owns the rivers. But government ownership is not true ownership, because the government officials, while able to control the resource cannot themselves reap their capital value on the market. Government officials cannot sell the rivers or sell stock in them. Hence, they have no economic incentive to preserve the purity and value of the rivers. Rivers are, then, in the economic sense, \"unowned\"; therefore government officials have permitted their corruption and pollution. Anyone has been able to dump polluting garbage and wastes in the waters. But consider what would happen if private firms were able to own the rivers and the lakes. If a private firm owned Lake Erie, for example, then anyone dumping garbage in the lake would be promptly sued in the courts for their aggression against private property and would be forced by the courts to pay damages and to cease and desist from any further aggression. Thus, only private property rights will insure an end to pollution \u2014 invasion of resources. Only because the rivers are unowned is there no owner to rise up and defend his precious resource from attack. If, in contrast, anyone should dump garbage or pollutants into a lake which is privately owned (as are many smaller lakes), he would not be permitted to do so for very long \u2014 the owner would come roaring to its defense.\n\n\\- Murray Rothbard",

        "This is the Cuyahoga running into Lake Erie. The Cuyahoga caught fire in 1969 (for the 13th time), a disaster that had a hand in the creation of the EPA. \n\n&gt; Cleveland, OH was once known as a major industrial center within the United States.  As the 1960s came to an end, so did the country's reliance on industrialized manufacturing.  However, Cleveland continued production which when paired with a lack in sewer and waste disposal regulation maintained the littering of the Cuyahoga River.  On June 22, 1969, around 12pm, floating pieces of oil slicked debris were ignited on the river by sparks caused by a passing train.  Specifically, following an investigation, the cause was determined to be the oily debris trapped beneath two wooden trestles, rigid support frames, located around the Campbell Rd. hill in Southeast Cleveland.  The fire was determined to have reached heights of over five stories and lasted between twenty and thirty minutes.  There was reported to be around $50,000 of damages including: $45,000 from the destruction of the bridge owned by Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Co. and $5,000 from the Newburgh &amp; South Shore Railway trestle. \n\n&gt; The Cuyahoga River was once one of the most polluted rivers in the United States as represented by the multitude of times it has caught fire, a recorded number of thirteen starting in 1868.  The most potent blaze occurred in 1952 which caused over $1.3 million in damages however, the most fatal fire happened in 1912 with a documented five deaths.  The 1969 fire, which did not incur maximum damages or fatally wound any citizen, was the most covered incident occuring on the river.  This was in part because of the developing precedence that sanitation held over industrial actions; the United States was becoming more eco-aware.  Also, due to the shift from industry to technology, waste dumping to recycling Time Magazine produced an article about the incident.  This brought mass amount of attention to the Cleveland area and added pressure for hygienic regulation.\n\n&gt; Inspired by the 1969 river fire, Congress was determined to resolve the issue of land pollution, not just in Cleveland, but throughout the United States.  The legislature passed the National Environment Policy Act (NEPA) which was signed into law on January 1, 1970.  This act helped establish the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) which would be given the duties to manage environmental risks and regulate various sanitary-specific policies.  One of the first legislations that the EPA put-forth was the Clean Water Act (1972), which mandated that all rivers throughout the United States be hygienic enough to safely allow mass amounts of swimmers and fish within the water by 1983.  Since the 1969 Cuyahoga River fire the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District has invested over $3.5 billion towards the purification of the river and the development of new sewer systems.  There is a projection that over the next thirty years the city of Cleveland will further endow over $5 billion to the upkeep of the wastewater system.  The river is now home to about sixty different species of fish, there has not been another river fire since 1969, and yearly new waste management programs develop to ensure the sanitation of Cleveland's waterways.   \n\n[From Ohio History Central](http://ohiohistorycentral.org/w/Cuyahoga_River_Fire)",

The threat is really to the integrity of the ecosystem and to the species that inhabit it. \n\nThe potential threat to humans occurs after oxygen is depleted. At that point, the chemistry changes and anoxic chemical reactions occur that often release nutrients like phosphorus from lake sediments. That fuels algal blooms, and, when nutrients are high enough and other conditions are correct, harmful algal blooms. These harmful algal blooms are toxic to humans and wildlife. \n\nAs an example, Lake Erie regularly goes anoxic (zero oxygen) in its deep waters each summer. The lake also gets some pretty serious harmful algal blooms.

So there can be a human health impact, but it is not from low oxygen in the water. It is from the knock-on effects that occur after oxygen is depleted. \n\nHow to deal with that? Well, folks in Toledo had to drink bottled water for a few days.",

        "Steht in dem Paper, aber hier nochmal zitiert:\n\n&gt; The threat to avian wildlife from nuclear power plants can be divided into upstream and downstream fatalities.\n\n&gt; Upstream, uranium milling and mining can poison and kill hundreds of birds per facility per year. Abandoned open pit uranium mines in Wyoming have formed lakes hazardous to wildlife. Uranium-bearing formations are usually associated with strata containing high concentrations of selenium. For example, one of these pits killed 300 birds during a single year (US Fish and Wildlife Service 2008). Presuming this rate stayed constant, deaths at this mine therefore correlate to about 0.45 deaths per GWh.\n\n&gt; Like fossil-fueled power stations and wind farms, avian fauna can also collide with nuclear power plants. Three thousand birds died in two successive nights in 1982 from collisions with cooling towers at Florida Power Corporation's Crystal River Generating Facility (Maehr et al. 1983). Given that the power plant now hosts an 838-MW nuclear reactor, and presuming it operated with a capacity factor of 90% and that the 3000 deaths were the only ones throughout the year, the facility was responsible for 0.454 avian deaths per GWh. Ornithologists observed 274 fatal bird collisions with an elevated cooling tower at the Limerick nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania from 1979 to 1980 (Veltri and Klem 2005). Since the Limerick plant has a 1200-MW reactor, and also assuming it operated at a 90% capacity factor, it was responsible for 0.261 deaths per GWh. At the Susquehanna plant in eastern Pennsylvania, 1500 dead birds were collected between 1978 and 1986 for an average of 187 fatalities per year (Biewald 2005). Assuming that the 2200 MW plant operated at 90% capacity factor, it was responsible for 0.01 deaths per GWh. Extensive surveys for dead birds were also conducted at the Davis-Bess nuclear plant near Lake Erie in Northern Ohio. Ornithologists recorded a total of 1554 bird fatalities or an average of 196 per year from 1972 to 1979 (Biewald 2005). Given that the power plant hosts an 873-MW reactor, and assuming it operated with a 90% capacity factor, and the plant was responsible for 0.0285 fatalities per GWh. Taking the mean for each of the four power plants results in 0.188 deaths per GWh.\n\n&gt; The total avian deaths per GWh for nuclear power plants are therefore about 0.638.",

        "[Archive.is link for paywall](https://archive.is/Aujjl#selection-388.0-586.3)\n\n&gt; The Biden administration is set to toss out President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to scale back the number of streams, marshes and other wetlands that fall under federal protection, kicking off a legal and regulatory scuffle over the fate of wetlands and waterways around the country, from the arid West to the swampy South.\n\n&gt; Michael Regan, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, said his team determined that the Trump administration\u2019s rollback is \u201cleading to significant environmental degradation.\u201d The EPA and Army Corps of Engineers will now craft a new set of protections for waterways that provide habitats for wildlife and safe drinking water for millions of Americans, according to a joint statement.\n\n&gt; With the announcement, the Biden administration is wading into a decades-long battle over how far federal officials can go to stop contaminants from entering small streams and other wetlands.\n\n&gt; \u201cCommunities deserve to have our nation\u2019s waters protected,\u201d said Jaime A. Pinkham, acting assistant secretary of the Army for civil works.\n\n&gt; In 2015, the Obama administration expanded federal authority to stop or curtail development that could harm a variety of wetlands, streams and ditches that feed into larger bodies of water protected under the Clean Water Act.\n\n&gt; Heeding the call of home developers, oil drillers and growers who saw the restrictions as detrimental to their livelihoods, the Trump administration rolled back those Obama-era pollution controls.\n\n&gt; But critics, including a panel of independent scientists picked by the Trump administration itself, slammed the move for potentially hastening the destruction of waterways, including \u201cephemeral\u201d streams that appear only after rainfall and help purify water on its way to larger lakes and rivers that serve as sources of drinking water for millions of Americans. The current lack of protections is particularly notable in dry states such as New Mexico and Arizona, the EPA said.\n\n&gt; \u201cThe science says those streams and these wetlands are an important part of our clean-water system in the United States and should be protected,\u201d said Tom Kiernan, head of American Rivers, a conservation group.\n\n&gt; Now, Regan says he\u2019s trying to strike the delicate balance between conservation and development that both the Trump and Obama administrations failed to reach.\n\n&gt; \u201cWe\u2019ve learned lessons from both, we\u2019ve seen complexities in both, and we\u2019ve determined both rules did not necessarily listen to the will of the people,\u201d Regan told House lawmakers in April.\n\n&gt; The Biden administration\u2019s rulemaking could help stem the staggering loss of wetlands.\n\n&gt; Since the end of the Revolutionary War, more than half of the 221 million acres of wetlands in what would become the contiguous United States have been drained, often for farming. The rate of destruction began to wane only in recent decades.\n\n&gt; In northwest Ohio, for instance, corn and other crops are grown on a vast tract once known as the Great Black Swamp. Farmers began draining it during the 19th century, and now agricultural runoff flows into Lake Erie and feeds the growth of toxic algae that regularly closes beaches and once forced the city of Toledo to suspend tap water use for about two days.\n\n&gt; Bill Stanley, state director of the Nature Conservancy in Ohio, said the Trump administration\u2019s withdrawal of federal protections for what few streams remain to filter nutrient waste from fertilizers could make the lake susceptible to even bigger algae blooms.\n\n&gt; \u201c \u2018Nutrients\u2019 doesn\u2019t sound like a bad word,\u201d he said, \u201cbut when you get too many of them, it causes major problems for our water quality in Ohio.\u201d\n\n&gt; But farmers such as Daryl Lies, who raises hogs and sheep and grows vegetables on 160 acres in central North Dakota, say the Obama-era restrictions on wetland development would have been \u201cpainstakingly costly for agriculture.\u201d Those rules, he said, \u201cwould have made it a lot harder to have the livestock\u201d near a creek that winds along his farm on its way to the Missouri River.\n\n&gt; \u201cFarmers and ranchers are the original environmentalists, I say,\u201d said Lies, who heads the North Dakota Farm Bureau. \u201cWe\u2019re not the activists, like we hear across the nation, but we are the real environmentalists. We care about taking care of our land and having it there for the next generation.\u201d\n\n&gt; The Trump-era rule eased the path for several construction projects, including a commercial, industrial and residential park along the Savannah River, which forms the border between South Carolina and Georgia.\n\n&gt; The RiverPort project came with the promise of jobs in shipping and construction. But wildlife officials at the nearby Savannah National Wildlife Refuge warned in 2010 the proposal \u201crepresents a significant threat\u201d to its bottomland hardwoods of gum and maple trees and freshwater marshes that attract migrating waterfowl.\n\n&gt; Yet after the Trump administration rolled back the Obama-era rule, more than 200 acres of the wetlands in the project\u2019s footprint fell out of federal oversight, according to the Southern Environmental Law Center, which is suing the EPA over the regulation.\n\n&gt; \u201cEvery day the rule is in place, we are losing protections for 92 percent of wetlands, waters and streams,\u201d said Kelly Moser, a senior attorney at the Charlottesville-based legal advocacy group, citing the organization\u2019s analysis of the impact of the Trump rule.\n\n&gt; In total, the EPA and Army Corps said they are aware of 333 projects that no longer require federal water permits under the Trump rule.\n\n&gt; A former regulator from the purple state of North Carolina, Regan arrived in Washington with a reputation as a consensus builder and has spent much of his first months in office listening to both sides of the debate over water protections. Lies was among several people in North Dakota\u2019s agriculture and oil industries Regan met with last week on a trip to Bismarck hosted by Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.).\n\n&gt; \u201cI\u2019m cautiously optimistic that we\u2019ll be able to work with this EPA administrator and that he truly is sincere about getting out and getting input,\u201d Lies said.\n\n&gt; But the fate of the EPA\u2019s effort ultimately will hang in the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n&gt; At the center of the decades-long legal storm over water protections is the Clean Water Act, which bans pollution in a \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d without a permit. The question of what constitutes such water has been up for debate since the law\u2019s passage in 1972.\n\n&gt; In a 2006 decision, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote federal officials could step in when there was a \u201csignificant nexus\u201d between smaller and larger bodies of water. The Obama administration wrote its rule around that standard.\n\n&gt; With the announcement Wednesday, the Biden administration is kicking off a lengthy rulemaking process. It must first strike down the Trump rule before setting its own definition for which waterways get federal protection.\n\n&gt; But after Kennedy\u2019s retirement and with the Supreme Court taking an even more conservative turn with the appointments of three justices by Trump, it\u2019s unclear what sort of rule could now pass muster.\n\n&gt; \u201cThat is the $64 million question, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Patrick Parenteau, a professor of natural resources law at Vermont Law School. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be a rule that gets five votes on the Supreme Court, and that\u2019s going to be \u2026 difficult.\u201d\n\n!ping ECO",

This muck prevents new growth of plants. Clear waterways turn off colored because the muck doubles as silt in our waters. Silted waters make it hard for seagrass and plants and oysters to grow.\n\nIn general, stop this hyper growth and development killing our waters and green areas. Cap growth. Force developers to help pay for infrastructure upgrades.

Once they had a foothold there was zero species here who ate / could eat them and they quickly flourished. They seemed like a great thing at the time, but quickly we started noticing them, a few at a time on decks of ships, or the wheels etc. Then very quickly they coated the shallow wrecks and made the into just lumps of mussels on the bottom with zero wood to be found.\n\nAt one point the Canadian Government paid to start having some of the wrecks surveyed and I was one of the lucky few that was able to be part of that group, few free dive weekends, lots of cool ships and lots of measurements.

At one point I heard an estimate that the mussels in lake Erie were were over 10 feet deep in the deepest parts of that lake (shallowest of the great lakes, about 160 - 190' I think). They made their way north and east. The last time I dove at depth they had started to coat some of those wrecks as well.  We are talking fairly deep too.\n\nSo they introduced Gobbi fish (think that's the spelling) because the government thought, hey why not bring another foreign invasive species to the waters that have zero natural enemies and hope.. HOPE..they eat the zebra mussels, well they didn't turns out the zebra mussels weren't as tasty as our mussels or our bait fish, the gobbi's thrived along side of our zebra mussels and now the ecosystem of the great lakes is fairly well messed up.\n\nif I sound angry, I am.

        "The article:\n\nWith a vast portion of the United States coping with exceptional drought this summer, conditions are ripe in many places for harmful algal blooms, bringing additional threats to already-stressed water systems and increased health risks for communities.\n\nThe blooms are in large part fueled by phosphorus and nitrogen runoff from industrial agricultural operations, which provide a feast of nutrients for cyanobacteria \u2014 a group of aquatic, photosynthetic bacteria that grow out of control and overwhelm their ecosystems in the presence of excess nutrients.\n\nTo protect humans and animals from potentially lethal effects of the blooms, officials have closed beaches in Wisconsin and temporarily shuttered shellfish harvesting in Florida. Annual blooms in Oregon have contributed to what has become a full-blown water war at the California border.\n\nTo the possible relief of residents living in parts of Ohio, Michigan and Ontario, many of whom have come to intimately know the telltale stench and economic impacts that wash up when a toxic soup of algae blankets the water, scientists with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) have predicted a lower-than-average algal bloom in Lake Erie this year.\n\nBut a growing body of environmental health research links harmful algal blooms across the world to chronic health conditions spurred by microcystin: a kind of cyanobacteria linked to liver failure and increasingly, cancer. Some residents in downstream communities who have lived through past algal bloom-spurred water crises are still bracing for the worst.\n\nAlicia Smith is executive director of The Junction Coalition, a neighborhood organization focused on social, environmental, economic and peace education that formed in response to the Toledo, Ohio, water crisis in 2014, which left 500,000 people without drinking water. \u201cSeven years later we still hold our breath wondering if in July, August and September we will get a notification that we can\u2019t drink, touch or bathe in the water,\u201d Smith told Truthout.\n\nSmith estimates that a majority of community members in her area in Toledo, known as the Junction neighborhood, were not aware of dangerous levels of microcystin in the water at the time. \u201cWe had to get football players and basketball players from our local schools to help canvas and drop off water,\u201d she said.\n\nSince then, in an attempt to avoid another algal bloom-fueled water crisis, a new regional commission has planned to invest in improvements to its water treatment facilities, including a $100 million new water intake system and $70 million water towers, as the Toledo Blade reported. But the cost is being passed off on city residents, whom the Blade estimated would pay double the cost of 2019 water prices by 2025.\n\nFor many Toledo residents, those prices are prompting an affordability crisis, Smith said, noting that residents still worry that water flowing through the tap may be making family members sick.\n\nA Burst in Blooms?\n\nAlgal blooms are nothing new. According to a June article in Nature, Japanese explorers reported \u201cred waters,\u201d known now as \u201cred tides,\u201d as early as the year 731. But agricultural runoff from industrial farms and lawns and a lapse in limits and enforcement around nutrient runoff may be leading to bigger blooms. Research by the United Nations Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission has suggested that the harm caused by blooms strongly correlates with the growth of the aquaculture industry.\n\nThe tame 2021 NOAA prediction for Lake Erie is based in part on lower-than-average March and April rains this year, which brought minimal phosphorus discharge. Hans W. Paerl, a professor at the University of North Carolina Institute of Marine Sciences, told Truthout that, at the end of the day, the NOAA algal bloom forecast is only a prediction. After a dry early spring, May and June ended up bringing higher-than-average rainfall and with it, nutrients, such that if a significant drought were to set in, conditions could change \u2014 though drought conditions in northwest Ohio remain more moderate than much of the rest of the U.S.\n\nThe kind of extremes that the climate crisis brings makes the NOAA\u2019s job a tough one, Paerl said, and means the bloom prediction could swiftly go awry. \u201cIf the water suddenly slows down, well then those nutrients are going to be sitting in the lake, you know, ready to support a bloom.\u201d\n\nThrough Water, Through Air\n\n\u201cOhio has a very chronic problem,\u201d Jiyoung Lee, an environmental health sciences professor at Ohio State University, told Truthout, as does much of the rest of the world.\n\nLee has been studying cancer data in the U.S. and in South Korea for the past 10 years. Together with a wide-ranging team of collaborators, Lee has found that microcystin strongly correlates with increased rates of liver cancer. In a 2020 article, the team compared cancer data from Ohio residents diagnosed with a malignant tumor between 2000 and 2014. They linked those cases to respective census tracts, allowing the team to connect a given person to their drinking water source.\n\nUsing satellite sensing to generate a list of surface water sources with visible cyanobacteria blooms from 2002 to 2011, Lee\u2019s research team found that people whose water came from lakes and rivers impacted by algal blooms had a 17 percent higher incidence of liver cancer in comparison with those estimated to receive groundwater \u2014 a source coming from cooler and darker underground sources where algal blooms are not prevalent. Census tracts estimated to be served by bloom-impacted waters were also linked with higher levels of poverty and more likely to be coded as non-white.\n\nLee says exposure is commonly understood as occurring by sipping contaminated water, eating fish living in impacted ecosystems, or coming in physical contact through recreational activities like swimming or angling.\n\nBut exposure happens in more subtle ways too. Now, Lee is studying how the use of bloom-impacted water to irrigate crops like carrots and lettuce might also be contributing to the incidence of liver disease. The research is particularly pertinent given that 70 percent of freshwater withdrawals around the world go to irrigating agricultural fields, according to the United States Geological Survey. \u201cWe need to look at [exposure] in a more holistic way,\u201d Lee said, noting potential links between other cyanotoxins and neurological conditions like Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nA 2020 review by Paerl found that people might face exposure to toxins in even more passive ways, by inhaling aerosol particles from bloom-impacted sources that drift off of water flowing through household faucets.\n\n\u201cZero Maggots\u201d\n\nWhile there is no one-size-fits-all fix for harmful algal blooms, Paerl said; there are plenty of what he calls \u201cnon-rocket science solutions,\u201d like leaving native vegetation to serve as a buffer between development and waterways rather than carpeting the ground with grass, and ensuring that that septic systems are not leaking into water systems.\n\nMost essential, Paerl said, is reducing the inputs that lead to algal blooms. \u201cThe knob we can tweak is the nutrient knob.\u201d\n\nKristy Meyer is associate director of Freshwater Futures, a nonprofit focused on building political power to promote water democracy and empower residents to protect the Great Lakes. She says the Biden administration should expand which waters qualify as \u201cWaters of the United States\u201d \u2014 those that are protected under the Clean Water Act. In 2020, the Trump administration stripped federal protections for wetlands and streams. \u201cI think of Lake Erie like a heart,\u201d Meyer said. \u201cIf you cut off part of the capillaries, or the arteries, the heart starts to die. That\u2019s basically what we\u2019re doing when we roll back the Waters of the U.S.\u201d\n\nA new, more expansive rule, would allow regulators to set a daily limit on nutrients for smaller water bodies like wetlands and streams, requiring industrial-scale operations like factory or monocrop operations to figure out how to decrease what they\u2019re releasing to a certain level or face consequences. Meyer also suggests that the next iteration of the farm bill, set to expire in 2023, should include provisions requiring agricultural operations receiving federal subsidies to be subject to a nutrient monitoring plan. Existing federal law sidesteps the nutrient runoff problem, as the Associated Press reported in 2017.\n\nIncreased protections are also needed from a public health standpoint, Toledo residents say. According to the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, drinking water is safe for adults so long as it contains less than 1.6 microgram per liter of microcystin. The World Health Organization\u2019s limit is 1 microgram per liter. No health guidelines yet exist in the U.S. spelling out safe levels of microcystin in food, a guideline that researchers like Lee would like to see established.\n\nSmith says health standards that allow for any level of a toxic substance to enter human bodies are not good enough from a justice point of view, given the legacy of health disparities that map onto race and class in the U.S.\n\n\u201cWe always have these wonderful numbers: Five [micrograms per deciliter] of lead is allowed. That\u2019s better than, you know, 15\u2026. But zero is the amount of lead that is safe for consumption,\u201d Smith says.\n\nIn the same sense, Smith contends that no level of microcystin is safe for consumption, and that local, state and federal governments should work toward fully eliminating it, and other toxins, from water and food systems.\n\n\u201cZero maggots is what I want to eat,\u201d Smith said.",

        "Those of you who think the boomers wrecked the world, the generation before the boomers did this endlessly, and the boomers had to pay to clean it up. \n\nThe greatest generation believed that the environment was so vast, that any amount of pollution would be a drop in the ocean, so to speak.  Living standards advanced rapidly so no one really cared.  It turns out things are really cheap if you can just exhaust your pollution to a limitless environment.\n\nBoomers inherited superfund sites, a disappearing ozone layer, air pollution so bad you couldn't see the sun, ever, in Los Angeles, and rivers and lakes so polluted that the rivers into lake Erie routinely caught on fire.  Yes, the river.\n\nIn order to pay the immense costs of a cleanup, politicians turned to pensions.  The country deferred paying its civil servants so that boomers could receive the benefits the civil servants provided, while the generations after the boomers paid all of the costs for the benefits the boomers got.  To get the civil servants to agree to defer their income, we promised them guaranteed returns on the money they deferred that would be far in excess of anything they could ever earn themselves.  Then, instead of putting that money away year by year, we just ignored it, and left all those costs for the next generation.  \n\nThe insanity was not extended to the post office, once it became clear that the post office would be forever shrinking.  Unlike what the media tries to tell you, when someone is hired for the post office, no one puts away 70 years worth of pension payments, but they do put away one year, every year, so that when the post office is half its size, the pensions will be there.  So someone who earns $45,000 and  is expected to work for 50 years has 1/50th of their total estimated pension payout set aside each year by setting postal rates to the appropriate amount to cover it.  That means the people who mail letters today will pay for the pension of the letter carrier who carries that letter today. You won't be stuck with that cost.\n\nThe boomers will pay for those pensions.  All other pensions are unfunded, and generations after the boomers will pay for those pensions for services the boomers got, but you will now pay for.  Thats how all this mess was cleaned up without impacting current living standards.  It will of course impact your living standards.  Thanks boomers!",

I toured the mine back in the 90's. The seam that I stood in was at least 40 feet thick. We were told by the tour guide that it took 10,000 years to precipitate a one inch of thickness. Geologic time is amazing. The salt beds extend east to New York state and are mined throughout the region. Salt mining is also happening  in SE Ontario as well. The salt is turned into table salt used for human consumption but I think most of it is spread out over our roads in the winter to melt all the snow we get.

In that case, this is also a benefit to you.\n\nFor iii), what benefit does this provide to you as homeowners?\n\nIt's a done deal at this point frankly, but I would want to know how Exactly my property has been improved in writing.

The development of these apartments will also increase the intensity of runoff directly into the water there which could negatively impact bank stability and so the reinforcement of the banks and removal of trees may be part of an effort to mitigate future bank erosion.\n\n[From the concept plans for the apartment development](https://www.cityofsylvania.com/businesses/economic-development/current-development-projects/the-somo-project/) there is proposed work shown directly along the north bank of Tenmile Creek and the West Bank of North Tenmile Creek. There seems to be an emphasis in this development of creating spaces with views of the water (whether from apartments or the open spaces), and while that sounds nice, it may be unfortunate as the trees and vegetation that line streams (also called riparian vegetation) are very important for the health and quality of the streams and the waters downstream (e.g. Lake Erie). Clear cutting trees along the banks and replacing them with an occasional tree and the rest as turf grass (which will possibly be fertilized by a landscaper and result in additional nutrient pollution) is a step down for water quality, and as OP mentioned definitely a step down from the original forested feel of the area felt under the existing tree canopy. That being said if we are talking about trees being removed on the south bank of Tenmile Creek, even if that were done in support of bank stabilization for this development, there would be no reason not to replant [native] vegetation in that park area (though obviously it takes a while for plants to grow and the canopy to recover).\n\nI\u2019m making these comments from a distance right now so I haven\u2019t seen any of this recent development in person and I may be off on how some of this is actually shaping up in reality.",

The sand dunes, the lakes, the holiday's at a family's cabin were all things I loved. I hate being so far away from clean water. The water here is so bad. If I can put my hand under the water and it vanishes its a no go and sadly most of the water is like that. I miss seeing little fish swim and nibble on my toes, I miss the clear water of Lake Michigan (lake Erie was pretty dirty where I lived so we didnt swim in that lake). \n\nI also suffer from barometric weather changes pretty bad. Sometimes 3 days before it rains or snows i'll be laid up in bed because I get to dizzy I often hurt myself by just walking, I've passed out and fallen off the stairs (my bottom 4 are open), I've fallen off the sidewalk and twisted my foot, didnt pick my foot up high enough and tripped and fell into a wood beam outside my bathroom. And the weather changes constantly here, im just always in a state of depression and anxiety because of it, im not living life, im just living. \n\nI went to my cousins in Arkansas and it was beautiful, I went to a waterfall, went and collected crystals, floated in a lake with a mountain in the background, went and sat in a hot spring. I was just so at peace there, but I wouldn't want to live there. But I want to go to Maine, its been on my list for years and my friends and I all had plans to go in July but with covid no one had extra money cause they were all put on part time hours on rotations and some picked up extra jobs. We looked at moving there back in 2011 and my friends who live in that area love it. \n\nIt sucks cause I feel trapped here. Im in a house I hate and have always hated. My parents when we tried to sell hounded me with texts daily about moving and we were only planning on moving 30 minutes away to be closer to work and when we couldn't sell told me how happy they were no one wanted my house. My husbands family is here all of them, so he wont leave. He just started up a new business venture, which I did approve but now kinda wish I hadn't cause at some point im gonna have to pull the plug and demand we move to the coast with more steady weather. My kid is showing symptoms of the same migraines I get and I feel so bad for her cause she's stuck here also suffering migraines and she only 8 its going to get so much worse as she gets older and it weights on me a lot.",

Luckily, nitrogen-based fertilizers aren't as effective at causing phytoplankton growth, and phosphorus-based fertilizers, while they're very, very good at causing growth, they're \"sticky\" so they have a harder time getting to bodies of water from where they're applied. \n - UNfortunately, so much of both is being used that they make their way there anyway. \n- Phytoplankton (including algae) eat up the fertilizer\n - Some of the blooms are toxic, others just cause more water turbidity\n- Zooplankton eat the algae, reproduce, eat more\n- Fish eat the zooplankton, reproduce, at as much as they can\n- Algae is depleted, and a massive population of zooplankton starve. Zooplankton is depleted, and all the fish begin to starve\n- You are left with, eventually, if left unmitigated, a beautiful sparkling blue lake that's completely dead. \n\nSome of the smaller finger lakes went through bouts of eutrophication like this. This is going back a number of years, but I think I recall Skaneateles lake going through this. All the nearby farmland runoff eventually killed the lake as described (lots of pig farms with very, very, very phosphorous-rich byproducts (poop). \n\n***\n\nThe bulk of the effects are not going to be tied to residential use of retail fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides. That runoff is minimal and often gets broken down or processed before it can make it to a larger body of water, and when it gets there, the amounts are too small to be troubling. The major concern is large farm use of these things, as the quantities are very high (glyphosate application essentially ends up with an entire field saturated in RoundUp as if a heavy rain just pummeled the area). \n\n***\n\nOverall, we need to work hard to:\n\n- Manage farm fertilizer and poop runoff\n- Understand and manage the runoff coming from heavy glyphosate use\n- Continue to manage and protect the Lake Erie and surrounding lakes/rivers' watersheds\n- Worry less about what John Smith is buying at Walmart for his lawn, and worry more about what farmer john, golf courses, and large \"mow the grass\" parks are doing to manage their vegetation.",

It was always stupid, one week it was ok, next week it wasn't. The advisories were always just a few points away from stopping people. I'd go swimming but only for very short periods and a very good shower immediately after. \n\nAnd on my walks along the beach? There were dead fish that regularly washed up and on the first week of July was the worst with hundreds of dead fish every mile and it literally stank up the shoreline for miles. \n\nThe Great Lakes, especially Lake Erie, aren't getting worse, they are already terrible.",

        "To first answer your question before writing a bunch of possibly TL;DR stuff, many cities use full capture devices to prevent trash from going into the ocean and/or ending up on beaches. I've never seen Mr. Trash Wheel before, but it appears to be just a device that removes the trash once it is captured in the net. Full capture is an end-of-pipe solution, but there are also ways to prevent trash from entering storm drains in the first place. [Here's the EPA page on various trash capture technologies.](https://www.epa.gov/trash-free-waters/trash-capture-technologies)The easiest solution would be to make sure no trash ends up on the street in the first place, but public behavior isn't that easy to sway. It takes decades, and can be reversed. \n\nAs far as how much trash makes it out to the deep ocean, or to the garbage patch, I have no idea. It comes from countries all over the Pacific Rim, but most comes from China, Indonesia, Vietnam, and some other East- and Southeast Asian countries.\n\n\\--\n\nI love my job because I feel like I'm helping to make the world a better place, and I work with a bunch of people who share the sentiment. We could also go work in private industry and make more money, but we're passionate about what we do. I just wanted to shed some light on the situation because it can feel like no one cares and no one is doing anything. Before I started working at the Water Board, none of this was apparent.  When I was reading our TMDL for trash and debris in Santa Monica Bay, I realized why the city of Manhattan Beach had banned smoking outdoors and polystyrene; if municipalities outlaw certain disposable items that often end up in storm drains, they get a few extra years to come into compliance with all the other requirements.\n\nHaving the resources and time to crunch the data is only the beginning, and the shortest step in the process. Dischargers need to change their processes and that can take years. Sometimes infrastructure needs to be retired, altered, or built. The final compliance deadline for California power plants to stop using once-through cooling water, for example, is 20 years for one facility. Another facility knew it would not be able to meet the requirements and chose to cease operations. That may be fine for one low-output power plant, but cities will flood if the storm drains were not operational. Parts of the San Fernando flood anyway even with functional drains. \n\nHave you ever been at working waiting on someone to give you something so you could do their job, but they're waiting on someone, and that person is waiting on someone, and so on? It's kind of like that. There are so many moving pieces not even counting red tape, that changes take years and years. I know its frustrating when it seems like we don't have time. New solutions are being developed all the time, like the city of Santa Monica's Urban Runoff Recycling Facility, which recovers dry weather urban runoff and removes pollutants so the water can be used for non-potable purposes.",

And I don't want to short sell that.  \"Over fertilizing\" the water can be fatal.  Some of those microbes that grow cause infections, and just a few years ago in Toledo Ohio (where lake Erie gets more shallow and therefore warmer) they had some deaths because of an toxic algae bloom the drinking water plant wasn't built to handle.\n\nBut it's funny, stateside, there's a growing push for recycled water (ie: toilet to tap).  I doubt Canada will ever have a need, but California sure does.  It gets pushback for the optics, but I always kind of laugh.

Which is how I got this:\n\n\nTom Henry\nThe Blade\nthenry@theblade.com\nJan 7, 2021\n12:10 PM\n\nLest there be any confusion, agricultural runoff is western Lake Erie\u2019s biggest source of algae-forming nutrients.\n\nA third Ohio Environmental Protection Agency study since 2016 has confirmed that through science, firming up past conclusions.  \n\nThe agency has been doing that through so-called \u201cnutrient mass balance\u201d studies which look at data that tracks algae-forming phosphorus across the state.\n\nIn 2015, the Ohio General Assembly passed a law requiring them to be done once every two years.\n\nThat decision came in response to Toledo\u2019s 2014 algae-driven water crisis, when the city\u2019s tap water was deemed unsafe to drink or touch over the first weekend of August that year because an algal poison from the lake had breached the city\u2019s treatment system.\n\nFor those studies, the Ohio EPA uses the best available data to determine the percentages of algae-growing phosphorus and nitrogen coming from non-point sources - primarily farm runoff - or point sources, typically sewage treatment plants and their system overflows.\n\nNorthwest Ohio\u2019s Maumee and Sandusky rivers were among 11 watersheds examined across the state.\n\nThe most recent report, issued on Christmas Eve, didn\u2019t deviate much from the 2018 study - not that anyone expected a large shift within such a relatively short amount of time.\n\nThe latest report shows 89 percent of the Maumee River\u2019s phosphorus comes from non-point sources such as agricultural runoff, compared to 88 percent in 2018.\n\nIt also shows non-point sources - again, primarily agriculture - account for 92 percent of the Sandusky River\u2019s phosphorus now, compared to 93 percent in 2018.\n\nPercentages vary from stream to stream, but - for much of the state - consistently show agriculture as a primary driver. One exception is the Cuyahoga River watershed near Cleveland, because it is much more urbanized than streams in northwest Ohio and elsewhere.\n\n\u201cSignificant changes generally are not expected over a short time period,\u201d Heidi Griesmer, Ohio EPA spokesman, said. \u201cHowever, in addition to being required by law every two years, the nutrient studies help us track trends over short periods. Over longer periods, the data compiled will identify whether significant changes are occurring. The next report is due in 2022 and will include nine years of data for comparison.\u201d\n\nTy Higgins, Ohio Farm Bureau Federation spokesman, said there \u201cis simply not enough data to show any definitive trends\u201d yet.\n\n\u201cBut he agreed the findings, along with other current water quality research, are \u201ckey components to finding science-based solutions for clean water and more data will certainly be helpful as future studies are released.\u201d\n\nPhosphorus is the nutrient most closely associated with algal bloom sizes, while nitrogen often influences toxicity.\n\nOne reason for the heavy input from agriculture: Seventy-nine percent of the Maumee River watershed\u2019s land is in agricultural production.\n\nIn the Sandusky River watershed, 80 percent of the land is in agricultural production.\n\nRunoff figures in spring and early summer \u2014 when most of the fertilizers are applied \u2014 often are dictated by not only volumes of rainfall between March 1 and July 31, but also the severity, timing, and duration of thunderstorms, experts have said.\n\nMs. Griesmer said the latest study \u201cconfirms information from previous [nutrient mass balance] work about phosphorus loading.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis information confirms that H2Ohio is on the right path in focusing on the agricultural sources of phosphorus running into the western basin of Lake Erie,\u201d she said.\n\nShelby Croft, Ohio Department of Agriculture spokesman, said that agency has been focused on water quality issues for years. It, too, has confidence in the DeWine administration\u2019s H2Ohio program, although she did not rule out the possibility of adjustments as more science comes in.\n\n\u201cODA has learned many things about delivering the H2Ohio program in the past 11 months, and undoubtedly what we\u2019ve learned will lead to tweaks in program structure and delivery methods in the future,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. Croft said the state agriculture department remains committed to programs based around voluntary incentives.\n\n\u201cMoving forward, additional research and monitoring data will likely cause adjustments to [best management practices] offered through the program, or may bring new practices into the program,\u201d she said.\n\nEnvironmentalists said they saw shortcomings in the latest report.\n\nPam Taylor of Environmentally Concerned Citizens of South Central Michigan said it\u2019s \u201cno surprise that the watersheds in northwest Ohio continue to be highest nonpoint sources of phosphorus.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe continue to test the water in Michigan\u2019s portion of both the Maumee and Raisin watersheds, as we\u2019ve done for 20 years, and have seen no improvement,\u201d she said. \u201cUntil the application of liquid manure over subsurface drain tiles is restricted in the western Lake Erie region, and until the states involved and the U.S. EPA demand accountability in the form of water tests instead of soil tests or evidence of best practices, nothing will change and the millions of dollars spent on remediation for harmful algae and bacterial pollution problems here will continue to be wasted.\u201d\n\nMike Ferner, Advocates for a Clean Lake Erie founder, described the report as \u201ctwo more years of [the Ohio EPA] kicking the can down the road, telling us what we already know: the lion\u2019s share of what\u2019s poisoning Lake Erie comes from agriculture.\u201d\n\nSandy Bihn, Lake Erie Waterkeeper founder, said this and previous reports \u201care remiss in reporting the massive increases\u201d in manure generated by livestock facilities close to or large enough to be known as concentrated animal feeding operations, or CAFOs.\n\n\u201cFailing to disclose major manure increases in the Maumee and failing to divide agriculture into commercial fertilizer and manure means that Ohio wants to tout the H2O rhetoric to make it look like Ohio cares about Lake Erie, but in reality Ohio is doing little to nothing to reduce manure sources,\u201d she said.\n\nFirst Published January 7, 2021, 8:42am",

The zebra mussels are definitely a nuisance, especially for boat owners and any water intake systems but they sure filtered that Lake and cleaned it up in a way that nothing else could have.

        "That\u2019s just not true though. Hunting is not a blanket solution: if everyone hunted, wild game animals would go extinct immediately; there simply isn\u2019t enough of them to sustain billions of people. Fishing is dangerous, too, with nearly all saltwater fish being precariously overfished already, and freshwater fish are often understudied, underregulated, and threatened as well (see Asian carp, lampreys, and look into \u2018tire dust,\u2019 and further, consider that the climate is changing- here by the Great Lakes, for example, Lake Erie has had some 1.5% ice cover so far, while the average by this time is at 15%. This means a LOT to the animals living in the lake as it greatly affects clarity of environment aka feeding for fish). Local farmers are, yes, generally more eco-friendly than factory farms, but since about 99% of all animal products come from factory farms (99.9% of eggs), it\u2019s pretty likely neither you nor any of your friends are shopping local family farms (Source; sentience institute via USDA &amp; epa). Additionally, in a horribly sad irony, local/humane farming is STILL not sustainable, and perhaps less so than factory farms. There is simply not enough land to raise all those billions of animals humanely- animal agriculture already takes up 50% of usable land, and 80% of food crops go to feeding animal agriculture. \n\nSo, while perhaps there is variance to how destructive an animal-based diet is, it remains that eating plant based is the ONLY ethical option.\n\nPlant based is hardly extreme. What\u2019s extreme is having the option to eat a less environmentally destructive diet during the sixth great extinction, and not.",

As Cleveland emerged as a major center for manufacturing, the river became heavily affected by industrial pollution, so much so that it \"caught fire\" at least 13 times, most famously on June 22, 1969, helping to spur the American environmental movement. Since then, the river has been extensively cleaned up through the efforts of Cleveland's city government and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA). In 2019, the American Rivers conservation association named the Cuyahoga \"River of the Year\" in honor of \"50 years of environmental resurgence.\"  \n\n[^(About Me)](https://np.reddit.com/user/wikipedia_text_bot/comments/jrn2mj/about_me/) ^- [^(Opt out)](https://np.reddit.com/user/wikipedia_text_bot/comments/jrti43/opt_out_here/) ^(- OP can reply !delete to delete) ^- [^(Article of the day)](https://np.reddit.com/comments/k9hx22)\n\n**This bot will soon be transitioning to an opt-in system.

The state can collect taxes by force, but a private company cannot make a profit by violating other people's property rights. The main characteristic of the market is the system of property rights.\n\nGo back to what I said\n\n&gt; The market cannot solve problems where the market is not allowed to exist.\n\n&gt; The market cannot solve the problem of air, river and ocean pollution, as long as these resources are state-owned.

But consider what would happen if private firms were able to own the rivers and the lakes. If a private firm owned Lake Erie, for example, then anyone dumping garbage in the lake would be promptly sued in the courts for their aggression against private property and would be forced by the courts to pay damages and to cease and desist from any further aggression.\n\nIn fact, it is government officials who have no reason to care about the environment, which has proven to be true through practice, letting state-owned resources be polluted.\n\n&gt; or stopping a meteor from hitting our planet\n\nPrivate companies solve an unimaginable number of problems, why not this one as well.

In a fully privatized system, there would also be private cities, private streets and more, which would make rules for themselves in relation to the risk they feel.

We have some pretty cool areas to hike but tbh I don\u2019t think they get marketed or maintained well enough to be as big of a draw as they should be. I wish people would associate Ohio with awesome woodlands, meadows and wetlands with nice meandering streams. But that would take a lot of funding and work to eradicate honeysuckle and other invasive species from old growth forests, regrow and redrajn wetlands, building boardwalks, marketing &amp; publicizing, etc. to get this done.\n\nOhio could have some pretty sweet beaches too but our legislators are too interested bending over backwards to accommodate the farming lobby. Regulations need to be put on allowable runoff from farm fields to reduce the amount of toxic waste running into the water. This waste causes algae blooms in places like Lake Erie and Grand Lake St Mary\u2019s, making the water completely toxic. The Zebra mussel and Asian Carp crises need to be handled too.\nMake the lakes nice and we become a great alternative vacation spot to Michigan or places like Lake Cumberland.\n\nSame goes for our cities. Over the past 10 years finally the right things are being done. But we can\u2019t stop. The 3Cs need expansive mass transit to stay competitive. Not just one streetcar, but full light rail that stretches out into the inner ring suburbs to encourage transit-oriented development. Development barriers need to be created to rein in sprawl. More focus needs to be put on redeveloping blighted areas while allowing the people in those areas to be lifted up in the process. Other cities in other states have done it (Denver, Portland, Minneapolis to name a few). We can do it too in Ohio.\n\nWhat\u2019s great about Ohio is our location, our roads, our industry, and our diversity in both people and topography. If you want to do it, Ohio will probably have it somewhere.\n\nSo Ohio to me is like the grand Victorian with finishes from the 1980s... rough on the edges, in need of a lot of work, but 100% fixable.

This is also the same livestock industry that supplies the red meats and processed meats Americans consume to excess, increasing the rates of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and some cancers.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;On the environmental side, runoff from livestock farms in the United States pollutes rivers and streams, degrading large bodies of water like Lake Erie and the Chesapeake Bay. The livestock industry is also a significant emitter of climate-warming greenhouse gases, contributing nearly [15 percent](https://uk.reuters.com/article/global-livestock-emissions/feature-fighting-global-warming-one-cow-belch-at-a-time-idUKL8N1U953J) of such emissions around the world.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;If imitation meat products from plant materials could begin replacing some of the real meat in our diets, all of these problems might be diminished. The fashion industry has learned to substitute imitation fur for the real thing; the shoe industry has learned to use imitation leather; imitation ivory has helped save elephants; and some imitation egg and dairy products are already a commercial success. Plant-based milks (made from almonds, oats, soy or coconuts, for example) now account for [14 percent](https://www.gfi.org/marketresearch#:~:text=Plant%2Dbased%20milk%20now%20accounts,an%20opportunity%20worth%20%2412%20billion.) of retail milk sales in the United States.

Aquatic invasive species can alter the basic functions of the Great Lakes and all waterways, disrupting fisheries, wildlife, and water supplies.\u00a0\u00a0\n* **Committing to assisting states in meeting their goals of reducing nutrient pollution in the Western Lake Erie basin by 40 percent by 2025** through federal funding, resources, and new technologies while continuing to monitor, report, and reduce nutrient pollution in the other Great Lakes and regional water bodies. Harmful algal outbreaks threaten our drinking water, economy, outdoor recreation, and fish and wildlife.\u00a0\u00a0\n* **Supporting federal funding for ports, harbors, and critical marine infrastructure including the Soo Locks reconstruction project at Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan.** In addition to $52 million provided by the State of Michigan, $900 million is needed to modernize the Soo Locks and ensure they remain operational through reconstruction. A six-month unplanned closure at the Soo Locks would devastate the production of integrated steel, automobiles, and other heavy equipment throughout North America, decreasing U.S. gross domestic product by $1.3 trillion, costing the U.S. more than 11 million jobs.\u00a0\n* **Push for increased federal action of both the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Defense to address PFAS contamination.** Across the Great Lakes region, states are tackling the challenge of addressing toxic contaminants like PFAS chemicals.

A federal study found that the added diversion from Lake Erie, along with what was already being used for the Welland Canal, and power plants in the US and Canada, could be enough to slow the American Falls to a trickle.  It would also have been ridiculously expensive.",

If you draw water from a 50 m deep well (a lot of the Region's wells are this deep) and then dump it back into the ground at the surface in a totally different location, you've completely altered that water's fate - in all likelihood that water was hundred+ year old rainwater (within a regional aquifer that naturally slowly, slowly, slowly moves water to regional discharge features like major creeks and the Grand River - like over thousands of years) when it was pumped, and dumping it back into the ground at surface, now it's part of the shallow flow system most likely to discharge to a local drainage ditch or small creek, from there it'll go to the grand and then Lake Erie, gone from the watershed far faster than it would have otherwise.\n\n\" And don't all cities have substantial (more than 10%) freshwater loss in the delivery network? \" Yes absolutely.

Unless you're saying that the 1\u00b0 rise in global temperature, isn't enough to convert snow to water? I guess that is technically true in some cases. It might not directly impact it, but there's so many other factors to consider. The slight increase in temp changes when and how long Lake Erie freezes over. This drastically impacts local climates. The rise in temps also creates massive algae blooms, which leads to worsening storms. Higher temps have been linked to less snow fall, but increased precipitation, leading to flooding, soil erosion and nutrient loss. Global warming is so much more in-depth then most people realize. Some areas will notice the impacts significantly more than others. \n\nYou can look all this stuff up, it isn't my opinion.

        "&gt; Typically, a helium-filled latex balloon that is released outdoors will stay aloft long enough to be fully deflated before it descends to Earth. However, the Balloonfest balloons collided with a front of cool air and rain and dropped towards the ground, still inflated, clogging the land and waterways of Northeast Ohio. In the days following the event, balloons were reported washed ashore on the Canadian side of Lake Erie.\n\n&gt; Two fishermen, Raymond Broderick and Bernard Sulzer, who had gone out on September 26, were reported missing by their families on the day of the event. Rescuers spotted their overturned 16-foot (4.9 m) boat anchored west of the Edgewater Park breakwall. A Coast Guard search and rescue helicopter crew had difficulties reaching the area because of the \"asteroid field\" of balloons. A search-and-rescue boat crew tried to spot the fishermen floating in the lake, but Guard officials said balloons in the water made it impossible to see whether anyone was in the lake. On September 29, the Coast Guard suspended its search. The fishermen's bodies subsequently washed ashore. The wife of one of the fishermen sued the United Way of Cleveland and the company that organized the balloon release for $3.2 million and later settled on undisclosed terms.\n\n&gt; Balloons landing on a pasture in Medina County, Ohio, spooked Louise Nowakowski's Arabian horses, which allegedly suffered permanent injuries as a result. Nowakowski sued the United Way of Cleveland for $100,000 in damages and settled for undisclosed terms.\n\n&gt; Burke Lakefront Airport had to shut down a runway for half an hour after balloons landed there. Traffic collisions were also reported \"as drivers swerved to avoid slow motion blizzards of multicolored orbs or took their eyes off the road to gawk at the overhead spectacle\". \n\n&gt; The 1988 copy of The Guinness Book of World Records recognizes the event as a world record \"largest ever mass balloon release\", with 1,429,643 balloons launched.\n\nEdit: Apparently public education is failing to teach reading comprehension.

        "Thank you for you for your assumptions. \n\n\n&gt; Nuclear: About 330,000 birds, by Sovacool\u2019s calculations.\n\nhttps://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/2014/08/22/pecking-order-energys-toll-on-birds\n\nFrom the paper abstract cited by U.S. News:\n\n&gt; Based on operating performance in the United States and Europe, the paper then offers a preliminary calculation of the number of birds killed per kilowatt-hour kWh generated for wind electricity, fossil fuel, and nuclear power systems. The study estimates that wind farms and nuclear power stations are responsible each for between 0.3 and 0.4 fatalities per gigawatt-hour (GWh) of electricity while fossil fueled power stations are responsible for about 5.2 fatalities per GWh. Within the uncertainties of the data used, the estimate means that wind farms killed approximately 20,000 birds in the United States in 2009 but **nuclear plants killed about 330,000** and fossil fueled power plants more than 14 million. \n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0960148112000857\n\nEdit: furthermore, I found a source offering the actual paper:\n\n&gt; The threat to avian wildlife from nuclear power plants can also be divided into upstream and downstream fatalities.\n&gt;Uranium milling and mining can poison and kill hundreds of birds per facility per year. Indeed, in early 2008 the Cotter Corpo- ration was fined $40,000 for the death of 40 geese and ducks at the Ca\u00f1on City Uranium Mill in Colorado. The birds apparently ingested contaminated water at one of the settling ponds at the uranium mine [1]. &gt;These deaths can be very roughly quantified into 0.006 deaths per GWh. &gt;The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service [31] has also noted that abandoned open pit uranium mines in Wyoming can form pit lakes hazardous to wildlife. Uranium-bearing formations are usually associated with strata containing high concentrations of selenium. It is not uncommon for these pits to kill 300 birds per year. Because those mines operated at about one-tenth the efficiency of Canon City, they would correlate to about 0.45 deaths per GWh. &gt;Taking the mean from both uranium mines gets us 0.228 fatalities per GWh.\n&gt;Like fossil fueled power stations and wind farms, avian fauna can also collide with nuclear power plants. Three thousand birds died in two successive nights in 1982 from collisions with smoke- stacks and cooling towers at Florida Power Corporation\u2019s Crystal River Generating Facility [1]. Given that the power plant now hosts an 838 MW nuclear reactor, and presuming it operated with a capacity factor of 90% and that the 3000 deaths were the only ones throughout the year, the facility was responsible for 0.454 avian deaths per GWh. Ornithologists observed 274 fatal bird collisions with an elevated cooling tower at the Limerick nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania from 1979 to 1980 [32]. Since the Limerick plant has a 1200 MW reactor, and also assuming it oper- ated at a 90% capacity factor, it was responsible for 0.261 deaths per GWh. At the Susquehanna plant in eastern Pennsylvania, 1500 dead birds were collected between 1978 and 1986 for an average of 187 fatalities per year [33]. Assuming that the 2200 MW plant operated at 90% capacity factor, it was responsible for 0.01 deaths per GWh. &gt;Extensive surveys for dead birds were also conducted at the Davis-Bess nuclear plant near Lake Erie in Northern Ohio. Orni- thologists recorded a total of 1554 bird fatalities or an average of 196 per year from 1972 to 1979 [33]. Given that the power plant hosts an 873 MW reactor, and assuming it operated with a 90% capacity factor, and the plant was responsible for 0.0285 fatalities per GWh. Taking the mean for each of the four power plants results in 0.188 deaths per GWh.\n&gt;The total avian deaths per GWh for nuclear power plants are therefore about 0.416.\n\nSource to read the paper:  https://www.bund-nrw.de/fileadmin/nrw/dokumente/Naturschutz/Vogelschlag/Literatur/Sovacool_2009_-_Avian_benefits_of_wind_energy.pdf",

Emissions by individual people aren\u2019t the big environmental culprits. \n\nHowever, if everyone stopped supporting meat/dairy industries there would be a notable impact in a different way. Nutrient pollution from agricultural run off is creating harmful algal blooms throughout freshwater systems in the US, for example. Lake Erie has enormous blooms each year. This creates anoxic zones which obliterate ecosystems. \n\nAlso, in terms of individual emissions. Air conditioning and refrigeration can be pretty big contributors.

I was out a good distance and without warning (okay, I was 17 and flirting, there may have been signs) fish began surfacing. Dead fish. It felt like hundreds or thousands (maybe less, but that's what my teenage brain remembered). Maybe the lake turned over in a spot? Methane bubble?  Whatever. No clue\n\nBut oh my sweet baby Jesus, swimming through those dead fish to get back to shore? It felt like miles. The dead fish were so thick I couldn't not touch them. These fish were... football sized or so. Every time I kicked, I kicked a fish. Every time I took a stroke, I hit a fish. They slid all over my body. There was no path without a fish. \n\nIt took ages to get to shore. I was in a program for high school kids to get to tour colleges. They paid for everything and we also got to do a bit of fun stuff occasionally, like a beach afternoon. So there was a large group of high school kids to be wrangled up EARLY.  Everyone had to load on the busses and we all had to ride back to the hotel together. Fishy, soggy, and scarred. \n\nEver since then, water that I can't see through makes me so uncomfortable. I get shaky, dizzy, light headed, I breathe heavy. Now I have a very hard time even stepping in murky water. Even if it's only a two inch deep puddle my brain freaks out about what might be in there. \n\nI miss swimming so much. I've gotten a bit better  and have conquered some of the fear.

The Otter Creek and other Creeks like Catfish Creek etc are naturally silty.  The wave action with the sands grittiness and the silt weight combine to create a very abrasive environment at the shoreline.  Currently the north shore of Lake Erie is the fastest changing shoreline in the world.   100 acre farms people used to own have all but vanished.   The road between Port Stanely and Port Bruce had to be moved because it was going to be washed away soon.\nDue to the sheer size of the bluffs (nearly 100 feet in most areas), there is no feasible way to engineer anything to stop this.   \nI imagine if this was somewhere like a highly populated community in NY or Massachusetts they would throw money at it but because it's in a sparsely populated area with farmland, noone has the money or interest in doing anything about it.  \nThe government does have a program that allows you to sell off your low value farmland that is likely to be impacted by the erosion, but it's hardly a fraction of the value of similarly sized farmland 1 km inland.",

All I\u2019ve learned over the years about the climate change timeline is being challenged at lightning speed.  Shit\u2019s going down by centuries and decades faster than I had ever imagined. I\u2019m not actually afraid, I\u2019m sickened and saddened at how obvious the events are occurring. I\u2019m from New Orleans, but moved to Western New York in 1993. I moved into my home Xmas eve 1993 and it snowed 58 straight days. FIFTY EIGHT MOTHERFUCKING DAYS!!! The entire front of my house disappeared as the snow on the ground met the snow on the roof. Several months were spent in walking an ice cave since I had 3 large picture windows down that long hallway. I was living in an ice cave. Snow plow service was $800 for 2 weeks. My driveway is 300 feet and the piles of snow on either side were about 4 feet taller than me, built by a powerful snow thrower. Driving out required getting out...and searching for any approaching vehicles; occasionally visibility was a matter of feet, so adrenaline was the drug of that era.  It was normal to have snowfall at the end of October that required plowing. That\u2019s not been the case in years.\n\nThat was the 90s. Today it\u2019s 48F. There\u2019s a mere scattering of snow and you have to look for it! I\u2019ve not needed a snow plow yet. Maybe in February? I checked my weather calendar (I keep my own records) and the usual temp right now was 0F. Yep, ZERO. 20 below was more common than not for several months. I don\u2019t believe the Lake Erie Ice Dams are an issue like they used to be. Freak shit still happens, some years ago a town north of here got 8 feet of snow overnight. REALLY! Though it was about 60 miles north of me, I had a sunny day. Yeah, shits really weird at this stage. I don\u2019t envy anyone born in the last decade, but they\u2019ll have nothing to compare it with and they\u2019ll have their own normal. But, just look at the photos of glaciers melting, taken from space. It\u2019s damned insane. \n\nThen, there\u2019s the hurricanes. I moved north because of Hurricane Andrew. I lost friends in Florida and decided I no longer wanted to fight that war. Considering what happened with Katrina, I\u2019m relieved I did.\n\nAnyway, my best to you!

        "Ill second this advice. Im in PA, i can catch through the winter but it took some time to find where. I personally have an easier time on the rivers because the comfortable areas are further limited by current- carp are cold blooded, if they dont move they dont have to eat. Food is scarce in the winter so they dont want to move. Eddys behind big rock croppings or jettys, the sunny side of bays, any slow water on the warmer side is great. Bait wise i prefer a harder method mix in the winter bc you can sit on it and fish will bang it around and let you know they are there. They bite wicked light sometimes in the cold and its good to get some feedback to know you are on the right track. Also, warm water discharges are killer. Theres less and less of them these days since the best ones were attached to coal power plants but there used to be a popular one on lake Erie in Ohio. I never made the trip years ago when i travelled a lot for carp, maybe its still there. I used to go to a wwd in Alexandria VA and one in middle PA that were both killer even in the coldest weather but both are gone for a few years now. If you can find groundwater springs those can be hot spots too. Take note of the last spots to freeze in your local waters.

Apparently from the 90s to the mid 00s there was a restoration project to revive the Robinson River,  which is what the stream in Whiteoak Canyon feeds into.  Now i can't find a sampling station at the start of any of the creeks and streams that feed into the river but i did find a watershed analysis of the water in Shenandoah.  The maps in their document have several different kinds of stations that they (the researchers) sampled from.  Also if you search for water sample stations in Shenandoah, you'll get all kinds of links for different kinds of analysis done in the park ranging from discussing water pollution caused by live stock, to suitable pH levels for fish,  monitoring algae blooms, and so on and so forth.  \n\nI don't think it's a pump station, mostly because the water pump stations for hikers are at camp sites and cabins.

The Cuyahoga runs directly through Cleveland and pretty much right on the banks are the steel yards and assorted factories, so they all just used to dump straight into the river. This in turn caused a river that more oozed than flowed and had solid layers of oil and trash on top. That\u2019s what caught fire.\n\nIt got cleaned up and it\u2019s much better now. Its still not a nice river, but fluke oil tanker accidents aside it doesn\u2019t catch fire anymore and you can be next to it without getting sick.\n\nIf I remember correctly the whole third floor of the Great Lakes Science Center (in Cleveland and right on the shore of Lake Erie) is actually about the Great Lakes, the water cycle and the pollution of the Cuyahoga and the effort to clean it up.

I'd brought with me what was probably the cheapest mouse gun available at the time, a Raven Arms .25 Auto and a couple boxes of ammo, just to plink with. At one point we decided it would be kinda cool to visit Canada too, so we got the map out and decided to cross over at Sault Ste. Marie and sight see through to the Canadian side of Niagara Falls, where we'd cross back into the U.S. and drive home along Lake Erie back to Ohio.\n\nSo we pull up to the border station and there's a sign says something like \"take this lane if you have anything to declare.\" Now I didn't know if I needed to \"declare\" this little handgun, but I knew Canadians were kinda funny about guns, so I figured better safe than sorry. I pulled into the designated lane and smiled and told the nice man there I had a handgun packed away in the back and wasn't sure if I needed to mention it. I swear his pasty face paled just a little bit as he directed me to a specific parking area.\n\nThe minute I stopped multiple border agents swarmed the car, ordered the two of us out, and demanded to know where the gun was. \"Well\" I said, \"it's in that backpack in the back seat, unloaded. Seems like this is a big deal to you guys, huh? I mean, you understand *I* told *you* it was there, right? There's nothing nefarious going on here, we're just camping!\"\n\nSo they safely located the dangerous weapon, and then proceeded to pull every last thing we owned out of the car and dump it on the oil-stained pavement to be pawed through.

Explosives? Jimmy Hoffa?? \n\nThey then took us into separate rooms and had us strip so they could paw through the clothes we were wearing too.

This process was *of course* a multi hour, multi-form filled exercise in manufactured difficulty designed by hoplophobic bureaucrats to dissuade people like me from despoiling their frozen Hoser paradise of enforced passivity with my can-plincking-in-the-woods ways! And they were successful. As I walked back to my car with my cheap little gun to drive the long way home from Michigan, I scraped the toxic, benighted queen-worshipping Canadian soil from my feet and vowed never enter their country again, and I never have.\n\nOh Canada, you've got some good things, like your health care system, but your current enthusiasm for becoming disarmed peasants is *exactly* what I would have predicted all those years ago.

        "Building off of what u/undergroundmike said, many older cities have a combined sewer system. This means that at some point down the line, the storm and sanitary sewers are combined into one line leads to a water treatment plant. The treatment plants are designed to be able to handle a certain volume of sanitary sewer waste, but when it rains a lot, there is simply too much volume for the capacity of the treatment plant. Rather than hold the extra water in the sewers and let it back up into the streets and eventually into peoples homes, the sewers have an emergency overflow that dumps into your nearest water body. This is why sometimes the beaches close for unsafe bacteria levels after heavy rains. Lake Erie gets full of poop water. \n\nThese days, new sewers are always kept separated. It is really expensive to separate the old sewers, though. The CSO tunnels are one solution to hold the extra volume until excess capacity is available at the plant. \n\nI\u2019ve been in these tunnels - AMA!",

        "This has been a problem all through out the Great Lakes. I am curious to hear more about your situation, I like to know what's going on farther up the Great Lakes before it gets down to Niagara Falls and Lake Erie. Lake Ontario's shoreline has been up about 5-10 feet higher this year (it's been even higher than that in the past few years, hovering around 20 feet higher). A shit ton of Land along the NY Ontario shoreline has been lost due to the higher water line. It's been wiping out docks/boat houses and creating massive flooding issues everywhere. Lake Erie's level has also been up higher, I know of erosion problems along the shore line of Buffalo and Western New York too.  \n\n\nWhere I live, the lower Niagara river is also up about 5-10 feet higher and some of the landmark rocks below Niagara Falls are no longer visible. I look at the river all day long while I am at work and I have never seen it as high as it has been the past couple of years (been working at the same place for almost 10 years, plus lifelong resident). It has made some of the work my crew does harder (since some areas are submerged deeper than usual and the Falls flow rate is increased). A significant amount of water is diverted away from going over Niagara Falls and into the hydro-electric power plant reservoirs, I can only imagine how much worse the water level would be if we didn't have that ability to control the flow rate and store the excess water for later use. A bit higher up the upper Niagara river, before the the water plunges over the falls and into the Niagara gorge, some neighborhoods located along the river have had flooding problems recently.  \n\n\n Here, there is a big controversial fight about the international treaty, Plan 14, between NY and Canada. The plan basically calls for the more of the water to be contained in Lake Ontario instead of diverted downstream through the Saint Lawerence river/Seaway and along Ontario's watershed, in order to prevent the city of Montreal from getting flooded out. So people in this region have come to believe that the reason why the lake and river levels have been increasing is due to a foreign city (Montreal) can benefit at their expense.  \n\n\nBut that's bullshit in my opinion, because the water level is high every where through out the Great Lakes. It's not just isolated to Lake Ontario and it's not like all that water is getting backed up through the Great Lakes just because of Montreal. I did my final university internship with a local soil and water conservation district (each NY county has a government organization that monitors the county's soil/water health). Every single stream, creak and spring's water level  in the county that we measured was up significantly higher than it has been historically. These streams, creeks and springs are directly flowing into the Niagara river and Lake Ontario. One main reason for the increased water level, is that we are still receiving about the same amount of precipitation through out the year, but the winters have become much more milder and warmer than they usually are historically. So all precipitation isn't getting stored as snow or ice through out the winter and slowly released in the spring/summer. It's just coming right down and melting right away into the watershed. The oxygen and flow rate were also both way up, while the turbidity was down, meaning that the rate of which the water is getting released into the watershed may also be way up high.\n\nSorry for the long comment reply, I just get excited about this kind of stuff and would like to share.",

Cleveland also has a new network of flood storage tunnels under the city that serve the same purpose as Tokyo\u2019s flood storage. \n\nCleveland and most other older cities have separate sanitary and storm sewers, but the overflow channels for these are combined\u2014so whenever we get a heavy rain, storm waters overflow and raw sanitary sewage gets mixed in with the storm water. Cleveland\u2019s sewer plants try to treat the water, but usually the overflow would flood the treatment plants as well, so at that point storm water with raw sewage gets discharged into Lake Erie. One such outlet can be found on the dog beach at Edgewater Park. This is why Lake Erie is unsafe to swim in after a storm\u2014because of the raw sewage discharged. The storage tunnels under the city are intended to hold the overflow water until after the storm, when the treatment plants will have capacity to pump them out and treat all the water. This will make Lake Erie way healthier, and not just to swim in. The phosphorus that feeds toxic algae blooms often comes from raw sewage...and even more from agricultural runoff...which is because they fertilize fields with the equivalent (or actual) of poop from animals.",

Excessive phosphorus use from agriculture and residential use literally killed Lake Erie in the 60's.  \n\nYour lawn really doesn't need much P, so if you alternate an application of milorganite with fertilizers that contain no P you slow down the P buildup and slow down the environmental damage.\n\nP in soil only moves about an inch or two a year, so once your soil has enough P, you shouldn't apply any at all (except maybe a light dash of starter when you're seeding to get some P immediately next to the seedlings).  If you overdo the P, that also means it takes a few years to get levels under control.  \n\nIf you want organic fertilizer, just use one with little to no phosphorus.  If you like the period of dark green from massive iron application like milorganite uses, use ironite or a synthetic with iron added, like Scott's Green Max.\n\nI like milorganite, it's good fertilizer, but it isn't the best one to use on lawns if you've already got enough P.",

        "There is actually good reason for it. Dog poop contains tons of harmful microorganism. When it rains, that poop breaks down, in whole or in part, and washes into the local water systems. If it is just going into the sewers and gets immediately recycled through water purification plants, it isn't as harmful since those plants will do massive cleaning. However, if you live in an area that is a watershed (such as the Great Lakes area), then you end up draining all of those microorganisms into the local water. Not only can this harm the local wildlife, it can also hurt people who use the water systems.\n\nSo, why is it a problem for dogs and not other animals? It ultimately is about what they eat. Dog food tends to be very nutrient rich, which causes their poop to contain high amounts of certain elements, such as phosphorus, which can cause harmful algal blooms. In fact, it was because of fertilizer run-off that there were some extremely serious algal blooms in Lake Erie several years back, which caused many places to be unable to drink the water due to the toxins present. \n\nWildlife doesn't have this problem though because they keep a closed system, for the most part. Deer eat things right in the environment and then return those nutrients to it. Dogs eat food from outside of the environment and then put nutrient dense poop into it.\n\nAs well, this generally applies to cat poop. It is not recommended that cats be allowed to poop outside if possible, one of the many reasons to not let the genocidal bird killers... I mean cute furry things, outside unsupervised. As well, cat poop also contains parasites (T. gondii) as well which, when in the body of an animal they can't complete their life cycle in (e.g. humans), become dangerous.\n\nSo, it really makes a lot of sense to not want our pets' poop to stay in yards.

Destruction of wetlands, land conversion, cattle and fertilizer use all contribute to this issue and can cause complete loss of oxygen and death in the water column. Any community that relies on surface water for their drinking water has to deal with this as eutrophied waters have poisonous cyanotoxins in them. Agricultural pollution like this also has other serious issues,  E. coli and other coliform bacteria can even enter well supply and cause major issues like the [Walkerton outbreak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkerton_E._coli_outbreak) in the agricultural part of Ontario, killing six. Forest loss and field tilling also lead to increased sediment runoff too, which fills tributaries and eventually the endpoints of their rivers with this material, but also the toxic materials which are applied to the soil by people. Metal pollution can be perpetuated in this way. In these ways deforestation and wetlands destruction in Indiana can contribute to a hypoxic dead zone in the [Caribbean sea](https://www.epa.gov/ms-htf/hypoxia-101) or Lake Erie. Further, destruction of wetlands can reduce the buffering potential of watersheds against volume pulses during rain events. Dams become necessary to protect people living along these rivers from flood events (and they might want them for agricultural reasons as well), and obviously [dams can fail](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/michigan-dam-failures-evacuations-flooding-state-of-emergency/).",

There are several examples in the Great Lakes.  \n\nThe red-tailed leafhopper is a rare hemipteran found in small populations in tallgrass prairie ecosystems in the midwest, but there is a thriving relict population of the insect on Manitoulin Island in Lake Superior (where there is no longer any tallgrass prairie).  They got stranded on the island as biomes shifted, but adapted on the island to different food sources.\n\nThere are caribou on Isolated Slate Island in northern Lake Superior, while on the mainland they have generally all migrated up to the arctic, creating an isolated island population.\n\nMost of the unique, endemic species to the Great Lakes islands are plants, which I have to admit I'm not so familiar with.  Pitcher's thistle, lakeside daisy, and dwarf lake iris are examples of flowers found only on certain islands in the Great Lakes.

        "A school district in Beverly Hills, California, was saddled with a bill of at least $11 million to plug 19 oil wells on the property of its high school, after a judge in 2017 absolved Venoco LLC - the bankrupt company that had been operating the wells - of any responsibility for clean-up because other creditors took priority. The city of Beverly Hills is contributing another $11 million to the job.\n\n\u201cThis is an incredible amount of money\u201d siphoned away from education, said Michael Bregy, superintendent of the Beverly Hills Unified School District.\n\nState and federal regulations normally require drillers to pay an up-front bond to cover future cleanups if they go belly-up. But the rules are a patchwork, with wildly differing requirements, and they seldom leave governments adequately funded. In Pennsylvania, for example, it would take several thousand years to plug its estimated backlog of 200,000 abandoned oil wells at the current rate of spending, according to data from the state regulator.\n\nOil-industry lobbyists have been fighting state and federal efforts to increase the bonding, arguing it would hurt jobs and economic growth during an already tough time for the industry.\n\n\u201cStates and the federal government have many sources of funding available to reclaim and plug abandoned wells,\u201d said Reid Porter, a spokesman for the American Petroleum Institute, the country\u2019s largest oil and gas trade group.\nThe API spent $1.44 million in the first quarter of 2020 lobbying on Capitol Hill, with oil well bonding legislation one of the target issues, lobbying disclosures show.\n\nThe U.S. Government Accountability Office estimates that cleaning up and plugging an abandoned well runs from $20,000 to $145,000, **putting the price tag for cleaning up all of America\u2019s abandoned wells somewhere between $60 billion to $435 billion.**\n\n#\u2018SHOOTING OUT OF THE EARTH\u2019\n\n**The pollution threat goes beyond climate change. Leaks from abandoned wells have been found to contaminate groundwater and soil. In extreme cases, gas from abandoned wells has caused explosions.**\n\nIn Ohio and Texas, state regulators have each found an average of around two groundwater contamination incidents per year related to orphaned wells, according to research by the Groundwater Protection Council published in 2011 and dating to the 1980s.\n\nIn April 2017, for example, neighbors of Ohio farmer Stan Brenneman alerted him to the smell of oil coming from a drainage ditch on his 111-acre corn and soybean farm near the town of Elida, Brenneman told Reuters. The ditch drains water from the farm and carries it into rivers, streams and eventually Lake Erie.\n\nOhio\u2019s Division of Oil &amp; Gas Resources Management excavated 800 feet of the farm\u2019s drainage system to find a well casing - about 130 years old - releasing oil three feet underground. The plugging operation took two months to complete and cost the state $196,915, according to a spokeswoman for the state Department of Natural Resources.\n\nMore recently, in 2018, the U.S. EPA was alerted to the presence of nearly 50 abandoned oil and gas wells on Navajo Nation lands within the borders of Utah and New Mexico that were bubbling water at the surface. Tests showed the way from some of the wells contained potentially dangerous levels of arsenic, sulfate, benzene and chloride.\n\nThe Navajo Nation Environmental Protection Agency said plugging the wells would require \u201cmajor funds\u201d and that, in the meantime, the public had been warned not to drink the water.\n\nIn rare cases, gas from long-abandoned wells can cause dangerous accidents.\n\nIn January of last year, a 1930s-era well sent a geyser of gas and dirt 100 feet into the air at the construction site of a Marriott seaside hotel in Marina del Rey, California, an upscale community in the Los Angeles area, according to a state report. The hotel owners did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\u201cIt was horrifying,\u201d said resident Marilyn Wall, who witnessed the explosion from her home across the street. She said she was stunned \u201cby the extent and the length of time that the stuff was shooting out of the earth.\u201d\n\nA worker standing on a construction platform above the plume was sprayed with debris and scrambled to lower himself down with an escape rope, a video of the explosion shows.\n\n#DON\u2019T DRINK THE WATER\n\nFor Hanson and Michael Rowe, their troubles did not end the day their abandoned well was plugged. They no longer drink from the water well on their property because it gives them diarrhea, they said. Michael Rowe said she still suffers from headaches and coughing spells.\n\nKentucky\u2019s Energy and Environment Cabinet is still fighting to recoup the $383,340 cost from the now-defunct J.D. Carty and Blue Energy in an ongoing court battle.\n\nAn attorney for John Carty, founder of J.D. Carty, said his client had sold what few assets remained in the company and therefore bore no responsibility. A lawyer for Blue Energy said the company denies ever operating the wells on the property and has no responsibility to maintain or plug them.\n\nJ.D. Carty was only required to have one $50,000 \u201cblanket bond\u201d to cover all its wells in Kentucky. The amount forfeited to pay for the leaky well on Rowe\u2019s land, determined in part by its depth, was just $2,500 - less than 1% of the cost to fix it.\n\nAfter the incident, Kentucky lawmakers passed a bill last year that effectively doubled bond requirements for shallow wells to help cope with the state\u2019s 13,000 abandoned wells. Still, state regulators say the list of wells is growing.\n\nHanson Rowe said he supports fossil fuel development because using natural gas for heat and cooking has improved his quality of life. But the couple say they hope their lawsuit against the companies involved will help change the way the energy industry manages its wells.\n\n\u201cYou lost your health, you\u2019ve lost it all,\u201d Hanson Rowe said.\n\n#**(I've boldened sections that I feel are particularly noteworthy)**",

Abandoned open pit uranium mines in Wyoming have formed lakes hazardous to wildlife. Uranium-bearing formations are usually associated with strata containing high concentrations of selenium. For example, one of these pits killed 300 birds during a single year (US Fish and Wildlife Service 2008). Presuming this rate stayed constant, deaths at this mine therefore correlate to about 0.45 deaths per GWh.\n&gt;\n&gt;Like fossil-fueled power stations and wind farms, avian fauna can also collide with nuclear power plants. Three thousand birds died in two successive nights in 1982 from collisions with cooling towers at Florida Power Corporation\u2019s Crystal River Generating Facility (Maehr et al. 1983). Given that the power plant now hosts an 838-MW nuclear reactor, and presuming it operated with a capacity factor of 90% and that the 3000 deaths were the only ones throughout the year, the facility was responsible for 0.454 avian deaths per GWh. Ornithologists observed 274 fatal bird collisions with an elevated cooling tower at the Limerick nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania from 1979 to 1980 (Veltri and Klem 2005). Since the Limerick plant has a 1200-MW reactor, and also assuming it operated at a 90% capacity factor, it was responsible for 0.261 deaths per GWh. At the Susquehanna plant in eastern Pennsylvania, 1500 dead birds were collected between 1978 and 1986 for an average of 187 fatalities per year (Biewald 2005). Assuming that the 2200 MW plant operated at 90% capacity factor, it was responsible for 0.01 deaths per GWh. Extensive surveys for dead birds were also conducted at the Davis-Bess nuclear plant near Lake Erie in Northern Ohio. Ornithologists recorded a total of 1554 bird fatalities or an average of 196 per year from 1972 to 1979 (Biewald 2005). Given that the power plant hosts an 873-MW reactor, and assuming it operated with a 90% capacity factor, and the plant was responsible for 0.0285 fatalities per GWh. Taking the mean for each of the four power plants results in 0.188 deaths per GWh. \n&gt;\n&gt;The total avian deaths per GWh for nuclear power plants are therefore about 0.638.",

This growth-limiting nutrient is typically nitrogen or phosphorus, but can also be iron, vitamins, or amino acids.[3] There are several mechanisms for the addition of these nutrients in water. In the open ocean and along coastlines, upwelling from both winds and topographical ocean floor features can draw nutrients to the photic, or sunlit zone of the ocean.[10] Along coastal regions and in freshwater systems, agricultural, city, and sewage runoff can cause algal blooms.[11] Two examples of anthropogenic algal blooms in the United States are in Lake Erie and the Gulf of Mexico.[12]\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plankton\n\n&gt; Phytoplankton absorb energy from the Sun and nutrients from the water to produce their own nourishment or energy. In the process of photosynthesis, phytoplankton release molecular oxygen (O\n2) into the water as a waste byproduct. It is estimated that about 50% of the world's oxygen is produced via phytoplankton photosynthesis.[30] The rest is produced via photosynthesis on land by plants.[30] Furthermore, phytoplankton photosynthesis has controlled the atmospheric CO\n2/O2 balance since the early Precambrian Eon.[31]\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytoplankton\n\n&gt;The effects of anthropogenic ocean acidification on phytoplankton growth and community structure has also received considerable attention. Phytoplankton such as coccolithophores contain calcium carbonate cell walls that are sensitive to ocean acidification. Because of their short generation times, evidence suggests some phytoplankton can adapt to changes in pH induced by increased carbon dioxide on rapid time-scales (months to years)",

At our busiest game, you could see eight people around a big table, 8 2L bottles of Coke, and 7 asthma inhalers (and one pack of smokes, but I took it outside, of course.)  All my friends were actually from out of town, and didn't develop asthma until they moved to Windsor.  Go figure.  (I've quit smoking.  My lungs collapsed while I was being operated on for a holey gut, and they said my lungs were basically utter garbage.  Two weeks on a breather cleaned 'em up real good, though, and a month in the hospital was a great start on The Patch, so I was able to quit, finally.  I also left that polluted shit-hole 20 years ago, and that solved a chronic migraine problem on its own ...)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntldr:  Pollution is just as bad as smoking.",

        "Western New York near Buffalo, right by Lake Erie which is exactly what I'd like to bring up. The lake was at 36\u00b0F today (February 4th) which ties the record for daily temperature. Another alarming note about the lake is as of a few days ago, there was ice coverage totalling 0%. It is getting into mid-winter (or what should/used to be the middle of it) and I can't think of a time in my life that there was a ZERO for the amount of ice coverage. If anything it should be &gt;70% covered, and it wouldn't be abnormal to have it as high as 90%+ (If I can find a current estimate for ice coverage I'll edit this, haven't seen any measurement since this past Friday morning) Either last winter (2019) or the winter prior (2018) the lake was 100% frozen around now, give or take a couple weeks.\n\nIf a cold burst of air ever ends up coming through, coupled with winds out of the southwest, we are going to get HAMMERED with lake effect snow. Because Erie is wide open without any ice, there will be nothing to prevent the moisture from being absorbed from the surface. I'm interested to see if this pattern of freeze&gt;thaw&gt;freeze breaks and we get any \"normal\" winter weather, which would mean the snow on the ground lasts longer than 3 or 4 days. Our yearly snowfall average is 95\"/241cm which we have currently a total of only 40\"/~100cm. We usually don't really see much significant snowfall after March, though snow in April, May and even the beginning of June wouldn't be impossible.\n\nThere are Canadian Geese around here, I don't know when they arrived or where they came from, shit they probably didn't ever leave in the first place. There are squirrels out running around. \n\nI am very grateful that this is all lies and fake news though, and some kind of communist conspiracy or something to collapse the US with climate hysteria like my father seems to believe. Because if it wasn't then it would seem that the jet stream has collapsed or is broken, and that has seriously altered the weather around here atleast.

Trump wants to slash medicare and social security because I guess old people should just pull themselves up by their bootstraps and go get themselves jobs. We've abandoned our allies to the slaughter. We have made zero progress on the nuclear programs of Iran or North Korea (and have probably regressed). Russia continues to meddle in our elections. The economy is the result of Obama's policies, Trump is just riding the coattails (and the economy has slowed since 2016 by several measures). The air and water are more polluted than they've been in years, including the red tide off of Florida's coasts and the algae in Lake Erie. Climate change continues unabated, and our president promotes the myth that it's a Chinese hoax while hurricanes pummel our shores, forest fires continue to rage, and we have floods to the extent that our farmers can't plant OR harvest. We have a woman in the cabinet who literally bought her seat. Lobbyists fill all kinds of positions in government under this administration - so much for draining the swamp. Multiple judges have been appointed who were found to be woefully unqualified by Bar Associations and legal journals, etc. \n\nYou're right, I don't like the leader of our country, my representative face on the international stage, acting like a buffoon and talking about grabbing pussies. I also don't like him starting fights with Gold Star families or disrespecting John McCain by saying he's not a war hero because he was captured. I don't like him accepting a purple heart from a combat wounded veteran with the words \"I always wanted one of these, this was easier.\" I don't like the fact that he dodged the draft. I don't like that he is such a petty little man that he creates insulting nicknames for his adversaries like a five-year-old child. I don't like that he has disallowed members of his staff from testifying before Congress. I especially don't like the fact that he requested a foreign government dig up dirt on a political rival instead of going through the appropriate investigative channels. I really, really don't like that he pushes bullshit conspiracy theories like the Deep State and QAnon. \n\nBut mostly I don't like his policies where the rich get richer and the poor and middle class get fucked.",

        "You may have heard of the Lake Erie Bill of Rights (\u201cLEBOR\u201d), an amendment to Toledo, Ohio\u2019s City Charter that was passed in February 2019. But what is LEBOR? LEBOR is the latest effort within the United States to develop \u201crights of nature\u201d laws, which declare that ecosystems like Lake Erie have their own fundamental rights. Relying on Ohio\u2019s Constitution, LEBOR attempts to declare an immediate emergency within Lake Erie\u2019s ecosystem based largely on Toledo\u2019s concern for its drinking water, which comes from Lake Erie. You may remember that in 2014 the water supply to Toledo had to be shut down due to toxic algae blooms in Lake Erie caused by water pollution.\nLEBOR was intended to permit Toledo, its residents, or Lake Erie itself to enforce the lake\u2019s proclaimed right to exist, flourish, and remain a clean water source through lawsuits and refusing to acknowledge state or federal permits issued to any corporation that would infringe on Lake Erie\u2019s rights. Its primary targets: farms, dairies, and industries with run-off or discharges to Lake Erie, even though these discharges are already regulated by state and federal laws.\nLEBOR is not the first attempt to have the rights of nature recognized in the United States. In 1972, the United States Supreme Court considered whether nature or natural features should have rights, and correspondingly legal standing to enforce those rights, in\u00a0Sierra Club v Morton.1\u00a0The United States Supreme Court held that environmental objects did not have legal standing to sue for their own preservation. Justice William O. Douglass penned the lone dissent, stating that \u201c[c]ontemporary public concern for protecting nature\u2019s ecological equilibrium should lead to the conferral of standing upon environmental objects to sue for their own preservation.\u201d2\nThe day after LEBOR was approved by Toledo voters, an Ohio farm filed a federal lawsuit against Toledo. The State of Ohio joined the lawsuit alongside the farm, challenging LEBOR as both unconstitutional and preempted by state and federal law. Interestingly, a motion was filed by parties aligned with Toledo to permit the Lake Erie Ecosystem itself to participate in the lawsuit. The federal judged denied the motion, holding that Lake Erie lacked capacity to sue because the \u201crights of nature\u201d legal concept is not recognized in the United States.\nWhile the lawsuit is still ongoing, a preliminary injunction was issued stopping Toledo from formally adopting LEBOR as part of its City Charter and forbidding any enforcement actions or lawsuits pursuant to LEBOR until the case is decided. A motion to dismiss the lawsuit has been filed and should be heard in the coming months. In the meantime, other Toledo citizens have also filed a lawsuit against the State of Ohio requesting that LEBOR be found enforceable due to Ohio\u2019s alleged failure to address pollution in Lake Erie.\nWhile LEBOR will likely be struck down, these cases are worth keeping an eye on. Water quality concerns in Lake Erie will remain a hot topic in both Michigan and Ohio, and how to address Lake Erie\u2019s pollution and algae blooms may affect Michigan agri-businesses in the future.\n\nSource: Foster Swift Collins &amp; Smith PC",

        "Here is info on the non-profit that that Rolling Stone chose to omit in their article:\n\n-------------------------------\nThe Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund continues to target communities in Pennsylvania and Ohio for so-called Rights of Nature initiatives aimed at banning fracking and other regulated development activities. Initiatives similar to those that have appeared in Youngstown and the Lake Erie region in Ohio, as well as Grant Township and Potter County, Pa., have been rejected by several courts and voters, and proven costly for taxpayers.\n\nHere\u2019s what Pennsylvania and Ohio residents should know about the group behind the initiatives:\n\n**What is the Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund (CELDF)?**\n\nCELDF is a nonprofit law firm based in Mercersburg, Pa., west of Gettysburg. It offers communities \u201cfree\u201d services to draft local ordinances and provide legal representation for the communities that pass them. Ordinances \u2013 which go by names such as \u201cCommunity Bill of Rights,\u201d \u201cRights of Nature,\u201d \u201cCharter amendments or home rule\u201d initiatives \u2013 often fail or end up in litigation, with the costs for either outcome falling to taxpayers in those communities. CELDF started out fighting \u201cfactory farms\u201d and has since set its sights on the oil and gas industry.\n\n**Who is CELDF?**\n\nFounder and Executive Director Thomas Linzey\u2019s agenda is based on a dismantling of private property rights, as he made clear in a 2015 speech:\n\n&gt; \u201cIf you are going to put all that work into a ballot initiative, why not do a ballot initiative that bans all finance companies in New York City from funding new projects that exasperate climate change? Why not do something real\u2026why not do something real\u2026cause people are saying to themselves, \u2018it would be illegal, it would be unlawful, it would be unconstitutional, because you are taking their property\u2019 well..(expletive), it\u2019s time.\u201d \n\nAdditionally, in 2016 Linzey told audiences in Lancaster that \u201cPennsylvania\u2019s constitution is a weapon for corporations,\u201d and that it\u2019s \u201ctime for a revolt.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s not the only extreme voice in the group. In a 2015 meeting in Youngstown, CELDF National Organizer Ben Price told attendees that \u201cwe\u2019re gonna make decisions in here that the rest of the community will just have to live with \u2026 It\u2019s how it\u2019s done!\u201d\n\nCELDF\u2019s Pennsylvania Community Organizer Chad Nicholson, who hails from Spokane, Washington, has given numerous presentations, including one titled \u201cDefying the Corporate State,\u201d to communities across Pennsylvania.  Nicholson said in 2017:\n\n&gt; \u201cLet\u2019s be clear: our state agencies, tasked with \u2018environmental protection,\u2019 are legalizing harmful activities by issuing permits to corporations with histories of violations. And, they are doing so against the will and sovereign law of the people who live in the community.\u201d\n\nAlso in 2017, Nicholson said that \u201cfrom the very beginning of this country\u2019s founding with our Constitution that was written in 1787,\u201d we \u201cdon\u2019t really have a democracy to begin with, that it\u2019s not just failing.\u201d\n\nCELDF\u2019s Board of Advisors includes Gasland director Josh Fox; Karenna Gore, who is the founding director of the Center for Earth Ethics in New York and Al Gore\u2019s wife; Rainforest Action Network founder Randy Hayes; former Pittsburgh city councilman Doug Shields; and other anti-industry activists.\n\n**CELDF\u2019s record**\n\nCELDF does not have a winning record and its desire to prolong litigation even when it knows it has no chance of winning is well documented.  In 2018, a Pennsylvania federal judge reprimanded CELDF attorneys (including its founder and executive director, Thomas Linzey) for \u201cbad faith\u201d efforts to impose a ban on an injection well in Grant Township, Indiana County. U.S. District Court Judge Susan Baxter ordered the organization to pay $52,000 in legal costs and said in her ruling:\n\n&gt;\u201cThis Court has determined that Attorneys Linzey and Dunne have pursued certain claims and defenses in bad faith. Based upon prior CELDF litigation, each was on notice of the legal implausibility of the arguments previously advanced\u2026\u201d\n\n&gt; \u201cDespite their own prior litigation, CELDF and Attorney Linzey, in particular, continue to advance discredited arguments as a basis for CELDF\u2019s ill-conceived and sponsored CBR, and in doing so have vexatiously multiplied the litigation of this matter.\u201d \n\nCELDF focuses on using litigation to drive conversation, regardless of the cost that these irresponsible cases can bring on municipalities and taxpayers. When asked about CELDF\u2019s ultimate motivation, Reuters reported:\n\n&gt; \u201cLinzey says his goal is not to write local laws that are popular, or stand up in court, but rather to trigger a public debate about community rights to local self-government \u2013 even if it means a community ultimately falls into financial ruin.\u201d\n\n**Who pays for CELDF initiatives and legal costs?**\n\nCELDF\u2019s failed initiatives have already cost taxpayers in places such as Youngstown tens of thousands of dollars. Voters in the city recently rejected a CELDF ballot initiative for the eighth time. The costs to taxpayers doesn\u2019t appear to bother Linzey, who said,\n\n&gt;\u201cIf a town goes bankrupt trying to defend one of our ordinances, well, perhaps that\u2019s exactly what is needed to trigger a national movement.\u201d \n\n**Who funds CELDF?**\n\nHow can CELDF afford such repeated failure? It\u2019s funded through foundations and private donations. They include the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, Heinz Endowments, Wallace Global Fund and others that actively support anti-fracking and anti-industry groups and initiatives.\n\n**What is a \u201crights of nature\u201d initiative?**\n\nLinzey explained the organization\u2019s \u201crights of nature\u201d movement as:\n\n&gt;\u201cWhat is increasingly growing is a realization that for a real environmental movement to occur, ecosystems must have legally enforceable rights of their own.\u201d \n\nCELDF has not been successful defending \u201crights of nature\u201d initiatives in Pennsylvania. Most recently, following CELDF\u2019s attempt to intervene in a lawsuit on behalf of the ecosystem, Judge Baxter ruled:\n\n&gt;\u201cAs to the issue of whether the Little Mahoning Watershed, an ecosystem, has standing under the law, no determination need be made here. Clear and convincing evidence has not been produced to show that [the township\u2019s] vigorous defense of the Ordinance, the terms of which protect the Watershed in all of its locations, do not line up precisely.\u201d \n\nBaxter also explained,\n\n&gt;\u201cAlthough defendant wishes it were not so, the development of oil and gas (which necessarily includes the management of waste materials generated at a well site) is a legitimate business activity and land use within Pennsylvania.\n\n&gt; \u2026\n\n&gt;\u201cThere is no state authority expressly granting a municipal government or its people the authority to regulate the depositing of waste from oil and gas wells or to invalidate permits granted by the state or federal government. Any provision enacted without underlying legislative authority is invalid and unenforceable.\u201d\n\nAs recent years have demonstrated, CELDF will continue to advance its unlawful and unconstitutional agenda so long as wealthy foundations that fund the \u201cKeep It In the Ground\u201d agenda continue to provide the means for it to do so. And given CELDF\u2019s dismal track record, taxpayers will continue to foot the bill for this folly.",

Thus there are pockets of poverty and crime scattered throughout the city which don't exist in Roanoke.  (yes there are small areas of poverty in ROA, but not the miles of boarded up housing war zones I've experienced in rust belt cities up north.)\n\nAs far as the climate goes, there is no comparison.  West of  Buffalo, when Lake Erie experiences sunlight and evaporates, the evaporated lake water turns to snow and dumps itself onto shores and land east of Lake Erie (and Lake Ontario).  This can lead to a seemingly endless pummeling of snowfall for weeks and months.  I lived in Cleveland for 44 years, and it's what drove me out of the city (not to mention the increasing levels of poverty and crime) and it's probably what will badger you for the rest of your stay in Buffalo if you decide to live there. One particular winter the high temperature did not go above 29 degrees for 40 straight days, all with six to fourteen inches of snow.\n\nFurthermore, Roanoke is incredible!

We have taken a page from Disneyland and tried placing our cans in closer proximity to each other AND in locations where people will likely have trash with them (e.g outside of restaurants, picnic areas, etc.). The problem is the cost of maintenance. All of those cans have to be emptied at least once a week, and the cost of installing them can be pricey (we once got a quote for 10 cans at 10k). So while adding more cans is the best, figuring out placement of what you have is a great BMP. \n\nYou should give data driven results of litter reduction when cans are repurposed in new locations and the area of effect for each can (a little markers around the can on a map to show trash is reduced within this area).\n\nAlso I would add pet waste in your study for litter. Many agencies will have to come into compliance with F.coli TMDLs for their watersheds.

The organizers had to do this  for a specific reason dealing with the Clean Water Act.  The area is in or around a couple of different properties from private, local, and state.  The encampments were getting pushed from one property to the next.  The organizers could not get people to work together.  So (long story short) the trash survey was done to show that the TMDL of trash was exceeding the CWA.  Lo and behold city put resources into coordinating and cleaning the area.  They didnt see the light but felt the heat  but it worked.  Those needing help were offered the resources.  Those that didn't had to move on.  Then efforts were focused on clearing non native arrundo dorax (giant reed) and native restoration.   The arrundo gave the criminal and tweaker populations great cover.  With its removal the bike thieves move on.  But it started with the survey and CWA enforcement.  This was a novel approach but it could easily be done in any other city where bureaucracy and red tape hinders needed clean up.  Homeless isnt a fun topic that politicians want to tackle.

On very windy days the waves can be six or eight feet high (I've heard reports of them being twice that, depending on what the bottom is like in the area).

It's completely gorgeous.\n\n*Edit*: It's kayakable maybe half the year (south shore of Lake Erie), though for a couple of those months you'll need cold water gear to be safe. For three or four months of the year it's warm and amazing. I go out in shorts and a t-shirt, with my PFD when it's not like a glass mirror (otherwise, PFD strapped to the deck in arm's reach). During the summer months my challenge is to avoid sunburn and heat stroke. And when it's cold, it's really fucking cold. The beaches are still beautiful, if you're bundled up. The ice isn't some pretty sheet of white stretching to the horizon; because of pressure from farther out in the lake, what used to be our water turns into something like Superman's Fortress of Solitude: big, angular, jagged slabs of ice sticking up at odd angles, for miles and miles.\n\nYes, unregulated dumping is still a problem despite decades of cleanup and regulation efforts. It's generally safe to swim where I live, though this is partly (I've been told) because of invasive species like Zebra Mussels which filter the water so aggressively that they endanger native fish and plants. \n\nCleaning up industrial, city, and farm pollution is an ongoing battle (but progressing, thank you, and much, much better than a couple of decades ago), but one of the worst pollution issues in freshwater lakes in North America, including all the Great  Lakes, is microplastics.

        "I beg to differ sir. I\u2019ve been a hunter, fisherman, and gardener since I was a little boy. Sometimes you go out and come back with hardly nothing, but for a skilled woodsman such as myself (not to brag), those days are few and far between. The days that happens are outweighed by the days you come back with a large game animal or a pile of fish. Take this morning for example, I went fishing for about 5 or 6 hours and came home with 4 catfish, 3 drum, and a perch. That\u2019s more than I can personally eat in one sitting by a lot, so if I was living off what I was able to collect from nature and nothing more I\u2019d have had a surplus of food. When I do the math I made the calories I spent today back in an hour of fishing so I\u2019d have had a lot of extra fish to smoke and keep for later. That\u2019s fishing completely legally with my limit of 2 lines attached to 2 fishing rods at a time with a maximum of 2 hooks per line. No nets, no funnel traps, no trotlines or setlines, no shooting carp with my bow, nothing besides my legal limit of 2 fishing rods per fisherman in our polluted overfished waters of the modern era. Imagine if I could break the law and set a gill net or a trotline out. Imagine if I could shoot the passing ducks and geese and buzzards. Imagine if I could trap the woodchuck and the mink around the area. That\u2019s just a public Lake Erie water access point with hundreds of boats going by per day and charter fisherman ripping up the fish populations. \n\n\nIt\u2019s hard to make ones living off the land, but it is natural. I find my job much more degrading than sitting on the side of the lake or \u201csurvival camping\u201d with my buddy where we go out and only eat wild foods for a set period of time. I could do that shit every day. \n\n\nFrom my small, 1/8th of an acre garden I have been able to yield so far probobly 20 pounds of beans as well as some young diakon long radishes, I\u2019d guess about 8 pounds of them. Imagine if I had all the time in the day to make that garden bigger with hand tools. Between fishing legally and gardening legally I could reasonably sustain myself. I\u2019d harvest surpluses of fish when I could and smoke it to preserve it long term and sun dry vegetables I grow. Imagine if our earth wasn\u2019t god knows how many degrees hotter than it\u2019s supposed to be and the big Lake Erie actually still froze enough for icefishing. If that was the case I could reasonably feed myself off just fishing and gardening legally. I plan to return to wild nature one day, Michigan\u2019s UP or Alaska, near the Innoko River. The laws won\u2019t effect me when I do that. How do you think I\u2019d be able to do? I\u2019d venture to say I\u2019d be eating pretty well",

I think one way that would help people really wake up to the idea of climate change are simple stories like this. \u201cHow things aren\u2019t like they use to be\u201d and how thats not just a storytelling trope. I\u2019m from the midwestern US and we use to get mild winters. Would often get as cold as -5C but not far past that in base temperature. Living near Lake Erie the windchill usually made it feel colder.  However growing up the big difference came when school was canceled for different reasons. When I was younger it was because of the amount of snow we got, I remember measuring a snow drift in my yard as 1.2 meters. There would be so much snow the school buses could leave the parking lot and without transportation schools had to call off. More recently however we have been hit with Polar Vortexes starting around 2012 or 2013. Base temperatures reached -35C with windchills making it feel even colder. So either it was way to cold for engines to start or it was too cruel to ask children to wait for a bus in that kind of cold. Having a snow day as a kid but not being able to go outside is probably the weirdest part. We\u2019re going to keep getting these Vortexes every winter from what I can see and its sad because winter was a very special time for me growing up but now it seems to be changing for the worst.",

They conflate \"weather\" and \"climate\" as it suits them.  In fairness, layman climate change advocates also sometimes make the same mistake in blaming a particular heat wave on climate change.  The shift to \"climate change\" does better describe the effects of global warming, which go beyond simply \"it's more hot\".  \n\n\nOne example I read was that in 2006, for the first time in recorded history Lake Erie didn't freeze.  That ended up resulting in GREATER lake-effect snow than usual because there was more moisture in the air.  I'm not saying that proves climate change, but it's just a possible example of the sort of consequence that CAN result that might not be as clear to describe as \"global warming\".   \n\n\nI fucking hate the \"the climate changes naturally so we shouldn't do anything\" argument.  It's in bad faith.  It's like saying that the fucking Vancouver teen couldn't have started the Eagle Creek fire because forest fires happen naturally all the time.

In addition, large quantities of black heavy oil floating in slicks, sometimes several inches thick, are observed frequently. Debris and trash are commonly caught up in these slicks forming an unsightly floating mess. Anaerobic action is common as the dissolved oxygen is seldom above a fraction of a part per million. The discharge of cooling water increases the temperature by 10 to 15 \u00b0F / 5.6 to 8.3 \u00b0C. The velocity is negligible, and sludge accumulates on the bottom. Animal life does not exist.

It's easily got the potential to provide all the storage we need, it just needs some investment to make it happen. And once the demand and requirement for storage is there, I think the investment will quickly follow.\n\nLake Erie is already the biggest pumped storage reservoir in the world, but we only use the tiniest sliver of its actual capacity because there's no need for more, at least no need that anyone is willing to throw money at and there's a big tourist attraction in the way. The normal, natural variation range of Lake Erie's water level represents about 11 Terawatt-hours of stored energy. Enough capacity to power the entire world for over 6 months, without even pushing the lake beyond its normal shorelines, high or low. The generation and pumping capacity you would need would be enormous, but the physical capacity in the reservoir is easily available. The energy is being stored and released whether we choose to take advantage of it or not. Niagara Falls eats more hydroelectric energy every day than the entire world uses. It is certainly beautiful, and historically significant, but is it worth destroying the rest of the planet simply to avoid more completely harnessing that monster?\n\nAnd that's just one of the lowest hanging fruit that I can think of.

There\u2019s a continental divide in Akron that turns the river north where it empties into Lake Erie; yes, it\u2019s the one that caught fire. There are horseback riding trails, mountain biking trails and the towpath trail. \n\nYes, the OHIO &amp; Erie Canal went through here and parts of the trails follow that path. The flood of 1913 ended the canal; however, the floods were due to storms that crossed the entire Midwest and ruined many communities. \n\nIn Akron there is a marked path along the street called Portage Path; 50 bronze arrowheads mark the actual trail. In the Valley there\u2019s a huge bronze Indian statue where they pulled their canoes out to portage them 8 miles to the Portage Lakes where they could get to the Tuscawarus River and eventually the Ohio. \n\nStan Hywet is along Portage Path in Akron. It was built in 1913-15 by the Seiberling family who founded Goodyear. 65,000 sq ft mansion with 28 fireplaces, indoor swimming pool, fantastic gardens, birch allee and glass conservatory. The pipe organ in the music room has pipes that are 3 stories tall. It opens April 1 each year. Seiberling\u2019s grandson helped create Cuyahoga Valley National Park. \n\nIf you go into downtown Akron, Lock 3 has a Children\u2019s Museum and ice skating in the winter; concerts in the summer. If you go on the trail behind the Rubber Ducks baseball stadium there is an outline of a towpath barge that is outlined in metal. It gives a great idea of what travel was like. \n\nSummit Metro Parks co-manages some of the trails like Deep Lock Quarry. It\u2019s where they got a lot of the stone for the locks. The Mustill Store is in Akron and along the Towpath Trail. It\u2019s one of the earliest stores still around. \n\nThe Conservancy for Cuyahoga Valley National Park partners with the National Park and provides lots of great programming. They\u2019ve helped fund a new visitors center soon to be open. W\nHen government shutdowns occur, programming still happens through the Conservancy. \n\nBoston Mills is a small town in the middle of the National Park.

Which is why individualist solutions are not going to be effective. \n\nIf a person volunteers to go Green. Then they are a free rider trying to solve the problem of global warming, which is a tragedy of the commons. Going green is the social martyrdom of the people who's work indirectly supports those who refuse to solve the problem. Such that by doing nothing you are better of than people who are doing something as long as someone is doing something. So it would be more economical for individuals to do nothing and let others pay for the cost. \n\nThis is why we tax pollution. Because global warming is an externality and all costs must be paid eventually. The discussion of individual accountability is pointless. We need enforcement to ensure that we don't rely upon free riders, and to limit damage done through the tragedy of the commons exploiting them. It is not an individualist problem, it's not even limited to a single nation either. It's a global crisis. Right now nations are playing a game of brinkmanship with the future of the world because few nations want to be a free rider. \n\nAn excellent example of the problem is the history of the Great Lakes and pollution. To which the largest sources of fresh water in the world has been polluted to the point of making lake Erie and Michigan dying seas. The lakes were free places to dump waste. With just a small amount of waste there was no problem and no need to enforce anything. However over time there were more and more sources of pollution. Too many for the lakes to manage for us all for free. If we let keeping the lakes alive be voluntary, then they would be dead by now because that situation was what allowed the problem to develop and not resolve itself in the first place. Even now they aren't doing that much better off about 50 years after Nixon, but at least they aren't entirely dead. \n\nMy argument is that enforced action is required and that's all that will be effective. Voluntary action is going to be ineffective. Because at this point in this problem there are too many individuals exploiting the free ride of the earth's temperature management.",

So the average prevailing wind has at least 45 miles of fetch to push water into the shallows of the Cleveland area. You may get 20 foot swells in an ocean but with 100'-200' between 'em.  When the wind pipes up on Erie, you can have 6'-8' swells with 12'-20' between 'em.   The difference is wavelength and frequency dictated by the depth of the water.   The ocean may give you a gentle feeling of floating up on on a wave, into the trough, then up on the other side in a very smooth motion. Lake Erie though can be like being in a washing machine.  I cringe seeing open jon boats 4 miles off shore, no life jackets, bouncing up and down on the waves.  One errant wave and the boat will flip (I think most have flotation compartments, but still).\n\nAs for recreational boater traffic, though it's a lot of fun on Labor Day (Air Show) and July 4th fireworks on the lake, the drunk to sober ratio peaks during those times and boat traffic can get nuts.

Then ride a little bit more and take a break to sit down and talk on a bench or wherever (i had a grassy incline along the bike path id always love to stop and sit at and look at the city skyline). Then ride home, give her a hug or kiss goodnight. Excellent date. I highly recommend.

They make it seem as if a pollutant is always some form of a dangerous chemical. \n\nI didn't get that impression, but I also studied environmental science and the CWA specifically and understand how impactful pollutants like excess sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorus are to aquatic ecosystems. \n\n&gt;Most pollutants that end up falling under the term are gravel, rocks, dirt, sand, or other sediment that are adjacent to the \u201cwater way\u201d anyway. Certain rock and gravel is often used for land loss prevention as a protection for further erosion. \n\nJust because they are useful in some areas doesn't mean they aren't incredibly harmful in other areas. Wetlands aren't high erosion zones like river banks or shorelines, and the deposition of sediment will fill in wetlands over time and smother plants. Remediation for this is *insanely* expensive and is often too little too late. The is a reason that the watersheds for the Chesapeake Bay all have TMDLs for sediment: it is a pollutant of major concern even if it won't directly make you sick. Other \"not scary chemicals\" like excess nutrients are extremely disruptive and damaging for aquatic ecosystems like wetlands.\n\nSo it's true that \"pollutant\" doesn't necessarily refer to things like lead but that doesn't mean that we shouldn't be concerned about the impact the changes will have on wetlands.\n\n&gt;There are contaminated and polluted \u201cwetlands\u201d across the US that are waiting to be remediated, but the landowners either can\u2019t secure the proper permit from the Army Corp of Engineers or have to spend millions of additional dollars to appease the ACE\u2019s and EPA\u2019s supervision requirements and clean up specifications.  \n\nWhat landowners are trying to spend tens to hundreds of thousands remediating wetlands but being stopped by regulations? Even if that is a problem, there are other ways to go about addressing it than rolling back protections like this.

For example, Michigan decides to just dump everything and anything into the Detroit River/Lake Erie.  Michigan doesn't care, they only have a small portion of Lake Erie in their border.  But Ohio, PA, NY, and Ontario do care because this affects their fishing and tourism economies.

You may also feel that the executive should not have the power to solely enact federal environmental regulation.  I agree, but since Congress has steadily been giving up their power to the executive over the last century, you have to work with what you got.  I would love if Congress took back from power from the executive, but given the train wreck that is DC, I doubt that will happen anytime soon. \n\nSince environmental standards are extremely important, and impacts the economy, well-being, and general welfare of all people and States, it must be the role of the federal government to set a standard, and the states may enforce a higher standard per the 10th amendment.",

In regions without that, water would be \"clean\" barring mineral contamination, which would be a thing even without agriculture and such\n\n2) Once the Industrial Revolution rolled around, industry polluting water sources is also a thing. You can't drink from Lake Erie because uncountable amounts of factories, industries and even runoff from streets and the like runs into it.\n\n3) Then there are microbial sources that, while they won't kill you, can make you ill if you aren't used to them. \"Montezuma's Revenge\", for example. The water is \"safe to drink\", but since your body isn't used to it, you get sick\n\nWhat does this have to do with your question?\n\nKeep in mind that in many, if not most cases, including \"modern wilderness survival\", if you are dying of dehydration and dont have a way to purify water...... just drink the water.

        "Cool, that sounds like a fun class. Anyway, I'd recommend not thinking about it as a veganism = bad for the environment carnivore = good, because its not that simple. If people want to do what is best for the environment then that is going to mean buying local as that will minimize the amount of energy required to get that food from the farm to your plate. \n\nThe thing is that its very hard to do a vegan diet by just eating locally grown plants, especially for certain parts of the year. \n\nIn addition to the energy required to farm, there is also the problem of run-off from fertilizer on farms that can harm the ecosystem. For example Lake Erie has been dealing with this problem lately. The rain comes and washes the fertilizer and such into the water system which goes into lake erie, lake erie then has a boom of nitrogen which causes a spike in the algae population which makes the water toxic to a lot of the native species and can make the water undrinkable. Specifically this year Toledo's water was not drinkable for a period of time. \n\nNow that is a problem with farming practices in general, not with a vegan diet in particular. A lot of plants grown in the US go to animal feed or to energy production, especially most of the corn in the midwest. \n\nDo what you will but I'd focus on making the argument that the vegan philosophy places minimizing animal suffering above human health and environmental health. And then make the argument that minimizing animal suffering and improving environmental health are at times at odds with each other, enter arguments for ruminant animals on pastures helping trap carbon in the soil and whatnot. If you really want to go after veganism. \n\nBut as I said before, as for the environment its about buying local. But [according to this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/13/dining/fruit-vegetables-imports.html) over half of fruit and a third of vegetables come from outside the US. The article also states that over 80% of seafood is imported. Based on this, its going to be hard to just luck into a vegan diet that doesn't involve shipping produce from around the world just to feed them.",

If I had known that was one of the main career paths I'd be able to have then I would have chosen a different major in college. I never met a single other geologist who actually liked the work, other than the few who were all about the business side of things and becoming a Sr VP. Not saying there's no geo's who actually like it but I never met one. I just never wanted to do \"dirty water\" work; investigating and remediating contaminated sites. I was always more into natural resource stuff, so I busted my ass and made a career pivot to doing just that for a county transportation department. I deal with landslides, flooding, fish passage, removal/fill in water of the US/state, beaver issues, hydrology, invasive plants, storm water/NPDES compliance, TMDLs, erosion issues, permitting for large transportation projects, and whatever other environmental issues come up. I do something different every day. Don't have to worry about being billable or timesheets. Have a pension and retirement account. Plenty of sick and vacation days. Can work just 40 or as much overtime as I want. It took a long time and a lot of hard work but I'm finally doing something that doesn't make me regret getting into geology and environmental science.

But they need a second option, or maybe they need a waypoint between locations.  \n\nOr perhaps they need an area that is between 1800 to 2000 feet above sea level, and an area with a variety of farms both vegetable and animal from with one may choose to barter with, and also wild life again both plant animal and fungi, then perhaps it will make sense. Not to mention some dangerous roads during inclement weather\n\nAs for the close to \u201clarge population centers,\u201d lol I love that phrase, most preppers don\u2019t got the funds to prep, therefore they need those large population centers to keep their jobs, while considering that they need a bug out location that is within 200 to 300 miles from that city center, because that\u2019s the average mileage per tank of \u201cfuel\u201d in every vehicle in America, but who fills up their tanks anyways right. \n\nSo considering the natural resources, distance from the interstate, and major roadways, inaccessibility of certain areas, mountain passes, and farmers- \u2018Mercia loves us our farmers, cause most of us have not got a single green thumb in our body much less our families. \n\nSo yes your theory is extremely feasibly, but that doesn\u2019t deny the fact that people still live in New York State, oh and by the way, considering that every state has a lock down procedure for their borders currently, well my theory is a feasible one also.",

We pppsaw tapes of people already starving by the millions in India, and China was worse. Soon the whole world could be starving as the population reached unsustainable numbers. Civilization itself would collapse before the year 2000 as starving immigrants flooded the first world countries.\n\nPollution in the US was as bad as China today. Lead was thick in the air and contaminated rivers were catching on fire. In 1970, the great Lake Erie was declared dead, void of all life due to pollution.\n\nNot as bad as the 1966 headline of the prestigious Time Magazine asking a very religious nation in a hopeless time, \u201cIs God Dead\u201d?\n\nThe Ozone hole was in there somewhere, at point X it would kill us all.\n\nNot a lot of assassinations today, but:\n\nA President was shot in 1963, Malcom X in 65, Kennedy and MLK in 1968. Multiple riots burned big inner cities to the ground and the political wars made today look like a pillow fight.\n\nThe 1970\u2019s economy was a cluster. Inflation over 10%, mortgages higher than 15%, no chance we were ever going to have it as easy as out parents. The President had a serious speech and said the country was in a malaise.\n\nIn 1977 I learned the World was going to completely run out of oil by the year 2000. No tractors gas to feed the starving in America , no cars, no 18 wheelers to distribute food. In the real world gasoline lines were over 2 hours long.

If you have been with multiple people you are possibly already infected. Being diagnosed was a certain death sentence, and like we hear with Coronavirus, when critical mass is hit in the heterosexual community we will run out of people, care facilities and body bags to comfort and bury the dying.\n\nThe Y2K predictions were from disaster to apocalyptic.\n\nYou get my drift. Coronavirus is real. Climate change is real, but we have been crawling under the desk waiting for the bomb to fall since the first day we can remember.\n\nHere are some really smart English baby boomers as 13 year olds in 1966 predicting the future of the year 2000. \n\nThey make Greta Thunberg sound optimistic.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/cwHib5wYEj8",

        "The Legend of Hell\u2019s Gates\n\nThe area of Lake Erie from Long Point to close to Port Stanley, Ontario,  holds many dark tales.  During the War of 1812, American raiders came from all directions to pillage, burn and loot.  From the Grand River to Point Pelee they left a deep psychological impact on the people and the land, so much so that even today no major Canadian city exists on the north shore of Lake Erie, in direct contrast to the large American cities on the south shore of the Lake.\n\n\tOne grim lake tale plays out around a thickly tree-lined country lane near \u201cSaulter\u2019s Gulley\u201d which runs off the Nova Scotia Line between Port Bruce and Port Burwell, beside the pioneer cemetery of Grovesend. The lane ran down to the high cliffs overlooking Lake Erie.  Halfway down the lane one can still see the mysterious 1870's \u201ctraffic circle\u201d.  At the end of the lane, perched a mansion close to the cliff edge a little past two huge stone gates. These gates would become commonly called \u201cHell\u2019s Gates\u201d; they were \u201cThe Entrance to Hell\u201d because so many who dared go through them would disappear, never to be seen again.  With time and erosion, the mansion crumbled into the lake, leaving only the gates  which stood for many years, until more time and more erosion claimed them, too.\n\n\tFor many years I talked to locals and heard several versions of this story, an though they vary from person to person, the basic elements stayed true.   However the origin of the intense fear of the place took me many years to track down, and the answer came from an older man who wished to remain anonymous.   While I can never prove conclusively what I am to tell you, I personally feel satisfied with the origin of \u201cHell\u2019 Gates\u201d.\n\n\tAround the crumbling mansion and the Gates grew a local Unrequited Love and Ghost story which itself gave way to many versions, depending on who was doing the story telling.  The basic \u201cstory\u201d is, I believe, is founded on an actual 1870's conflict within a local  church congregation resulting in  a bitter split among its members.  The Split was solved when the church burned; some of the day called it arson. Two new churches were built to accommodate the arguing factions, one on the original site with its original graveyard, a new one on a new site with a new graveyard.  Although one of the churches are gone, the cemeteries still exist, but for historical note, neither of these two cemeteries are the Grovesend cemetery. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\t Also divided were the families of the original congregation, two in particular.  A young woman from one group and a young man from the other group were in love. She was forbidden to see him again.  (1)With broken heart, she flung herself off the cliff near the mansion, to her death.  Or (2) She was killed by the jilted lover she was forced to leave.  The motive for her death is also subject to debate,  some local folklore  claiming she was in a \u201cfamily way.\u201d  She was, factually,  laid to rest in neither of the newer cemeteries but the original pioneer cemetery beside Saulter\u2019s Gully/ Grovesend, which, to this day, according to continuing reports, she haunts, wandering in sorrow.  \n\n\tOthers say it\u2019s not her sobbing from the cemetery that they hear, but her lover moaning deep into the night as he  trods up and down along Saulter\u2019s Gully, just as he did in life, in the dark of the night so as not to be seen, long into his old age, his guilt bearing down on him both in life and since, in death.   The fact that she was not buried in either of the newer church operated cemeteries, or what could be seen as \u201challowed ground\u201d  lends support that some something terrible happened and this was far from a natural death.\n\nToday the long lane to the cliff edge where the mansion once stood is blocked by a wide gate and a large \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d sign which is kept in good repair.\n\n\tDuring the American Prohibition years, circa 1920-1933, this Unrequited Love/Ghost story was given a different twist and took on a new life.  Added to the mournful lovers haunting Saulter\u2019s Gulley was a ghostly apparition whose face could be seen in the bark of a large trees near the mysterious \u201ctraffic circle\u201d halfway down the lane. The description of this \u201cghost\u201d resembles the \u201cGreen Man\u201d of pagan Celtic deity,  tradition possibly repeated by the first Scottish settlers who pioneered here circa 1803.  It was said that, should one venture down the lane one would see the ghostly face in the tree and, if it smiled one could continue unharmed, but, if it frowned, something terribly lay ahead.\n\n\tTen years of conflicting research of these stories came to a partial realistic end when, some years ago, I met an elderly gentleman who, as a young child, had spent time in the old mansion and  had seen \u201cthe goings on\u201d.  During the Prohibition years, he said, the mansion was a major meeting and transfer site for smuggling Canadian liquor across Lake Erie into the U.S.  \n\n\tAnother part of this \u201cghost story\u201d survives today on the internet is the \u201cLake Erie Triangle\u201d, modeled after the famed \u201cBermuda Triangle\u201d, which covers roughly Erie, PA to Cleveland, OH up to the north shore of lake Erie, ranging from Port Stanley to Long Point, depending on whom you talk to.  The area of lake Erie just off Erie, PA itself is sometimes referred to as \u201cThe Graveyard of Lake Erie\u201d because of the many shipwrecks in that area over the years. Factually there has been periods of mysterious disappearances of small boats and ships over the years, but after talking some time ago to members of the Eire County Historical Society, they point out that many of the \u201cstrange disappearances\u201d happened during Prohibition years  and that Erie, PA was a major port for incoming Canadian bootleg liquor.   The gentleman who told me the original story backed that point up.  According to him, violence was not uncommon on water or land, either side of the lake.\n\n\tSo it came to be the bootleggers and smugglers of the time either knew or learned of this old ghost story and adapted it to help scare off the curious.  But the original story itself wasn\u2019t always enough, it had to be supplemented by something more sinister - thus, The Face in the Tree.  This was, of course, the constant look-out who was hidden in the trees at the old \u201ctraffic circle\u201d in lane.  When I asked if the lookout was to watch for the authorities, the old gentleman scoffed at me and said bootleggers had those folks well paid off, \u201cAnd besides\u201d he snorted, \u201cWe had bigger guns than them.  It was the other gangs who were the real danger.\u201d   \n\n\tSo I asked the old man \u201cWhat was the something terrible that awaited down the lane if the face frowned instead of smiled at you?\u201d  \u201cWell\u201d, he said, \u201clet me put it this way; Lake Erie is a big place to try to find a person\u201d.\n\n\tA good historian should be able to document and prove their thesis, however for obvious reasons, this is one I will never be able to do so.  The reader is to make up their own mind.   What is most interesting is how an original legend and bit of local folklore changed and expanded over time, either by happenstance or determined effort,  because it served a practical need.    Two distinct  events linked only by physical location yet bound inseparably by all those who still tell the story.  My whole main issue is this then: How many other stories, legend, myths and tales are there told today that may have gone through some similar metamorphosis in the past?   For any historical investigator who uses old folklore as a research tool, keeping this thought in mind may prove useful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\tI will close with two footnotes to ponder.   First, consider that the entire north shore of lake Eire was a major entry port for fleeing refugee slaves during the time of the Underground Railroad.  Sometimes when I talk to the  decedents of  mixed race families in our area I  encounter stories about the  difficult  issues these  relationships caused at the time, tales that are  not at all dissimilar from our original legend.   If we think of the preponderance of black settlers in this area and time frame, is there be another part of history waiting  to be discovered?   Secondly,  I noticed when researching this legend, a  genuine nervousness upon the part of some local  people in telling this story, while  others simply \u201cknew nothing\u201d and walked away.   According to some people I know and knew in law enforcement, smuggling across lake Erie is still an issue today.  Canadian marijuana down, American handguns back up, but like Prohibition,  how does one factually document  stories of the current  black market?   However my point is, could present day conditions be both keeping the old  legend alive and even evolving somehow?  Perhaps in a hundred years, another story teller will answer that question.",

        "&gt;The Morris County Board of Freeholders and Assemblyman Anthony Bucco have authorized an expanded street sweeping and storm drain inspection and cleaning project on county roads around Lake Hopatcong. This is part of a coordinated effort with towns to improve Lake Hopatcong\u2019s health. Lake Hopatcong has been closed to swimming for more than a month because of a series of algae blooms. Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey Sierra Club, released the following statement:\n\n&gt;\u201cThis is just a PR stunt to make it look like they\u2019re doing something when they\u2019ve been doing nothing. More street sweeping and storm drain inspects are too little too late. They should have been doing them all along. After all these years Assemblyman Bucco has been involved in Lake Hopatcong he has not done anything real to protect the lake. Now he\u2019s issuing press releases about cleaning up streets. He should be pushing for a stormwater management plan for the lake, to bring back Septic Management Districts and expand stream buffers. We need more funding for restoration projects for wetlands and natural systems, and to retrofit stormwater systems in existing developments. We must also fix our aging infrastructure and reduce nutrients from failed septics, leaky sewers and combined sewer overflows.\n\n&gt;\u201cLake Hopatcong has been closed to swimming for more than a month because of toxic algae. The algae can cause severe skin rashes and other illnesses. Recent tests showed the algae count increasing in many areas of Lake Hopatcong. We could reach a point where the lake itself collapses. Bucco\u2019s issuing press releases about sweeping streets because he wants to sweep these problems under a rug. Lake Hopatcong\u2019s crisis is a direct result of the state\u2019s failure to properly protect our waterways. They have no watershed management programs. They have not addressed stormwater management and failed septics. They\u2019ve done nothing with nutrient loads and Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) to limit pollutants. They have not controlled overdevelopment.\n\n&gt;\u201cAssemblyman Bucco bears some of the responsibility for Lake Hopatcong\u2019s problems. He voted against the Highlands Act, and opposed Stormwater Management Utilities and C1 categorization of streams. He supported Christie-era rollbacks that got rid of the Septic Management Districts and weakened stormwater protections, rollbacks that still haven\u2019t been reversed. He opposed dock fees that would provide money to help clean up lakes. Now he wants to clean up streets and storm drains. That\u2019s not closing the barn door after the horse has escaped. The horse is 50 miles down the road. He attacks every program to help the environment, and then when something goes wrong and the public is an uproar, he pretends to do something. Bucco\u2019s anti-government, anti-environment, anti-regulatory policies have helped create the pollution problems in Lake Hopatcong. A little cleanup now doesn\u2019t accomplish anything.\u201d",

Bloom-forming cyanobacteria produce a variety of neurotoxins, hepatotoxins and dermatoxins, which can be fatal to birds and mammals (including waterfowl, cattle and dogs) and threaten the use of waters for recreation, drinking water production, agricultural irrigation and fisheries198. Toxic cyanobacteria have caused major water quality problems, for example in Lake Taihu (China), Lake Erie (USA), Lake Okeechobee (USA), Lake Victoria (Africa) and the Baltic Sea198,199,200.\n\n&gt;Climate change favours cyanobacterial blooms both directly and indirectly198. Many bloom-forming cyanobacteria can grow at relatively high temperatures201. Increased thermal stratification of lakes and reservoirs enables buoyant cyanobacteria to float upwards and form dense surface blooms, which gives them better access to light and hence a selective advantage over nonbuoyant phytoplankton organisms202,203. Protracted droughts during summer increase water residence times in reservoirs, rivers and estuaries, and these stagnant warm waters can provide ideal conditions for cyanobacterial bloom development204.\n\n&gt;The capacity of the harmful cyanobacterial genus Microcystis to adapt to elevated CO2 levels was demonstrated in both laboratory and field experiments205. Microcystis spp. take up CO2 and HCO3\u2212 and accumulate inorganic carbon in carboxysomes, and strain competitiveness was found to depend on the concentration of inorganic carbon. As a result, climate change and increased CO2 levels are expected to affect the strain composition of cyanobacterial blooms205.",

They only way it gets into the ocean in that scenario is if someone is trucking ships to the ocean and dumping it, and then perhaps that's the issue we need to address.\n\n&gt; but your last paragraph is pure speculation.\n\nIt's not though. Anything biodegradable is instantly out, because booster packs are kept for decades and need to remain sealed. Anything purely paper based is out, because paper wouldn't protect the cards (e.g. from humidity), never mind that the package itself would be ruined. Anything derived from petroleum would just be a shift from one type of pollutant to another. Any organic non-biodegradable plastic replacement would have the exact same issue re:the ocean plus additional ones from people confusing it with biodegradable. Any metal based solution would have at minimum the same issue re:disposal and would likely add additional ones depending on the metal used.\n\nAt the end of the day you can't have something that doesn't break down but also does break down. It's an oxymoron. On the supply side there doesn't exist materials that meets the requirements without having bigger impacts. This has been discussed many times before and many material scientists have weighed in.\n\n&gt; If current trends don't change, in 2 or 3 decades the world's oceans \n\nLuckily trends did change in the last decade or so. The US stopped recycling plastic, which was performed horrendously. The US didn't process it domestically, it shipped all the plastic back to china and was sorted in China (along with other similar countries such as Indonesia). Some of that was from accidents with boats, shipping crates falling off etc and some of it was foreign countries that have poor enforcement of environmental standards not catching companies that decided to dispose of waste plastic by dumping it in seas and the ocean. \n\n[China is responsible for 30% of ocean plastic](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/world-s-oceans-clogged-by-millions-of-tons-of-plastic-trash/) and the next offenders are Indonesia, the Phillipines, Vietnam, Sri Lanka and Thailand.\n\nThese countries have recently raised the standard of living enough that it's no longer profitable to attempt to hire people to sort through garbage and so we've stopped shipping garbage to them and have disposed of it in environmentally regulated domestic landfills which has helped reduce a lot of that waste. Now we just have to figure out a way to get environmental regulations enforced internationally so every country can make the change that we already made. \n\nPlanet Money has a good [two part series](https://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnByLm9yZy9yc3MvcG9kY2FzdC5waHA_aWQ9NTEwMjg5&amp;episode=NmI1NTM5ZDQtMDliMy00Mzg4LTg4NDMtM2M4ZjExZGVjYzkz) if you're interested in the history of landfill and recycling.",

It doesn't really decompose and anything that leeches out is caught and handled correctly (that's the point of the environmental regulations and why local dumps aren't a thing anymore).\n\nPaper on the other hand does partially decompose. Normally that'd be fine as it's CO2 neutral, but in a landfill there isn't enough oxygen to break it down to CO2. Instead it breaks down into methane, and methane is far worse in terms of GHG effects.\n\n&gt; that they would even live in an area that can accept that recycling.\n\nOr that the area even recycles it. Plastic comes in all different types and is often contaminated with food or something else (like glue). It requires sorting it by hand and paying workers even minimum wage to do that would be insanely expensive (not to mention dangerous as it could contain something toxic of biologically unsafe).\n\nWhat most nations used to do for recycling was fill those shipping containers back up with plastic and ship them back to the countries everything was imported from (e.g. China). There labour was cheaper and safety regulations were lower and it'd get sorted there. Recently these countries have started to actually respect their citizens slightly so they've stopped accepting plastic.\n\nMost recycling programs continue to take plastic in the hopes that someday we'll figure out a way to recycle it and then we won't have to reteach everyone to recycle, but chances are very good that the plastic is just ending up in the landfill. \n\n[Planet money did a good podcast on this recently](https://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnByLm9yZy9yc3MvcG9kY2FzdC5waHA_aWQ9NTEwMjg5&amp;episode=NmI1NTM5ZDQtMDliMy00Mzg4LTg4NDMtM2M4ZjExZGVjYzkz)",

Flint, as of right now, is ~50 f and ~40% humidity, it would probably be about ~50% as efficient, but lets assume that Flint is optimal for solar panels and is nice and tropical.\n\nThis means for every 1 kg of water extracted, 18 grams of carbon are \"released\" by the solar panels (technically those emissions come from the resource gathering/production, etc.,  Hence the term life-cycle emissions).\n\nThe average american truck releases 160 g CO2/ton-mile hauled.

I just briefly looked up your location and it is quite light polluted, which perhaps is why you are having trouble seeing and photographing the Milky Way. BUT, there is hope! It looks like there are some slightly darker skies further East of Monteville. Furthermore, Lake Erie looks promising if you want to short due North. This can be useful for targets facing North as well as star trails.\n\nThis time of year, the Milky Way is setting due Southwest on the horizon. The problem with that is you will be shooting facing Cleveland, so the light pollution on the horizon is washing out the Milky Way setting in that approximate location. However, and I am not quite sure how you can do this, but if you take a ferry or something to get across lake Erie such that you can shoot with it in your foreground facing due SE/S/SW, you will be able to grab the Milky Way far more effectively. This is because rather than light pollution in your direction of shooting, you will have a nice dark, unpopulated area for the stars to shine. The lake would also make for some awesome reflections compositionally.\n\nPhotopills is a great app, but it can be a little confusing at first.

They're consuming huge numbers of fish in areas that aren't used this type or number of predators.\n\nIn addition to that, their droppings  change the pH (of water and soil) causing everything to die which leads to  erosion. This in some areas has completely destroyed islands.  On Lake Erie for example, a cormorant colony of 20,000 has wiped out an estimated 40 percent of the tree canopy on Middle Island - that's a 46 acre island! \n\nLook I love wildlife - I just find their numbers are getting out of control and there's no real good solution to manage their numbers which is really concerning to me.",

        "I\u2019m on the east coast of Florida in Indian River County, the red tide on the west coast made it to me last fall, basically around and up the coast from the Gulf. I\u2019ve been very involved in several organizations addressing water issues in my area. Working with local politicians, organizing, and educating. So I\u2019m happy to rant a little bit about them. \n\nAlgae Blooms are happening all over the world at a rate hitherto unseen. Rising temperatures and climate change are exacerbating them and we as modern peoples are woefully unprepared for their impacts. \n\nPotable water sources all over are imperiled and strained by them. An example is [in Lake Erie and water taken from there. ](https://www.wxyz.com/news/giant-algae-bloom-returns-to-lake-erie-threatens-drinking-water). Most water treatment plants do not currently treat water for certain bacteria caused by the blooms. Cyanobacteria is an example of this. Getting it out of drinking water requires specialized treatment which many plants do not use as they\u2019ve never needed it before. This is expanded on in a very scary but interesting documentary called [The Toxic Puzzle.](https://www.toxicpuzzle.com/)\n\nOne of the biggest causes of the blooms is nutrient pollution (especially nitrogen and prosperous) and the best way to stop them is to stop nutrient pollution. Easier said then done though. Pretty much just our living our 21st century lives causes nutrient pollution. In Florida our population grows by about 900 people per day. We\u2019re reaching the tipping point in many of our waterways. (As an aside, add in the archaic Florida water permitting laws and republican crony stacked water management districts and we have huge problems.) \n\nMoney is the biggest thing stopping us from addressing real issues. Florida has over 2 million septic tanks. Any built before 1983 can be within 6 inches of the water table. (They added stricter regulations in 83, but older systems were grandfathered in and many pre-1983 septics are still in use today. [source from Indian River County. ](http://www.ircutilities.com/S2S/Presentation.pdf) \n\nSo we are literally pooping into the water. How do we know? One way is Sucralose, lose, an artificial sweetener that cannot be broken down by the body or any treatment process for that matter. [source](http://www.fau.edu/newsdesk/articles/septic-system-study.php). It is an ingredient in diet sodas and the like. No way that could be in the water unless someone is dumping Diet Coke or the septic tanks are a leaking. \n\nThat doesn\u2019t even take into account into the bacterial like enteric bacteria which is found in waste. This caused the closure of beaches this year and last year here... And they only test three spots in the whole county... once a week. [Source. ](https://www.tcpalm.com/story/news/local/indian-river-lagoon/health/2019/08/16/bacteria-warning-indian-river-lagoon-sebastian-inlet-state-park/2028210001/)\n\nNot really great for our tourism.  \n\nAt this point I try to stay away from the water personally because of the various health threats. A guy was killed here a few years ago from a flesh eating bacteria that he got from fishing. Others have also died. [source. ](https://www.tcpalm.com/story/news/local/indian-river-lagoon/health/2017/01/06/vibrio-vulnificus-indian-river-lagoon-bacteria/96166924/)\n\nBut I wish septics were the only problem. They are not. Other issues are fertilizers which are basically nitrogen. So add them to your non-native yard, it rains like it does in tropical Florida and it washes a bunch of nitrogen and phosphorus into our waterways, furthering the blooms and bad things in the water. Thankfully many cities and counties around here have banned application of fertilizer in the summer rainy season. But golf courses and Ag are exempted. And of course they are some of the biggest polluters. Add in that many local big box stores don\u2019t care about local regulations and thus they still sell fertilizer even when it is illegal to apply it. [source. ](http://ircstormwater.com/fertilizer.htm)\n\nYet another contributor is stormwater runoff. As you probably know, Florida is pretty flat. It used to be a swamp for the most part. I live in what was once part of Mosquito County [(old map) ](https://www.floridamemory.com/blog/2018/12/21/a-county-called-mosquito/)because they had a lot of swampy standing water. In the middle of the 20th Century, as people were discovering how lovely the weather is in Florida, the state and local municipalities undertook one of the most ambitious engineering projects of the time, draining the swamps and straightening the rivers and making more land for people and farms. These canals still exist today and are maintained rigorously to avoid flooding. This basically flushes all the rain water to our lagoon and oceans. Untreated. So we also get septic pollution washing out from houses away from the waterways and also trash and plant waste (branches, grass clippings, etc.) in our waters. Some parking lots drain directly to the lagoon or ocean with no treatment. There are several stormwater parks in our area which treat the water in a natural way, as it passes through. Nature set itself up to clean out a certain amount of nitrogen from water as it goes by, trees use it (like our beautiful Mangroves) but there is too much now. [Source, but I said a lot here and it may not all be covered here. ](http://ircstormwater.com/)\n\nThis does not take into account the damage the freshwater does to the Indian River Lagoon, which is brackish (a mix of fresh and salt water) and messes with the ecosystems in the water. \n\nA further complication is \u201csewage sludge.\u201d The right wing PC word for this is Biosolids. Biosolids are the de-watered sewage by-product of wastewater (sewage) treatment plants. Despite the name, biosolids are predominantly water, typically containing only 20% solids. Because they are biologically active, nutrient-rich, and contain chemical compounds as well as toxic metals, disposal of biosolids onto open land is a major threat to our waters. Land application of these were banned in South Florida, so they moved up north and farmers were applying \u201cfree\u201d fertilizer to their farms with sewage sludge from south Florida. My county has put a 6 month moratorium on these, but can not ban them completely due to state law. This led to a terrible bloom in Blue Cypress Lake last year. [source](https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-blue-cypress-lake-tragedy-20180720-story.html)\n\nSo back to money, just replacing all the septics in my county (all 30k of them) would cost the taxpayers an estimated $500 Million. I can not find a source for this but I heard the number from the IRC Director of Utilities at a meeting last week. One of the previous links provided the way they are doing it now, by fixing the biggest problems first, and could be done in a few hundred years at their current rate. \n\nAnother way money is a big problem is that special interests buy a lot of influence. And the state legislature is doing pretty much nothing to stop it. [example. ](https://www.miamiherald.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/carl-hiaasen/article236586568.html) [another example. ](https://www.tampabay.com/news/environment/2019/10/24/new-florida-wildlife-corridor-expedition-aims-to-show-what-new-toll-roads-would-destroy/)\n\nA few years ago there was a big victory for environmental groups, we had a citizen amendment called Florida Water and Land Conservation Initiative, Amendment 1 (2014). [Amendment info.](https://ballotpedia.org/Florida_Water_and_Land_Conservation_Initiative,_Amendment_1_(2014)). The legislature did not like this and did not abide with (at least) the spirit of the law. [source. ](https://news.wjct.org/post/court-backs-florida-lawmakers-conservation-fight) The money was supposed to buy and conserve land but has been used for other purposes. My favorite was to pay FDEP Tech Support salaries. Basically they took the money And used it for things that weren\u2019t proper uses so they could get away without cutting other programs or raising taxes. \n\nAll of this said, this may be more than you asked for but it really pisses me off how pretty little people care about their water. Water is everything, and giving crops or livestock polluted water can cause them to also be polluted. [source. ](https://www.onegreenplanet.org/environment/shocking-facts-on-how-factory-farms-cause-water-pollution/)\n\nAnd I didn\u2019t even get into things like [Glyphosate (Round Up)](https://usrtk.org/pesticides/glyphosate-health-concerns/) or when [there are sewer spills into the water. ](http://veronews.com/2018/07/26/city-aerating-bethel-creek-part-cleanup-effort-sewage-spill/)\n\nBasically we\u2019re a mess down here. Send help. But in all seriousness, I do have hope that this year the legislature will do *something*. It\u2019s an election year after all but we need a lot of help and Gov. DeSantis\u2019 proposed legislation does not go far enough, imo. \n\nSorry for any typos. Am in an app on my phone. Hope this helped. There\u2019s so much more going on, but I fear we are on the brink of ecosystem crash here.",

In 2014, it left 400,000 people without drinking water for three days after toxins infiltrated Toledo\u2019s water system. Then-Gov. John Kasich declared a state of emergency and called in the National Guard to distribute bottled water in an incident that served notice that drinking water from Lake Erie was in peril.\n\n\n&gt;This year, the bloom was among the most severe and toxic since scientists began keeping track in the early 2000s. At its peak, it coated around 620 square miles of Lake Erie\u2019s surface waters, an area more than twice the size of Chicago, according to satellite imagery.

There were very few things considered truly disposable. My friends were much the same even if their folks weren't quite as strict as mine. We used things up. Buying even a cheap tent to leave behind somewhere would be unthinkable. We would pack it away for that future date when we or someone we knew might have a use for it - even just a kid \"camping\" in the back yard. But I failed to impress this value on to my kids when they were still at home somehow. They preferred to buy cheap new stuff over having free hand me downs. When they moved out, they griped about taking old furniture, for instance, where I had been thrilled to get anything that allowed me to spread my money further. I'm sure there are a few tents in the garage that were used once and forgotten and another tent bought for the next camping trip. Funny though, now that they are established, and raising families and have true money concerns, they are less wasteful.\n\nI find it really strange that in this day of sooooo much concern for the environment, that this kind of carelessness is prevalent. My parents generation thought nothing of burning whatever crap they had to save on a trip to the dump, and had no idea that a lot of it might be toxic. But they reused jars and margarine containers.

Lake Erie is like a bathtub and rocks and fossils just wash up continuously. \nHunt along the beaches, particularly ones with stones. I've found lots of corals and bivalves over the years.

        "There are a few reasons for it that come to mind for me.\n\nPeople do have a short memory about this sort of thing.  Which has always been the case.  There is also the factor of people saying \"it won't happen here\" or \"it won't happen again\".  \n\nThose are just part of human nature though.  I don't think there is anything we can do to get rid of those factors.  \n\nHonestly, I think one of the biggest problems with people's lack of preparedness is the \"culture of preparedness\".  I consider myself a prepper and even then a lot of what I see turns me off from it.\n\nI keep my prepping fairly quiet, and I prep for very normal things.  Major storms, large scale power outages, etc etc.  My in laws had no idea I was a prepper until the summer of 2014 (a year after the wife and I got married) when Toledo (where they live) had a toxic algae bloom in Lake Erie and the water for the entire town was dangerous to even touch with your skin for several days and not safe to drink for over a week.\n\nMy wife of course knew I was a prepper and always thought I was a bit crazy about it.  She always thought if something happened you just run to the store and get what you need real fast.\n\nWe got a call at 8:45 am about the situation from her parents.  Her entire family (about 16 people) who lived in the city had run out to stores and bought what they could.  However it wasn't much.  \n\nMany of her family members had gone to Ann Arbor, Cleveland and other \"nearby\" towns two and three hours away to get water and found shelves were empty.\n\nThe wife went to buy some water for them here in Columbus (about 3 hours from Toledo) and found that by the time she got to the store around 10am that they were sold out down here too.\n\nThe wife came home and had this look on her face like she hated that she had to admit that I was right about how fragile our modern infrastructure actually is.  \n\nI loaded up the truck with 20 5 gallon bottles of water that I had in the basement  (Side note, carrying 800 pounds of water up stairs sucks) and we went trucking towards toledo.  \n\nI called two of my buddies to ride up there and help me out with the water deliveries.  I told the wife it was because I wanted help lugging the water.  Really it was because I wanted help securing the water as I had a feeling people would be getting desperate.  We all three have our concealed carry permits.  But that day we all three open carried and made sure to bring a few extra magazines.  I also wore a vest under my shirt, which thankfully was not needed.\n\nThe truck was full when we left town, but with all that extra weight and interstate driving I had to get gas.  My two buddies got out of the truck while I did \"to stretch their legs\".  \n\nWhile nobody got violent and tried to steal our water.  Four or five people did come up to us begging for the water.  Some offered to buy it most just begged for it.\n\nAfter we finish dropping off the water at all of her family's various houses my father in law said something to the effect of \"I'm glad we called you and you were able to grab this water for us in Columbus\".\n\nThen the wife told him that Columbus was sold out too and all this water was already sitting in our basement because I was a \"prepper\".\n\nTheir response was something to the affect of \"But he's a normal person.\".  \n\nBasically, they thought preppers were crazy people.  And I don't really blame people who think that.  Everytime you see or hear about preppers it always comes across as crazy.  People talking about Zombies, Aliens, Nuclear war, The complete collapse of our entire society resulting in a mad max movie, armed uprisings, WW3 etc etc.\n\nThey also talk about how you have to have your own private army and arsenal that could rival a small country and you need to be able to fight like you are a real life action hero.\n\nVery rarely do you hear preppers talking about things like hurricanes, Earthquakes, tornadoes, blizzards, drought, water table contamination, layoffs, etc etc.\n\nEven I, as a prepper get tired of people only talking about the crazy things (that yes, mostly could happen but aren't very likely) and ignoring the things that absolutely will happen.\n\n\nTLDR;\n\n\nWhen the city the In Laws live in had a water crisis and found out I was a prepper by me bringing them 20 5 gallon bottles of water they were surprised I was a prepper because \"I wasn't crazy\".  \n\nMost people consider preppers to be crazy because more preppers talk about things like the complete collapse of society resulting in a mad max movie (which could happen but isn't very likely) instead of things like layoffs due to a bad economy or a hurricane (which absolutely will happen).\n\nIMO many people don't prep because many preppers come off as crazy.",

In fact, the longest offshore bloom in recorded history of red tide was ongoing until it moved inshore this year.  \n\nIt's true that that blooms start offshore, but the discharges create a perfect storm for them to move inshore and do their dirty work.  And by in-shore, I mean under 10 miles from shore, because i've personally see the discharge color break 8 miles out in my own boat.   [New research has shown that K. brevis feeds off way more sources, fertilizers included, then we previously thought.](https://www.sailorsforthesea.org/programs/ocean-watch/nutrients-feed-red-tide)\n\nDo you think the same thing about the blue-green cyanobacteria?

Yes, its a natural bacteria, but it would never get to this level naturally without all the food we give it.\n\n[Even fucking Ohio gets it and the governor, also a Republican, took emergency action to reduce the levels of run-off heading into Lake Erie because IT FEEDS THE ALGAE/BACTERIA BLOOMS.](https://www.cleveland.com/expo/news/erry-2018/07/49b4353a83940/lake-eries-2018-harmful-algal.html) .

        "&gt;  just because the decisions are going to be made locally, doesn't mean that the decisions will be better \n\nYou're right, it doesn't mean the decisions will *necessarily* be better, but the decisions will at least be able to respond to the local needs. With state control, the decisions will likely just follow what's needed in NYC because that's where the voter base is, and all decisions are forced to fall in line with that. But Manhattan is worlds apart from South Bronx, let alone a small town along Lake Erie. I'm not saying local control is a panacea, and I doubt Larry is saying that either, I just think it would tend to yield better results as a whole.\n\nI don't know if you've worked at a company larger than a few dozen people, but hopefully this parallel will resonate with you. If you've worked at a medium sized company, you may have noticed that upper management or corporate occasionally imposes sweeping standards on everyone. Maybe it works well for a third of the groups in the company or even two thirds, but almost invariably, certain groups become less efficient because those standards don't quite work for them. The firm I work for allows for localized control over certain things and those things work really well, but there are some burdensome office wide standards that don't make any sense to us (obviously they make sense to SOMEone at corporate) and we in the satellite office have to fight and claw just to get them to allow us to things the way we think it should be done (sometimes we literally have to \"hide\" things from them so we can do what's best for us). And very often, when we are allowed to do things our way, things get better (for us). Do we make better decisions for ourselves than corporate? It certainly appears that we do. Do we make the *right* decisions? Certainly not all the time. Can we make better decisions for corporate than corporate themselves? Probably not.\n\nThe basic logic is that even if the smartest, rightiest, and bestest people work in Albany (or DC), the local bodies will *always* understand their local problems and issues better than those people in Albany (starting with parents themselves, then the local schools, then the districts and so on), and actually understanding them inherently gives them an advantage. Even the smartest person in the world can't figure something out if they can't possibly know the issues for each region in the first place. It's a very basic libertarian understanding...the individual knows more about him/herself than the community can, the community knows more about itself than the state can, the state knows more about itself than the nation can. That's why power should be as localized as possible (down to the individual).\n\nThere is another aspect to it, but seeing as how I've written too much already, I'll keep it quick...it's that when the state controls education, you only have one model to evaluate. When you have a bunch of different regions in charge of themselves, you'll have a bunch of different models to evaluate. From multiple models, you are much more likely to figure out which are good models and which are bad models.\n\nYes, I like charter schools as well. But given the \"blueness\" of New York, I'm not sure if talking about charter schools will get a positive or negative reaction. Where I am in California, it seems like when someone says the words \"charter school\", people hear \"I want rich people to kill kids for sport\".",

There's a strong chance that they're going to be contributing in a non-insignificant manner to contamination of the water, and also contributing substantially to the temperature of the water (which directly contributes in some ways to algal blooms).\n\nI don't believe that there will be proper precautions in place for cooling, and so effectively we're going to see a non-trivial amount of water leaving the system, a large amount of heat energy entering the system, and the potential for industrial contaminants that are generally highly regulated. Generally speaking, these companies receive regulatory loopholes due to unforeseen weather related circumstances - meaning that e.g. during the Spring or periods of heavy rain, Foxconn may be legally allowed to dump amounts of completely raw waste into the watershed. \n\nThe impact is certainly going to be much more minimal than if the factory were to e.g. be built in Cleveland, but unfortunately we're at the ass end of Lake Erie which leads to many of our beach related maladies.",

We're forced to take classes(that we have to pay for) to teach us how to \"safely\" spray our manure on our own fields. Factory farms can afford to do this, but it is a ridiculous waste of time and money off the farm for most of us.

        "For starters, there is no uniform limit on lake erie fish. You can eat more then 4 servings of numerous species. It heavily depends on the type of fish and where you caught it, as well as the age of the fish and whether or not you are pregnant, or are considering pregnancy. The 2018 NY state fishing regulations magazine has a chart available, although I can't find mine at the moment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSecondly, farm raised fish have plenty of toxins of their own. The same dietery restrictions generally exist for farmed fish as they would for lake erie fish. How much you should eat will depend on the type of fish, where it was farmed and other factors. The cheap tilapia you buy in the grocery store is fed the cheapest possible trash that keep the fish just barely healthy enough to make it to slaughter. In order to keep so many fish in such a small area alive, they are pumped full of antibiotics and the water is doused with regular pesticides.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot to mention it tastes like crap.

        "It's definitely an important part of designing any new developments right now. Most new subdivisions are going to have a pile of ditching and sewer running to wet/dry ponds. Some do it well, some seem more like they are just ticking off boxes on a list somewhere.\n\nInfrastructure remediation is a major field. A lot of the older parts of cities like Toronto or Kingston have combined sewer systems where sewage and storm water are combined into one pipe. This can overload wastewater treatment plants during heavy rain falls and cause untreated overflows into the lake. These systems are generally being replaced but it's going to take a long time to completely separate them.\n\nAgricultural runoff can create algae blooms which are terrible for lakes. This is a common issue for Lake Erie which is too shallow to really dilute the problem away. There are some provincial programs aiming to create a buffer of land between farms and watercourses to help contain the runoff before it reaches the water. Many cottage country municipalities have toughened up regulations around septic systems near lakes for similar reasons. \n\nThe realignment and renaturalization of the mouth of the Don River in Toronto is an interesting project to help prevent storm flooding in the portlands and provide more green space in the harbour area. The ravines in Toronto have been protected from development since Hurricane Hazel hit in 1954 and killed 81 people in the floodplains of the rivers there. It's an example of a storm having wide ranging urban planning effects and led to the wonderful park system that is there today.\n\nSalt runoff from winter road salting is an interesting problem here. Some creeks can get saltier than the ocean during the spring melt. Spring flooding is an annual issue that makes the news. It was pretty bad in the Ottawa area just in the last month and usually at least starts conversations about land use or watershed controls.\n\nJust a few topics to look into if you are interested. It's very Central Ontario oriented but I'm sure that similar things are happening no matter where you are.",

I'm not as nuanced with Lake Michigan, but i would imagine this would be even more profound in Chicago as its a more industrial and much larger city in general. There are no River otters anywhere close to the metropolitan cleveland area. They mainly stay in adjacent counties of Lake, Ashtabula, etc. Would you say this mimics your sightings?\n\nEdit: As for adaptation, human introduced barriers are much more sudden then those nature presents. It would be difficult for them to adapt to the constant changes that humans present. Without realization of our interactions with the environment, animals wont have time to adapt. They will simply die off. I wouldnt expect to see open water versions you mention, for these reasons. The only change we will see is if we make conscious efforts to embolden them and extend their habitats.

The environmental affects that their built up waste / fecal matter create in the immediate area of these farms, is also something worth noting. Fertlization and pesticide sprays used on agricultural farms, can also cause significant run off into water sheds, rivers, and lakes. The algal bloom that is plagueing Lake Erie, and the southern parts of Lake Huron currently are largely caused by this factor. The author's connections between 'not eating animal product' and the eventual decline in industrialized animal farming are fairly assumed, however missing out on some key factors. A good number of industrialized farms are part of very large organizations / corporations. The success of which has a large impact on our economy.

Despite being caused by the extremes in weather we see up here, the local government's ability to stay on top of it seems to be getting noticeable worse.According to [an article from a couple of years ago ](https://www.cityclub.org/blog/2016/01/04/what-would-it-take-to-fix-cleveland-s-roads) they were spending only 3% of what it would take to fix the existing infrastructural problems. Anecdotally, I would say the situation has only worsened since then.\n\n* Water quality concerns. Despite the utility companies assuring us that our water quality is fine and that there's nothing to worry about, the phosphorous-induced toxic algae blooms in Lake Erie returned in 2004 and [are an ongoing issue](https://amp.detroitnews.com/amp/779473002). For those of you who don't know, these are clusters or \"blooms\" of cyanobacteria that can produce dangerous toxins, and people living within half a mile of lakes with algae blooms are [2.3 times more likely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanobacteria#Health_risks) to develop ALS, or Lou Gehrig's Disease. Note to self: move up move out date.\n\n* Financial struggles are increasing. As with most places in the U.S. [prices are increasing](https://www.bls.gov/regions/midwest/summary/blssummary_cleveland_oh.pdf); Cleveland however falls below the national average for wages and our unemployment rate is higher than average. It doesn't take an economics student to see that this discrepancy between wage-earning and price increase spells trouble ahead. The more I research this the more I see that Cleveland mirrors national trends relatively closely on most graphs, we're just doing so in a generally worse manner by most metrics. Anecdotally most of my coworkers and friends are struggling, a evidenced by many of them looking for side jobs, joining pyramid schemes and in launching their own businesses - most of them don't have a passion for business or new product mind you - the main reason is always \"I need extra sources of income\".\n\nThis is my first M.O. thread so I'm not sure if this I'm doing this correctly!",

Indeed, in early 2008 the Cotter Corporation\n&gt; was fined $40,000 for the death of 40 geese and ducks at the\n&gt; Ca\u00f1on City Uranium Mill in Colorado. The birds apparently ingested\n&gt; contaminated water at one of the settling ponds at the uranium\n&gt; mine [1]. These deaths can be very roughly quantified into 0.006\n&gt; deaths per GWh. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service [31] has also\n&gt; noted that abandoned open pit uranium mines in Wyoming can\n&gt; form pit lakes hazardous to wildlife. Uranium-bearing formations\n&gt; are usually associated with strata containing high concentrations of\n&gt; selenium. It is not uncommon for these pits to kill 300 birds per\n&gt; year. Because those mines operated at about one-tenth the\n&gt; efficiency of Canon City, they would correlate to about 0.45 deaths\n&gt; per GWh. Taking the mean from both uranium mines gets us 0.228\n&gt; fatalities per GWh.\n&gt; Like fossil fueled power stations and wind farms, avian fauna\n&gt; can also collide with nuclear power plants. Three thousand birds\n&gt; died in two successive nights in 1982 from collisions with smokestacks\n&gt; and cooling towers at Florida Power Corporation\u2019s Crystal\n&gt; River Generating Facility [1]. Given that the power plant now hosts\n&gt; an 838 MW nuclear reactor, and presuming it operated with\n&gt; a capacity factor of 90% and that the 3000 deaths were the only\n&gt; ones throughout the year, the facility was responsible for 0.454\n&gt; avian deaths per GWh. Ornithologists observed 274 fatal bird\n&gt; collisions with an elevated cooling tower at the Limerick nuclear\n&gt; power plant in Pennsylvania from 1979 to 1980 [32]. Since the\n&gt; Limerick plant has a 1200 MW reactor, and also assuming it operated\n&gt; at a 90% capacity factor, it was responsible for 0.261 deaths per\n&gt; GWh. At the Susquehanna plant in eastern Pennsylvania, 1500 dead\n&gt; birds were collected between 1978 and 1986 for an average of 187\n&gt; fatalities per year [33]. Assuming that the 2200 MW plant operated\n&gt; at 90% capacity factor, it was responsible for 0.01 deaths per GWh.\n&gt; Extensive surveys for dead birds were also conducted at the\n&gt; Davis-Bess nuclear plant near Lake Erie in Northern Ohio. Ornithologists\n&gt;  recorded a total of 1554 bird fatalities or an average of 196 per year from 1972 to 1979 [33]. Given that the power plant\n&gt; hosts an 873 MW reactor, and assuming it operated with a 90%\n&gt; capacity factor, and the plant was responsible for 0.0285 fatalities\n&gt; per GWh. Taking the mean for each of the four power plants results\n&gt; in 0.188 deaths per GWh.\n&gt; The total avian deaths per GWh for nuclear power plants are\n&gt; therefore about 0.416\n\n[Source - The Avian Benefits of Wind Energy: A 2009 Update](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271574560_The_avian_benefits_of_wind_energy_A_2009_update)",

In essence, the ballot question asks whether Lake Erie has the legal right \u201cto exist, flourish, and naturally evolve.\u201d\n\nThe City of Toledo depends on Lake Erie for its drinking water. In 2014, phosphorous pouring into the lake from nearby farms made the city\u2019s drinking water unfit for human consumption for three long days in the middle of summer. According to the New York Times, \u201cStores closed. Hospitals accepted only the most seriously ill patients. Restaurants were empty. And some 500,000 people depended on bottled water in the middle of a brutally hot August.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, Lake Erie has been covered in green algae that sickened swimmers and dogs. The slicks were large enough to see from space. Yet the ballot initiative is pitting members of the community against each other. Everyone agrees that farms near the lake are largely responsible for the phosphorous and other runoff from fertilizers that cause the algae blooms and undrinkable water. But much of the local economy depends on those same farmers for its existence, especially at a time when the automakers who used to employ tens of thousands of area residents have reduced their operations in an around Toledo dramatically.\n\nForcing People To Confront The Problem\n\nThomas Linzey is the executive director of the Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund, a nonprofit group based in Pennsylvania that helped write the Toledo ballot initiative. He says it has two objectives. One, to send a warning the community is fed up with a lack of state and federal action to protect Lake Erie. Two, to force the courts to recognize that ecosystems like the lake \u201cpossess independent rights to survive and be healthy.\u201d He says, \u201cThere\u2019s no precedent for any of this. It is almost a new consciousness \u2014 that a community is not just Homo sapiens.\u201d\n\nActually, there is a tiny bit of legal justification on the side of the environmental activists, but it is a very slender reed indeed to build an argument around. In 1972, Supreme Court justice William O. Douglas, one of the most fearsome intellects to ever sit on the court, wrote a dissent in the case of Sierra Club v. Morton in which the majority rejected a claim that the natural world has legal rights.\n\nDouglas disagreed, writing, \u201cContemporary public concern for protecting nature\u2019s ecological equilibrium should lead to the conferral of standing upon environmental objects to sue for their own preservation.\u201d Such willingness to \u201cfind\u201d novel legal principles buried within the language of the Constitution is, of course, anathema to conservative judges spoon fed on the absurd theory of \u201coriginalism\u201d that permeates many of the seminal cases decided by the Court this century.\n\nA 15-Year Campaign\n\nLinzey\u2019s group began working with towns and cities to protect local natural resources 15 years ago. Since then the idea that nature has rights has won support in dozens of municipalities \u2014 from cities with long histories of environmental activism to unexpected places like Tamaqua, Pennsylvania in the heart of that state\u2019s coal mining region. It became the first place in the nation to approve a rights-of-nature ordinance in 2006 after it banned companies from dumping dredged minerals and sewage sludge into open pit mines.\n\nFour years later, Pittsburgh approved a rights-of-nature ordinance that prohibited fracking in city limits. Santa Monica, California, has since passed an ordinance that requires the city to \u201crecognize the rights of people, natural communities and ecosystems to exist, regenerate and flourish.\u201d Earlier this year, the White Earth Band of the Ojibwe tribe in Minnesota announced that it had granted wild rice its own legal rights, including \u201cthe right to pure water.\u201d\n\nDemonizing Farmers Is Not The Answer\n\nThe Toledo ballot initiative has created political fault lines in the community. Yvonne Lesicko, vice president for public policy for the Ohio Farm Bureau acknowledges that farms are the primary contributors to the algae blooms and pollution afflicting Lake Erie. But she also points out other sources of harmful runoff include lawns, septic systems, and golf courses.\n\nFarmers are trying to limit fertilizer and pesticide use, she says, but changes may take up to 20 years to come to fruition. Can the lake wait that long? She suggests the ballot initiative is not a reasoned response to what is a very complex problem. \u201cWe care very much about the lake,\u201d she says. \u201cBut this is not a solution. In fact, it is counterproductive. This is going to lead to lots of lawsuits and stress.\u201d\n\nCity political leaders are conflicted about the ballot question. On one hand, Lake Erie is vital to what makes Toledo a place where people want to live. On the other, the city could be forced to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on legal fees to defend itself against legal challenges to the new policy if it is approved by voters.\n\n\u201cI think everybody is frustrated,\u201d Nick Komives, a member of the Toldeo city council, tells the NY Times. He says he supports a clean lake but opposed the ballot initiative because it could drain city finances. \u201cThe initiative is a powerful tactic. And for me, coming from an activist background, it is important to send messages. But this is probably unconstitutional.\u201d\n\nCapitalism And Sustainability\n\nThere is an old, fairly crude expression that goes like this: \u201cYou don\u2019t shit where you eat and you don\u2019t eat where you shit.\u201d This seems so obvious that it hardly bears repeating. Yet since the first colonists set foot in North America, the waterways have been used as little more than sewer pipes for carrying industrial, agricultural, and residential wastes to nearby rivers and lakes that carry them on to the oceans.\n\nPeople may argue about whether human activity has contributed to a warming climate but there can be no debate that algae blooms and phosphorous contamination are caused by human activity. Where did the notion originate that people could treat the environment like a community toilet and never have to suffer the consequences?\n\nCertainly the indigenous peoples knew better than to shit where they eat. What is it about colonizers that makes them think they can destroy the things that make life possible \u2014 clean air, clean water, and clean land \u2014 with impunity? If the native culture had prevailed, people and nature would have continued to live in harmony. Of course, their would be no interstate highways and SUVs, but the environment wouldn\u2019t be contributing to shortened lifespans and sickness either.\n\nAn analogy could be drawn between putting a price on dumping harmful products into the environment and putting a price on the carbon dioxide that pours into the atmosphere as the result of human activity. Behavior that has no consequences rapidly becomes antisocial but can be curbed with appropriate pricing signals.\n\nYes, the Lake Erie ballot initiative in Toledo would forever change how the local community interacts with the land and the water, but why is that a cause for concern? Just because we have been dumping poisons into the lake for hundreds a year, does that give humanity a license to continue doing so in perpetuity? Is there not some point at which people wake up from their centuries old reverie and say, \u201cWe can\u2019t continue to do this anymore?\u201d\n\nThe Lake Erie ballot initiative may or may not pass. If it does, it may or may not survive legal challenges. But it is a sign that attitudes are changing and that caring for the environment is no longer something that appeals just to treehuggers and socialists.\n\nhttps://cleantechnica.com/\u2026/should-lake-erie-have-legal-ri\u2026/",

I am assuming you're in a nicely maintained unit, without peeling paint, crumbling plaster (covered in paint) or deteriorating wallpaper. When the paint-covered walls are in poor condition, people can inhale lead-paint dust and children tend to eat peeled lead paint chip, because lead tastes sweet. \n\nYour zip code has a lot of impoverished households that can't afford to live in a maintained apartment, and are living in a poorly-maintained slumlord apartment. There a lot of places with holes in the floor, ceiling, walls and peeling wallpaper that slumlords don't fix. Children living in apartments like these inhale and ingest more lead. It's a function of *condition* more so than age, even the more recently developed suburbs are full of pre-1980 homes that likely have lead paint, but these areas aren't hotbeds of slumlording and concentrated poverty. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe third way kids ingest lead is through drinking. Throughout the *country* lead service lines were used through the early 1900s, and think of all the cities developed before then. Lead pipes (you can see this in the basement where the line enters the home, if you have them) get a coating, just like copper turns green. This coating prevents lead from dissolving into the water in it. In all the older US cities, the water engineers know about lead service pipes, and make sure the water they produce is the right pH to prevent that coating from dissolving, so the lead stays safely behind the coating. One reason Flint, MI was such a huge scandal is because they switched to a different water source and didn't treat it to make sure it had the right pH - for water engineers it's negligence, this is a basic consideration. In Buffalo, they plan for this and will never switch water sources from Lake Erie. You can also get your water tested by the Erie County health department (I think for free) if you want to be sure. If it is elevated, which also can come from crappy overseas fixtures being made with higher lead content, a national problem, then there are things you could get for your faucet before drinking - fixtures are a national problem. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you're worried, get your water checked and if your apartment is nice without deteriorating walls lead paint won't be a problem.",

        "Honestly I\u2019m not sure their is one, short of the benevolent dictator, someone that has absolute power but uses it to benefit the people.   Corporations should be able to do what they want, but also should probably have standards for workers, wages and environmental protection.  Nixon started the EPA because all the manufacturers were just polluting the shit out of everything.  See e.g.  Lake Erie, most major river systems in the Midwest.  \n\nFor every person that wants to invent the next cure for cancer, flying car, internet, there is another person working just as hard to figure out how they can profit off the work of others.\n\nSo, steps in the right direction would be (obviously these are just my opinions, and I am no way arguing that I\u2019m correct):\n\n1.  Almost all money out of elections.  No corporate donations, campaign funds capped, no pacs or superpacs or whatever else.   Federal elected officials in the US spend half their time in office fund raising.  No wonder nothing gets done.   Campaigns should be weeks long instead of years.  Election Day off. \n\n1a.  Citizens United needs to go away.  Corporations aren\u2019t people enough to get money=political speech.  Especially when they then get the loudest speech. \n\n2.  Overhaul spending for defense contractors.  No more paying before work is even started, no more $1 trillion overages on contracts for a plane that is already obsolete.  No more $400 toilet seat unless it\u2019s on a sub or plane and they don\u2019t come any cheaper.  \n\n2a.  To be fair there should also be an overhaul of the social security/Medicaid/Medicare stuff.  But I honestly have no idea how.  There probably needs to be some changes as to retirement age and that kind of thing.  And I don\u2019t want AIG or Lehman Brothers in charge of it, we see how well that went.  Fraud and overspending are problems but I\u2019m not sure how pervasive.  It seems like they arrest the doctors committing fraud sooner or later.  \n\n3.  Criminal justice reform, nonviolent offenders shouldn\u2019t be in prison for 30 years. Ain\u2019t nobody want to pay for that.  Take some of the money saved and spend it on rehabilitation programs to train people to integrate back into society and better themselves.  And private prisons probably shouldn\u2019t be in charge of that.  They aren\u2019t going to zealously work toward having less \u201ccustomers.\u201d\n\n4.  Either a robust single payer system or socialize medicine.  Something to actually drive the cost side of the equation down.  There\u2019s no reason we should have the worst healthcare system in the first world when it\u2019s also the most expensive.  Hospitals shouldn\u2019t charge $8.00 for an aspirin or cotton ball.  The doctors should be the highest paid people in healthcare, not the executives.  No more drug ads, spend that money developing new drugs to charge a shitload for.  \n\n5.  Carbon tax maybe?  I don\u2019t know about this one, but something has to be done to incentivize moving away from fossil fuels.  Oil companies should have to invest a portion of their net profits into R&amp;D for renewables. (Why they aren\u2019t anyway kind of boggles my mind, even spending 25% is like $4b/yr for Exxon.)  Not a fan of forcing this stuff but no one in power are really doing it on their own.  \n\nObviously these are all pipe dreams, like a perfect communist utopia or a perfect free market.  The problem is that big companies and governments get to a certain point where they aren\u2019t accountable to the people they are supposed to be working for.  I don\u2019t know how we fix that.  \n\nSorry for the novel, clearly I\u2019m avoiding cleaning my house.  ",

        "The flow over the falls is constantly eroding the bedrock at the base (and at the lip).  The Niagara Gorge, north from the falls to the mouth of Lake Ontario, is evidence of the falls slowly eroding its way south at a historical rate of about couple of inches per year (rates vary depending on the hardness and composition of the underlying bedrock).  The estimate is that the falls will continue retreating south -- somewhat slower now because water diversions for hydro power decrease the volume that goes over the falls, thus decreasing erosion -- eventually reaching the mouth of Lake Erie in about 100,000 years or so.  At that point, there won't be any falls anymore, just a very fast-moving flow out of Lake Erie into a very deep Niagara gorge.   ",

We've made great strides in reducing run-off and preventing further nutrient loading, but a huge issue is the legacy of previous phosphorous influxes. Phosphorous very rapidly precipitates into the sediment, where if conditions are good it will stay there unused. However, it can also act as a source to reintroduce phosphorous back into the water column and feed algal blooms if the benthos of the lake becomes anoxic. \n\nThe question isn't so much \"can nature correct itself\" but \"*how long* will nature take to correct itself\". Given time an ecosystem may revert back to baseline levels, or may equilibrate to form an entirely different type of ecosystem, though it may not benefit us. As long as we continue to interact with and pollute water sources, the ecological state of the lake will remain unbalanced. \n\nTo put into perspective the issues we deal with in environmental science and the time it takes to see the effects of positive change, let me give an example: \n\nGround water contamination is becoming a larger issue. Pollutants from the surface percolate through the soil and bedrock into aquifers where the water is stored. If an aquifer has a 60 year residence time (the amount of time it takes for water to move into and out of the aquifer), then detection of pollutants in an aquifer are from pollutants spilled decades in the past. If we say \"we want to reduce pollutants in the aquifer to a safe level by reducing surface pollution by 50%\", we must keep in mind that there are 60 years worth of pollutants which went undetected that are still percolating and infiltrating the aquifer. We may not see any benefit of our work or reductions for decades. \n\nEnvironmental science can be woefully unsatisfying. Depending on your field, you may never see the benefit of your work. But thats why its so important to do - because the longer we hold off on addressing environmental concerns, the further into the future the problem will stretch. ",

Depends a lot on the type of algae that grow in a particular place because again, some are harmless. Warmer temperatures and lower water levels caused by climate change will likely increase the amount of algae in slow-moving bodies of water like lakes and reservoirs. Not really a quick and easy solution to this. However, nutrient pollution is one aspect that is often overlooked, and in terms of fast, cost-effective solutions, there is quite a bit of low hanging fruit. For example, Lake Erie (source of the 2014 Toledo outbreak) is severely polluted with agricultural runoff. Stream-bank restoration, improved fertilizer application practices, and (the unpopular) reduction in livestock farming are all guaranteed ways of  reducing nutrient pollution that feasible, under human control, and guaranteed to have positive results. But you don't see it happening because it all costs money and humans are notoriously bad at delayed gratification, especially when the gratification is \"diluted\" among many individuals.\n\nSo where am I going with all of this?

Anyone who has studied the problem of reducing US greenhouse gas emissions to net zero \u2014 \u201cdeep decarbonization,\u201d in the lingo \u2014 knows that buildings are a top agenda item.\n\n&gt;The reason is simple: Buildings are responsible for about 40 percent of the greenhouse gases in the US. Those emissions come, in part, from the fossil fuels (primarily natural gas these days but also heating oil) burned to heat (and cool) the water and space inside buildings.\n\n&gt;That means the solution, alongside reducing and eliminating emissions from the electricity sector, is getting all those heating and cooling systems replaced by systems that are hooked up to the grid. In other words: electrification. (Electrify everything!)

From what I gather from your question you are concerned about beach closures due to high bacterial concentrations. \n\nPart of the state and federal environmental agencies\u2019 duties is to ensure the safety of the natural water bodies by reducing pollutant loading from point sources (sewage discharge) and non point sources (storm water or anything without a traceable origin).\n\nThe National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) was devised by the EPA to reduce pollution loading to water bodies. The environmental agencies regularly monitor water bodies for the core water quality metrics to determine if they are impaired. These metrics include nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus, chlorophyll (algae), and bacterial concentrations to name a few. Once a waterbody is deemed impaired for a long enough period of time, a TMDL or total maximum daily load will be drafted. TMDLs mark a specific pollutant reduction goal to be met by the city, county, and/or state for that waterbody. Often this includes BMAPs or basin management action plans that highlight specific methods and practices that should be used to reduce pollutant loading.\n\nIf the routine monitoring caught high microbial concentrations for a coastal area they may have ordered a QMRA or quantitative microbial risk assessment to determine if the presence of bacteria such as E. coli are high enough to pose a public health risk. If the risk is great then they\u2019ll shut down a beach.\n\nSorry if this is long winded, but it can be complicated even for me and I deal with this type of stuff on a regular basis.

Swamps, fens, bogs, marshes and all manner of wetland habitat were considered \u2018junk land\u2019 that would be better turned into farmland if possible. In the 1800\u2019s, swamp airs were even thought to bring disease, which was utter superstition (swamps actually smell really good unless you dig into the muck, and are quite healthy to be near). And so we drained every last square inch possible.\n\nI heavily sympathize with your everglades situation. there was a ton of swamp drained in southern Ontario - a very different kind of swamp, but wetland all the same. Drainage tiles were laid under virtually every farm field in southwestern ontario, and that area is virtually all farmland now, with areas like Chatham ballparking *less than 4% tree cover*. We took a landscape with lots of surface water and did away with it for human reasons. Southwest of Lake Erie in the states, there used to be a swamp *the size of a state*, now long gone and covered with farm fields. One of our largest and most impressive wetlands in my area of Ontario- the Minesing Wetland Complex - only exists because it was physically impossible to drain due to size and topography, and because of that it has some of our only 200+ year old trees. That\u2019s what it took to keep us away - do the remaining everglades only remain for similar reasons?\n\nIn any case, we really do take a beating to the landscape, even with its human benefits. Fresh Water will be a *monumental* issue under climate change, and given how wetlands function to retain and filter water, we will probably wish we had more available.",

Before mexican cartels change operations to produce birth control, the prohibition of BC would lead to an increase in teen pregnancy. The family structure you talk about is non existent in a family consisting of two 17 year olds and an unwanted baby. The family structure is strongest between two mature, financially stable people who actually intended to have said baby.\n\nAnd as i\u2019ve said multiple times already, deviance from \u201ctraditional family values\u201d is not the root of the world\u2019s problems, nor will it be the primary cause for the death of society.",

Well anyways we see a big plastic bag floating in the water and decide to go see what's in it. The wife grabbed a stick from the water and gives the bag a poke, but it moved very oddly. Like it's stuck, not floating. It eventually turns to the point where we can see a head under the water, along with legs and arms. I realized it was a naked girl, and her arms and legs had been hog tied behind her, and weighted by cement. The adults immediately called 911, police questioned us, then the adults me back \"home\" to the boat. It was kind of surreal tbh and I don't remember like....

        "The poverty wages are a part of the problem. Americans expect their food to be cheap, which requires poverty or slave wages. Europeans pay more for food, and their food isn\u2019t raised with so many high-tech shortcuts like CAFOs. Americans would happily farm if it didn\u2019t pay peanuts, but it\u2019s cheap because immigrants or foreigners (for imported food) usually do the work, and most of all because the government gives huge subsidies to make staple crops cheap.\n\nBut conventionally-grown staple crops (corn, wheat, soy), animal feed, and the animals that eat them are ruining Americans\u2019 health (antibiotic pesticides make the animals and humans fat\u2014that\u2019s how antibiotics work\u2014now you know why we have an obesity problem\u2014also diabetes and cardiovascular problems are out of control\u2014and this can all be linked directly to poor gut health from the toxic chemicals and Frankenfood we eat). They\u2019re also ruining our waterways and air just as much as the industrial pollution did 50 years ago. \n\nThe food system supporting the American diet we\u2019re eating is completely unsustainable with tons of externalized costs that are catching up to us in our medical bills and algae blooms. Big corporations are making bazillions of bucks off of poverty wages, taxpayer subsidies, and polluted waterways. The money is there to pay farmers better and treat the planet better, but it means these corporations will lose power.\n\nSo if you think we \u201ccan\u2019t\u201d change how we farm because of money\u2014you\u2019re absolutely right. And until the economics are changed and these big corporations are forced to pay for the damage they\u2019re doing, we can\u2019t really change anything. And the economics are all affected directly by the policies set at especially the federal level. There are ways to change the dynamics, but the politicians are happy to leave it alone since their campaigns are being supported by these corporations. And if they lose an election or retire from public office, these corporations are happy to employ them as lobbyists. \n\nIt\u2019s an insidious game where everyone thinks that changing the status quo would be too painful or scary. Consumers want to save money on buying food since they eat every day. Farmers like not having to deal with animals AND corn, they can now pick just one and it\u2019s easy because all the chemicals and whatnot make it easier. Big corporations like making big bucks selling pesticides, seeds, food, and whatever else for whatever prices they choose because most are monopolies or monopsonies, and they have no real competition. The people who don\u2019t like it are a small minority, or a huge amount of poor people who are too busy to care about politics.\n\nAnd so we will continue to have toxic algae blooms in Lake Erie because people are less afraid of undrinkable water than they are of paying more for food.",

I'm from rural Ohio, so I have, and my father's family raised cows.\n\nMost of the time when a male calf is born, they very immediately pull it from the mother cow. Cows being social animals, this is incredibly distressing. To ensure the meat stays tender they want to avoid the cows getting testosterone, so they either cut the balls out with a scalpel or crush the spermatic cords with a clamp until they're crushed to nothing. Unlike humans, we don't give them painkillers after. It fucking hurts.\n\nThey then ranch it for 6 months to a year (separated from its mother, which is, may I repeat, about as distressing as pulling any given 4 year old away from theirs) as it's growing, and then send it (often for hundreds of miles) for the last 6 months of its life a CAFO (concentrated animal feeding operation.) Then they get hauled off to slaughter on a probably shorter journey. Animals legally must be rendered insensate before they are slaughtered, but, of course, this can fail. \n\nThe problem with feeding them soy and corn is that this is an absurdly inefficient way to get your food. We have crises regarding water availability, widespread ecological damage from nitrogen and phosphorous (You can't drink out of lake erie sometimes because of fertilizer runoff in the cornfields that we use to feed the cows). \n\nThe return on investment on the calories in the form of grain/corn/soy is between 1/5th and 1/20th depending on what you feed the cows, where the cows live, and the breed of the cows. It's a massive investment for a relatively low (and unhealthy, in the absurd quantities that average Americans eat meat) return on investment that causes a lot of ecological problems, because whatever's happening, we're not feeding those cows shit that was grown without using the fertilizers that cause algae blooms and damage the great lakes, US rivers, and estuaries. \n\nThis is how it works, and they do not live happily.

I may look at these issues with a little more of a public health slant because of my background working in chemical and biological defense, particularly on the medical side, and my concerns with both of my parents, despite being eight years in age apart, suddenly developing mobility issues in the same month. They had well water. Of course working in programs like nerve agent (essentially pesticides) treatments, my mind went straight to some form of environmental contaminant. As a mother, since my child wants to go play in Winter's Run near our house, I want to make certain that we have clean water and air and our kids aren't being poisoned when they play in it. The Chesapeake Bay is critical not just as a jewel of the district, but it's also a large part of our economy. We have to restore the natural processes that clean the water. We also have these storms hitting our eastern shore causing significant damage, and chronic flooding will soon be if not already is a MAJOR issue in MD-01, so it is imperative that we address these things. On food systems, obviously you have similar concerns about what pesticides are being used, but in addition to environmental concerns, I get concerned about reductions in standards like those proposed in King's amendment to the Farm Bill (it was essentially the lowest common  denominator approach and undermining state regs like in the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act) and things like horse slaughter, because when we allow American horses, which are given medicines known to be toxic for humans to consume, and then they are shipped off to other countries for slaughter for human consumption, 1) we're poisoning other countries' food supplies, and 2) that meat is processed in the same plants as much of our beef, and we're finding horse DNA in our meat products. \n\nI know this is not laid out very clearly - it has been a long day and I will try to return and clear it up in the future. I think the takeaway is that you can count on me to make sure that we have a clean environment and that we are protecting our land and waterways, because our future literally depends on it. I may not be an expert in all of these things but I definitely know who to call.\n\nRe the TMDL requirements, this is not my area of expertise and I would phone an expert. However, it seems as though looking for ways to reduce them would be wise and worth investing in - and I would absolutely lean on the northern watershed states to make sure they\u2019re doing their part to meet the clean water goals of the Bay.

I would imagine a sizable boost in water clarity and underwater grasses. The blooms this year [have been incredibly promising](https://www.wm.edu/news/stories/2018/underwater-grasses-in-chesapeake-bay-continue-record-growth.php) and they are one of the largest factors in health since besides providing habitat, they hold in sediment to improve water clarity and produce oxygen to help combat dead zones, which combine to promote more underwater growth and sustain more life. Current TMDL initiatives around Maryland have helped, but there's still a lot of work left to do. Particularly around Baltimore and DC, aging sanitary systems release a ridiculous amount of raw sewage into the bay. When most of the 64,000 square mile watershed is in PA and NY, it will take a lot of efforts from those states as well which is harder to do when they don't reap the benefits of the bay or suffer the consequences themselves. Farmers in PA add a great deal of nitrogen pollution from fertilizing their farms. Increased nitrogen causes algal blooms which in turn decrease dissolved oxygen content when bacteria break down the blooms. And on top of all of this, the Conowingo Dam at the top of the bay which should help control this runoff is [in a dire situation](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/investigations/bs-md-conowingo-dam-20170715-story.html).

        "&gt; and it is not necessary for survival\n\nMany things are not \"necessary\" for survival. That does not mean they are not *beneficial* for survival. Intelligence is unquestionably beneficial. \n\n&gt;  I am curious to know if you guys think high intelligence is dominant in nature or will eventually cause us to become extinct.\n\nIt is certainly possible, but if there is a way out of these issues, our intelligence is key to finding it. \n\n&gt; We can see that our life span is increasing and over population is becoming an issue, but at the same time we are slowly causing the earth to be unsustainable for life (obviously very slowly: deforestation, depleting of the ozone, etc).\n\nYour question is the entire topic of Stephen Pinker's wonderful book [Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress](https://www.amazon.com/Enlightenment-Now-Science-Humanism-Progress-ebook/dp/B073TJBYTB/). He makes the very compelling case that most of the things we are worried about are either not really problems at all, or they have practical solutions if we just apply ourselves. This isn't just some baseless opinion, he actually makes his case with very strong evidence. \n\nFor example, in the case of both of the examples you cite, we have already turned the corner on those problems. \n\nFor deforestation:\n\n&gt; Many of the improvements can be seen with the naked eye. Cities are less often shrouded in purple-brown haze, and London no longer has the fog\u2014actually coal smoke\u2014that was immortalized in Impressionist paintings, gothic novels, the Gershwin song, and the brand of raincoats. Urban waterways that had been left for dead\u2014including Puget Sound, Chesapeake Bay, Boston Harbor, Lake Erie, and the Hudson, Potomac, Chicago, Charles, Seine, Rhine, and Thames rivers (the last described by Disraeli as \u201ca Stygian pool reeking with ineffable and intolerable horrors\u201d)\u2014have been recolonized by fish, birds, marine mammals, and sometimes swimmers. Suburbanites are seeing wolves, foxes, bears, bobcats, badgers, deer, ospreys, wild turkeys, and bald eagles. As agriculture becomes more efficient (chapter 7 ), farmland returns to temperate forest, as any hiker knows who has stumbled upon a stone wall incongruously running through a New England woodland. Though tropical forests are still, alarmingly, being cut down, between the middle of the 20th century and the turn of the 21st the rate fell by two-thirds (figure 10-4 ).  Deforestation of the world\u2019s largest tropical forest, the Amazon, peaked in 1995, and from 2004 to 2013 the rate fell by four-fifths. \n\nHe doesn't seem to address ozone depletion in the book (at least it's not in the index, but I thought I remembered him talking about it), but it is generally considered one of the biggest successes in the history of environmentalism. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_depletion):\n\n&gt; The ban came into effect in 1989. Ozone levels stabilized by the mid-1990s and began to recover in the 2000s. Recovery is projected to continue over the next century, and the ozone hole is expected to reach pre-1980 levels by around 2075.[4] The Montreal Protocol is considered the most successful international environmental agreement to date.\n\nThat is not to say that we aren't still facing real issues, but he makes the case that the only way we can address the real issues we face is by embracing our intelligence, and stopping the war on science that so many  people on both the right and left are engaged in. It really is an eye-opening book, and I cannot recommend it highly enough.\n\nEdit: I'll add that if you are an audiobook fan, I really liked the audiobook of Enlightenment now. The Narrator does an excellent job, and made what was a fairly dense bit of information easier to digest. \n\nEdit 2: I just saw the book [Factfulness: Ten Reasons We're Wrong About the World - and Why Things Are Better Than You Think](https://www.amazon.com/Factfulness-Reasons-Wrong-Things-Better/dp/B07BFDCWZP) linked from Pinker's book. While I have not read it, from the reviews it seems to cover much of the same information as Pinker's book and might be easier to digest. I just bought the audio book, so I will try to remember to update this review after I finish it. First note, though, the narrator is not as good as Pinker's.\n",

But these gobies are ALL OVER), Eurasian milfoil, sea lamprey, some species of zooplankton (not sure which or how common they are), European honeybees, goldenrod (for that matter, a majority of the wildflowers that bloom late in the summer are invasive), wild boar (in southern Ohio), and many others (these are the most common invasives or the ones I have encountered that I can recall).\n\nCOMMON fish and wildlife (there is obviously much more diversity than I can list here but these are some of the species you might see if you go to a park and walk around): whitetail deer, eastern gray squirrel, fox squirrel, ground hog, possum, striped skunk, red fox, coyote, wild turkey, woodcock, bobwhite quail, ruffed grouse, a long list of probably around 200 species of songbirds (most common being chickadees, northern cardinals, robins, titmice, trees sparrows, song sparrows, redbellied woodpecker, downy woodpecker, hairy woodpecker, pileated woodpecker, redheaded woodpecker, northern flicker, goldfinch, tree swallow, barn swallow, eastern bluebird, juncos, etc.), osprey, bald eagle, spring peeper, gray tree frog, red backed salamander, bluegill, largemouth bass, walleye, northern pike, channel catfish, cabbage butterfly, skippers, azures, etc.\n\nHopefully this is helpful, just kinda listed the ones that came to mind.\n\nEdit: Another that just came to mind is the Canada goose. It's an interesting case because, while they have always migrated through Ohio, many people would call them invasive because they didn't breed here until the 1980s when a breeding population was introduced to help with their massive overall decline. Now they are a resident species here and are extremely prominent.",

        "My focus was on Griff2wenth2's summary statement, \"cleanup was what caused the formation of CVNP\", that may also be tricky close...but is it an accurate takeaway? I probably should have linked [this](https://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/a-park-for-the-people.htm) instead where it states, \"One of the first private organizations to call for a Cuyahoga Valley park was the Lake Erie Watershed Conservation Foundation. Executive Director George Watkins felt that if valley land development continued unchecked, soil erosion and flooding would worsen and wash more pollution down the Cuyahoga River into Lake Erie. Watkins began to work closely with another politically minded individual,John F. Seiberling, who had grown up near the valley at Stan Hywet Hall. Seiberling was then chairman of the Tri-County Regional Planning Commission and later a U.S. Congressman.\" \n\nEarlier it also states this, \"Although regional parks safeguarded certain places, by the 1960s local citizens feared that urban sprawl would overwhelm the Cuyahoga Valley\u2019s quiet beauty. Early efforts to slow development focused on fighting individual projects and rarely met with success. Active citizens joined forces with state and national government staff to explore options for a long-term solution. Eventually local leaders concluded that the valley should become a National Park Service (NPS) site\" \n\nSo from my reading (please correct me if wrong), the idea to turn it into a national park was forming in the 60's though it didn't get National Park designation until later. It did, however, get national status as Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area (CVNRA) on December 27, 1974, as you alluded to.  John Seiberling was chairman of the Tri-County Commission between 1964-1970 per his [congressional bio](http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=S000230). It seems to me the river burning at the end of his commission term and the subsequent Clean Water act and Sieberling's election to congress contributed, but the idea was already there.",

Manure and other byproducts of animal production, if not carefully managed, will have a significant negative impact on the environment. Agricultural production has been identified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as the largest single contributor to water quality impairment for rivers and lakes.\n\nNotice they say, \"agricultural production\" and not \"livestock production\". In case you're not familiar with the Ohio area, every year Lake Erie sees a runoff of fertilizer from the Miami watershed that absolutely kills the lake. Huge algal blooms and massive wildlife die off.\n\nThat is all due to crop cultivation. So crops are not free from these effects.\n\nHere is another thing to consider, vast areas of the midwest are best suited for crowing corn. Most of that is fed to animals, which leads to inefficiency in energy usage, of course, but that is largely offset by the huge efficiency gain in growing corn to begin with. Essentially, growing food for human consumption would be unprofitable. \n\nAnd you mentioned crop rotation. Often, the best crops for rotation are animal feed such as grasses or alfalfa. This helps the farmer improve his yields and also feeds animals, with no detriment. It is very rarely the case that someone chooses either consumption crops or animal-feed. Both are often needed.\n\nI'm just saying that the whole issue is incredibly complex. Nobody has it figured out. You can argue from a morality standpoint, that is fine, but I'm not buying the environmental argument. Perhaps the numbers can be argued. Maybe we do eat a bit too much meat as Americans, but to call for the wholesale abandonment of livestock is foolish in theory and in practice.",

The resulting oxygen-poor environment favors methane-producing microbes in the sediment at the lake\u2019s bottom.\n\nAlgal blooms like this due to runoff are the cause of anoxic zones, they're just toxic to everything in so many ways. It's like an ecosystem version of cancer, of increased unregulated growth. \n\nThe runoff gives the algae an almost unlimited food source so they grow to dominate the environment and take it over, there aren't enough animals to feed on it to slow or stop the growth. The algae expands to fill the limits of it's food source, which is pretty much the whole ecosystem, then it finally dies when it runs out of food.

Researchers found 1,500 and 1.7 million of these particles per square mile.\n\nPlastic chemicals can be absorbed by the body\u201493 percent of Americans age six or older test positive for BPA (a plastic chemical).\n\nSome of these compounds found in plastic have been found to alter hormones or have other potential human health effects.\n\nhttps://www.ecowatch.com/22-facts-about-plastic-pollution-and-10-things-we-can-do-about-it-1881885971.html",

Hundreds of tons of waste were dropped into our river. A study of the river concluded that \"life [does] not exist\" anywhere on it's banks or beneath it's waters. It was so polluted that the river itself caught on fire *almost 20 times*. The last fire, in 1969, was one of the major events that led to the formation of the federal EPA. It took a while, but life returned and our river healed, mostly.\n\nToday, there are roughly 200 corporations permitted to dump waste into the Cuyahoga, despite the river being the main source of Akron's drinking water during the summers.

The air in LA was dark brown.\n\nIt was the boomers who A)stopped it and B) cleaned it up.  This made everything more expensive, as raw materials were obtained more sustainably and without harming the environment, and the cleanups cost trillions.\n\nIn the face of all of these extra costs, the public demanded living standards increase.  So freeways were made safer, cars were made safer (boomers grew up with no airbags, for example), products in general were made safer, and we still had huge demands to increase living standards.  Two cars instead of one, larger homes, etc.\n\nSo boomers did what they had to do to deal with those costs.  Mostly, they pushed them out.  Instead of the public paying for your university and making it back up in higher tax money, we made people borrow it and pay it back later.  They kept public salaries low by the promise of pensions, to be paid later.  Taxes were not raised to cover government spending, instead borrowing was used.\n\nNo one was going to accept that you couldn't pay for trillions of dollars of environmental costs and not have a higher standard of living.

I remember one time, before I knew how to properly swim, I was testing how far out I could go, until I was just reaching my toes to try to touch the bottom and keep my mouth above water, staying as still as I could so as not to lose my footing. I couldn't get anyone of my family's attention, and I was starting to lose my footing in the sand. Right before my head went under a cousin came and grabbed my hand and pulled me in. I'm confident she didn't think anything of it, we didn't say anything about it at the time. Later that day I remember telling my siblings that I almost drowned, but they told me they didn't see any of the signs they saw on TV when people are drowning, flailing about and screaming and such. It wasn't until a few years ago that I read what it actually looks like when kids drown that I realized those were the exact symptoms I was exhibiting.

On page 3-37 of the draft report it says:\n \n\u201cThis 39% reduction from baseline conditions is lower than the reductions necessary for Long Branch and Upper Accotink Creek due to the 47% trapping efficiency of Lake Accotink that was discussed in Section 3.4.7.

        "&gt; When you say \"Lake Accotink Dam has significantly surpassed its useful life\" do you mean in reference to the material condition of the dam acting as a dam or because it was intended to create a reservoir for Ft Belvoir and no longer serves that purpose? \n\nBoth are true, but I'm talking primarily about the first one. Infrastructure is built with a planned life cycle, but with tight budgets and competing interests, that often lapses until there's a catastrophic failure. Dams built in that era were usually planned to last around 40 years without major rehabilitation.\n\n&gt; And when you say \"would be better financially, environmentally\" does that take into consideration that the lake removes 40ish percent of the sediment and even if they remove it the County would be on the hook to creat BMP or BMPs to match that just to be on par with the pollution removal that is currently \"baked into\" the draft TMDL? \n\nYes, the alternative projects which would cover the additional reductions would probably be less expensive and more effective in creating biological uplift than dredging the current facility. Keep in mind that the calculated sediment reduction efficiency is reduced by larger rainfall events. With the weather regime in this area shifting towards sudden thunderstorms dropping much larger amounts of rain in a short period of time, we'll see a greater incidence of storms washing sediment out of the lake and likely reducing the sediment trapping efficiency. The impact of the sediment trapping is really more \"sediment delaying.\" When we get hit with big storms, the sediment washes out.\n\nAlso, any additional reductions wouldn't be levied on Fairfax County alone. There are several other responsible entities which have land in the Accotink Creek Watershed. Granted, DEQ hasn't yet had to reallocate required reductions for TMDLs, so it's not currently known what they'll do. \n\nOne larger facility with a similar situation is the [Conowingo Dam](https://www.chesapeakebay.net/issues/conowingo_dam). It's near the border between Maryland and Pennsylvania, so it doesn't tell us anything about DEQ, but it has important lessons about the efficacy of pollutant reduction by large dams.\n\n&gt; Also, not knowing how long you have been working on the dam, how come they didn't follow the finding of the 1982 study and build a channel to channel the bulk of water and sediment downstream? \n\nI don't have an answer for that one, but I will speculate that it's a complicated problem since it's the same way today. People have conflicting ideas of how things should be, and making drastic changes in a landscape that's existed for 40 years(as of 1982) takes a lot of political willpower and dollars. I don't envy the people who will ultimately make this decision. They're going to end up with *someone* mad at them regardless of what they choose.",

The study was performed in Aquic Argiudoll soil (Tezanos Pinto series). Four treatments were assessed on three dates of rainfall simulation after fertilizer and herbicide application. The soluble phosphorus in runoff water was determined by a colorimetric method. For the determination of glyphosate and aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA), a method based on fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (FMOC) group derivatization, solid phase extraction (SPE) purification, and ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) was employed. **The application of phosphorus fertilizer resulted in an increased loss of glyphosate by runoff after 1 day of application.** These results suggest the need for further study to understand the interactions and to determine appropriate application timing with the goal of reducing the pollution risk by runoff.\n\n",

However, simply stopping there and claiming it's evidence against global warming ignores (1) the overall trend is that US winters are getting warmer, and (2) climate change can also make these freeze events more likely as the weakened jet stream's winds in the arctic spill that polar vortex further South.\n\nExtreme weather events are becoming more common and more intense. In fact, lakes no longer freezing over in winter cause more evaporation, which in turn can lead to larger snowfalls and worse winter storms. Lake Erie stopped freezing over in 2006, which produce larger lake-effect snows like the record one just recently in Erie, PA. If it was frozen, it wouldn't have occurred as it did.",

We are working on an appeal to the sponsor.\n\n&gt;You will soon be provided with information on how this impacts your student and next steps.\n\n&gt;We will remain dedicated to our students and families.\n\n&gt;Thank you,\n\n&gt;Brittny Pierson\n&gt;Superintendent\n\nProof:\n\nhttps://m.imgur.com/a/kGke1\n\nEDIT: Im not a pot head dropout and i am actually in the 10th grade\n\nEDIT: 3:48PM \n\n**Hey everyone I'm gonna write a somewhat extended response to what I see going on as a student inside ecot. I woke up this morning the news I've been expecting for a couple months now as i'm sure many other of you have. Im a little bit scared of the near future and how things are going to be handled over the next couple weeks or so. I have decided that if ECOT does end up closing down I'm going to start attending a traditional school again something I haven't done for 4 or 5 years.**\n\n**Besides the photo above I just received this in my ECOT inbox.**\n\n&gt;Good afternoon everyone,\n\n&gt;Please see the information attached to this e mail regarding the announcement you saw about ECOT in the I Qity main announcements this morning or anything you have read in the newspaper, heard on the radio or have seen on TV.\n\n&gt;Unfortunately we were not informed about these actions until last evening. As updates are provided to staff members I'll send you updates.\n\n&gt;Mrs. (leaving name blank for privacy)\n\n**It seems that the teachers are just about as in the know with whats going on inside ecot as the rest of us. Which seems really off considering the teachers are sort of the ones who are really running the show. I will say that the people we should be targeting are the politicians on the both ECOT and Government sides who have let this escalate to the point where it is.**\n\n**Anyways, the email content a .pdf that stated the following:**\n\n&gt;What does the recent announcement mean?\n\n&gt;We have not been dropped by our sponsor. Suspension means that we temporarily have to stop educating students until issues of concern to the sponsor can be addressed. At this time, we are appealing the potential suspension.\n\n**This sort of addresses the situation a bit more, but it seems like they are ignoring this suspension as I was able to access all of my classes today and complete assignments.**\n\n&gt;When are you closing?\n\n&gt;ECOT could suspend operations as early as the end of day January 19th but we have the ability to reopen through September 30, 2018 if that were to happen. At this time, we have no set date for suspension of operations due to the appeal in progress.\n\n**This is pretty much confirming that it is entirely possible that ECOT could be done after this month. if we're waiting almost a year to be able to get back into school most students likely would have switched schools and had no intention in returning to ECOT.**\n\n&gt;How can I get my records? \n&gt;If we were to close, records will be distributed to the board office of your local district of residence. A letter will be mailed to your address on file with the address, phone number and projected date for your ability to obtain your files from that office. If you are requesting records now, please have your homeroom teacher request a withdraw form to be sent. Note: ECOT is not working with any outside agency to assist in record access or delivery.\n\n**If it does go downhill we will still get our grades and will be easily able to transition them to our next school. Standard stuff of course.**\n\n&gt;Will I get my test scores?\n&gt; If test scores are delivered to ECOT, they will be forwarded to the board office where your cumulative files were sent previously.\n\n**Overall, its not 100% yet but this is looking to be the end of days for ECOT considering every single motion they have called on trial has been denied (by a matter of LAW vapes) So assuming that they follow the trend of constant denial by the state and board this is honestly it fellas.**",

        "The actual, or \"true\" sea levels are very very hard to determine reliably. Last Year's \"New Scientist\" had a big article about this, stating very clearly, that in European ports they'd vary by as much as 1/2 to 1 meter!!!!  The problems are quite clear and as have written about a number of times. Determining a few inches of sea level rise over time, is thus largely preposterous, too.\n\nFirst, what is the solid, benchmark standard for determining sea level?  Answer?  There isn't ANY. The reasons for this are the tides, which can ebb and flow in a complex system manner because the moon and sun's alignments which determine tides are very complicated.\n\nNext, there is NO sea level possible on an absolute scale. They are always relative and comparative, which means there is no absolute sea level possible.\n\nThen, as a matter of fact the tides can be measured within a single tidal basin and embayment, but due to the changing heights of the tides, those will vary greatly. Storms and swells, esp. in winter can change the tides substantially as anyone who's been to Hawaii in the winters can see. The beach can be 20-30 above sea level and 15 minutes later, the waves can be lapping at the beach . We found this in many places in Kauai, where at the Westin the ocean depth about 50' out was shin height and about 10' later we'd be off the bottom paddling for shore because of the swells.  1 person had drowned the previous week due to those swells, right at that beach!!! That's quite frankly 3 m. of variation in sea level as well.\n\nnext, the embayment and harbour shapes CAN and DO affect the heights of the tides, as anyone in the Bay of Fundy knows. And wide bays where there are currents it also occurs.\n\nAnd not last but surely importantly, the earth is a spinning oblate spheroid. Visualize this: oceans will and do bulge at the equator which is spinning a LOT faster, than say at 40 deg. N. latitude. And this means the oceans bulge much much more at the equator than they do at higher latitudes. So sea level varies according to this factor too.\n\nCombining all of these variations, it means that sea level determination being a complex system, cannot have a simple, common, universal value at all.\n\nThus the problems of \"rising sea levels\" CANNOT even be determined within 1/2-1 m. accuracy in the European harbours, either, be it Atlantic or Mediterranean. The latter has in addition tidal seiches where the sea level will rock north to south, or east to west with the winds, as is often seen in the Great Lakes, as well. That greatly confounds sea level determinations as well.\n\nSo, frankly, sea level determinations are about as predictable as the  weather, are complex system and thus have NO absolute values, either, except being more local than anything and surely NOT universal.\n\nThose are the known problems, and given the interaction of all of those complex system parts, anything more than a general probability is highly likely to be out of the question.\n\nThus, sea level determinations, which are also dependent upon rising shores when glacial ice has melted off, as affects Lake Erie (&amp; the UK), which is still rebounding from glacial ice, steadily, yearly rising in the northern shores and dumping more and more water onto the southern, Ohio shores, as well. That has meant that the I-90 road had to be diverted well inland, because it was often flooding in Cuyahoga Co, the Cleveland area, which am well acquainted with. Plus with storms, the entire 6 lane interstate often had to be closed for days, before it was rebuilt quite some ways south of the shores.\n\nThis explains largely why sea level determinations are WAY too inaccurate and fluctuating even under the best of measuring conditions, because those are complex systems, and the variations, like the weather, completely cover up any man made or natural \"averages\" or effects.",
