They are taking your order and probably doing all the little side work like dressings, etc. they pack it all up.. they deserve to be tipped. My husband and I both have always been like that, it looks like hard work taking everyone’s complaining, running back and forth on your feet all day. Some people are very rude and insulting about tipping , if you can’t afford the tip, don’t go out to eat ! \n\nSorry to hear about your closing today, I think they’re going to start that back up in many places. I live in the north East , we have a lot of local breweries off the Lake Erie shore as well as downtown, we drove by a couple a few weeks back on our way to a football game and the parking lot was as pitiful as the stadium. These are places that are jammed packed as soon as they would open when the games at home! I don’t think there’s much butt bongo going on here unless you’re playing on the street corner, the pandemic hit the bar, restaurant, entertainment industry pretty hard here.', ""When my great-grandfather came here from Italy, he built this house for my great-grandmother. He built the walls of stones he would go get from Lake Erie. Up close you will also find beer bottles he would add as he finished drinking a beer. The inside walls, while not stone, were also built by him and it very much had the inside look of a house you would see from the Flintstones.  \n \n\nHe even had a room attached to the garage with a dirt floor that he used for storing/making wine and homemade sausages. This picture was from the early 80s after I was born (you can see me). My parents are in the middle.   \n Not sure how long the home took to build. It's even on the street named after my family for being some of the original people in the city. Fun fact, right behind the house in the woods is a small cemetery, one of the graves is from a civil war Union captain.   \n \n\nSadly after my aunt passed away, no one wanted the home and it was sold to a random how buyer who added a full second floor to it (instead of the partial second floor it had). They were kind enough to let us in one day and give them the history of it."", ""&gt; How successful are the Mounties and the Canadian military going to be when it comes to policing the US/Canada border?\n\nAlmost certainly extremely successful, though you've left out the CBSA.\n\nWhile we may share the world's longest undefended border, the geography and climate do not make it easy for people to cross stealthily. [This winter a group of illegal border crossers froze to death trying to cross the border.](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-60162500) Very few people can swim a few hundred meters, and boats are going to be very visible to anyone guarding our waterways. I've spent a fair amount of time camping, hiking, and canoeing in provincial parks, and I would have no confidence that I could survive a wilderness crossing anywhere along the Canada/US border.\n\nSo, ignoring the trek through the USA to get to the northern border, here are your crossing prospects:\n\nThe Maine/New Brunswick border south of Monument requires you to ford a river or cross a lake outside of the guarded crossings. You'd then need someone waiting for you with a vehicle unless you want to walk 50 kilometers through the wilderness. North of Monument, you're still going to have an extremely difficult time getting a vehicle through, assuming Canada doesn't simply fall back to the St. John River and guard the crossings.\n\nMoving west, Quebec just needs to guard the crossings of the St. Lawrence. The Drummondville/Sherbrooke area is physically easiest for Americans to get into, but as you mentioned the language barrier might impact their ability to blend in. There are only a dozen crossings between New Brunswick and Niagara Falls, all of which are currently guarded. Then you have Lake Ontario and Lake Erie, and unless the USCG is ferrying refugees across, they're gonna have a hard time crossing those lakes undetected(or alive), and nor chance of getting a vehicle across. Detroit/Windsor is separated again by a river and Lake St Clair. These kinds of river/lake barriers continue all the way to the Thunder Bay/Grand Portage crossing. People might be able to get across in canoes/motorboats, but are then facing tens or hundreds of kilometre walks/bikes along highways or through wilderness.\n\nThen you've got your first chunk of long undefended land border. If you're trying to cross the border there, you need to hike through at least 30km of completely undeveloped wilderness. Ford a couple rivers and cross a couple lakes. Then you better hope the roads aren't being patrolled by RCMP/CBSA/CAF, because a group of people without a vehicle out there are going to stick out like a sore thumb.\n\nNow comes the best shot for someone trying to sneak into Canada. Where Minnesota/North Dakota/Montana border Manitoba/Saskatchewan/Alberta. There are about 30 guarded road crossings along this stretch, and a dozen places you might plausibly get an off-road vehicle across. You're gonna have a real long trip to civilization if you do cross at any of these points. If you're lucky enough to cross with a vehicle, you might make it to a town/city where you can blend in within a four hour drive. On foot? Not a chance.\n\nWest of this? The rocky mountains. Millions of refugees are not going to be able to sneak across the rocky mountains. And even if they did, there's only a handful of roads that need checkpoints.\n\nThe BC/Washington border might also be a valid crossing point, but if there's a refugee crisis from the US, there's only four roads across the rocky mountains that the RCMP would need to checkpoint, pretty easy to filter out people without a SIN. Most of the unguarded crossing points would have cross the water or mountains as well. Practically no chance of keeping a vehicle, and walking the highways on foot would be a dead giveaway.\n\nNow assuming you've gotten across with a vehicle (because no one getting across on foot is actually going to manage a hike to a city where they won't immediately be outed), do you have a warm place to stay? Because winter is coming, and we regularly allow our homeless to freeze to death in all our major cities. Most of the places you could sneak across reliably have winter temperatures of -35C. Do you have a stockpile of our fancy plastic money? Cause your greenbacks aren't going to be accepted anywhere if the US collapses. Culturally, there are numerous tells, even if you think we're just northern Americans. Lastly, there is one key chokepoint travelling East-West within Canada, the [Nipigon River Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nipigon_River_Bridge), anyone sneaking into the Canadian Prairies is going to have to make their way across that bridge if they want to find somewhere to blend in where their chances of freezing to death are small.\n\nAll that said, realistically, the Canadian government will probably welcome migration of skilled Americans in the leadup to a total US collapse. [Powerful Canadians](https://www.centuryinitiative.ca/) are hungry to grow our country, and many believe that Canada is well positioned to weather the climate crisis and take advantage of the situation. Very few Americans under the median income are going to be in a position to realistically attempt a border crossing into Canada if the US has collapsed to the point where they're seriously considering it.""]"

2,1,2080,1_cleveland_and_you_is,"['cleveland', 'and', 'you', 'is', 'ohio', 'the', 'in', 'of', 'to', 'park']","[""Honestly you could spend weeks checking everything out, if you're willing to drive an hour or so south of the coast. It depends on how much time you want to spend. There's a lot more stuff in NE Ohio in particular than people realize. I'll just list my favorite notable stuff along the lakeshore, east to west, some of it will overlap with what others have said. \n\n-Erie, PA - I thought the Great Lakes Maritime Museum was pretty cool, and if the Niagara is in port (check ahead) you can get a look at a replica War of 1812 ship. That stuff (maritime artifacts, history, etc) is kind of my wheelhouse though. Presque Isle State Park is worth a drive through, they have a lighthouse and some pretty views of Erie. Erie Harbor is worth a look too. \n\n-Ashtabula County, Ohio: As someone else mentioned, hunting for covered bridges is actually really fun. Finding all of them can take hours, however. Feel free to inbox me if you want recommendations on which ones to see, or if you just want a taste, the Harpersfield Covered Bridge is about five minutes from I-90 and is one of the prettiest ones. \n\n-Madison, Ohio/Geneva, Ohio - Also mentioned, this is the wine region of the area, if you're into wineries and stuff. \n\n-Mentor, Ohio - President James A. Garfield house\n\n-Kirtland, Ohio - Kirtland Temple, the first temple built by the Latter Day Saints. About a mile off 90\n\n-Cleveland: Cleveland Museum of Art, which is probably most people's choice for the top attraction inside the city. The Rock Hall is up there too, and the Botanical Garden, the Natural History Museum, and the Cleveland History Center/Western Reserve HS are recommendable as well. Right by those is Lakeview Cemetery, which is the resting place of John D. Rockefeller, Elliott Ness, and James A. Garfield. \n\nPlayhouse Square is worth seeing a show in if you have the time, or see if they're doing tours. There are the sports teams if you have time to do that, too. West Side Market is good for an hour or so stop, fun little place and you can get you some nice food there. Others will say the Christmas Story house but I've never been there. \n\nCheck to see if the Terminal Tower observation deck is open and you can get tickets for that. Haven't been on a boat tour in forever, but see which of those are available. \n\nThere are maps to more attractions and r/Cleveland, give those a look. They have some oddball attractions listed there, like the contraceptive museum (yep that's a thing) and the money museum.\n\n-Charming lake towns worth moseying on into: Geneva-on-the-Lake, Fairport Harbor, Vermilion, Huron. The latter three have lighthouses. Within driving distance of Fairport is Painesville Township Park, which just installed a beautiful 200-foot pier out into the lake, and then further east is Lake Erie Bluffs, which is a nice quiet lake park for a walk with an observation tower. \n\n-In Sandusky, Cedar Point is a world-class amusement park as others have mentioned, and the islands of course. See Marblehead Lighthouse if you're in the area of the islands, it's a big pretty one. Others have mentioned the Edison house, which is on my list of stuff I need to do but haven't. \n\n-Toledo - Museum of the Great Lakes - Another maritime museum, this one focused more on the lakes themselves than the one in Erie, which has a War of 1812 focus. Has pieces of shipwrecks inside, including the Edmund Fitzgerald, and you can also take a tour on a steamship. \n\nI've never been to the Glass Museum or Art Museum in Toledo, both sound cool. \n\n-Detroit: Detroit Institute of Art is a must-see, probably more than any other museum on the list. Cleveland Museum of Art isn't too far behind, but Detroit's collection of paintings and the Diego Rivera murals are awesome and worth the drive from Buffalo alone. \n\nBelle Isle is pretty, give that at least a drive-through. \n\nDetroit is one of my current undertakings in terms of discovery, so there's much there I've yet to do and a lot of stuff there to see. The Motown Museum, African-American History Museum and Henry Ford are on my list, although if you're going to go to Motown, don't do what I did and drive all the way up there only to find out they've stopped booking tours for the day. Call ahead for tickets :) \n\nSo there's some things off the top of my head. I'm not sure how long it would take to see all those but several days at least. "", 'I would definitely recommend avoiding the freeway through Ohio and Western PA/NY...there are some very cool little towns throughout this whole region, as well as some scenic river drives, especially along the Ohio and Allegheny Rivers.\n\nIf you\'re looking for cities, stop in Cleveland for excellent craft beer on W 25th Street (this is the brewery district, but there are tons of pubs and restaurants that specialize in local craft beer from\nNE Ohio and all across the state/region—and yes, Ohio beer is really good stuff!) and excellent food on E 4th Street, and the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame Downtown, as well as the Cleveland Museum of Art and many others in the University Circle Cultural District. Cool off at Lake Erie beaches...Edgewater Park has the best views of the city skyline, and Headlands Beach near Mentor/Painesville is the best natural beach (think like the Carolinas, except you can see the sunset over the Lake instead of the sunrise over the ocean). Cincinnati and Columbus are both known for their excellent zoos. Short North and German Village are great neighborhoods to check out in Columbus. Cincinnati has the most impressive skyline of the three Ohio cities (and I\'m from Cleveland)...the best place to see it is across the Ohio River in Covington, either right on the shore or at Devou Park. Over-the-Rhine is a cool neighborhood to check out. In general, if you like bridges, Cincinnati and Cleveland have tons of very cool ones. Another important place to see is the Museum of the US Air Force in Dayton—it\'s quality rivals the National Air &amp; Space Museum at the Smithsonian in DC, except it has an entire ginormous hangar full of planes and two silos full of rockets, ICBMs, and spacecraft.\n\nI\'m not as familiar with Buffalo or Pittsburgh, but I can say that both certainly have worthy stops...I just haven\'t dug into them. Pittsburgh is quite gorgeous being on the three rivers, especially with all the bridges.\n\nIf you want nature, the best park in all of Ohio is Hocking Hills State Park, about an hour SE of Columbus. It\'s 3 hours away from me, but this is where I LOVE to camp to decompress and hike for a weekend! There are ginormous recess caves, waterfalls, and some of the absolute best hiking here. The next best Park is Cuyahoga Valley National Park between Cleveland and Akron. Rent bicycles to ride part of the 80+ mile Ohio &amp; Erie Towpath Trail, and then ride the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad train back to your car! See a living museum of early settlement of lands west of the Appalachians at Hale Farm &amp; Village, and see Brandywine Falls.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, I highly recommend driving US-62 along the Allegheny River...see the old growth forest in Cook Forest State Park and canoe the Clarion River along your way. In New York, the Finger Lakes Region includes Letchworth State Park (dubbed as ""Grand Canyon East"") and Watkins Glen State Park (more rocks and more waterfalls).\n\nThere are also Amish Country attractions both south (Holmes/Tuscarawas Counties) and east (Geauga/Ashtabula Counties) of Cleveland in Ohio. There are dozens of wineries all along Lake Erie, especially in Lake and Ashtabula Counties in Ohio, as well as on the Niagara Peninsula in Ontario. Ashtabula County is also known for having many covered bridges.', '1. **All Ohioans need to visit Hocking Hills.** It feels like a fantasy land, and even at 14 I couldn’t believe it was in Ohio. I hadn’t been there again until my mid 30s, and began wondering if I’d dreamt it or romanticized it because I was young. But no—it’s real! And I’ve traveled the entire country a lot, and never found anything like it. If you enjoy hiking, it’s by far the best of the state and it’s all in one little area that has so much to explore you’ll have to go back for years and you still won’t have seen it all.\n\nAfter Hocking, here is everything that falls way behind it. If you’ve seen Hocking, then you’ve seen the best IMO. The rest is important for anyone who really wants to appreciate the state and it’s diverse offerings. This is a hard state to market because it doesn’t have any particular thing that jumps out, it has a bunch of them, and these are in no particular order:\n\n2. **Cedar Point**—if you enjoy roller coasters, this is must-see. This park consistently ranks in the top 5 amusement parks *worldwide*. At least go once.\n\n3. **Museum of the US Air Force in Dayton**—this place is huge, with silos full of rockets, missiles, and spacecraft, and hangars full of aircraft. It’s exceptional enough to rival the Smithsonian’s National Air &amp; Space Museum in DC.\n\n4. **Visit the Lake Erie Islands**. Put-in-Bay is a party town at night, but is still family friendly up till the last couple trips of the Miller Ferry. Kelleys Island is a lot more laid back. Rent a golf cart or bicycles (or being your own) and spend a day exploring and enjoying the views of the Lake.\n\n5. **Explore Cleveland**—Downtown, University Circle, Little Italy, Ohio City, Tremont, and Gordon Square are great neighborhoods, and Lakewood and Cleveland Heights are very cool little suburbs. Cleveland has incredible cultural institutions like the Cleveland Museum of Art (free!), the Cleveland Orchestra (one of the world-renowned Big Five), Playhouse Square (largest theater district in the US besides NYC’s Lincoln Center), the Cleveland Botanical Gardens, and the Cleveland History Museum/Crawford Auto &amp; Aviation Museum. Cleveland has a rich history and has seen a lot of renaissance in the last 10-20 years. It was known as America’s “Sixth City” since it spent a lot of time as the 6th largest in the country. A lot of its best cultural institutions remain, and some neighborhoods have been revitalized to have bustling nightlife and really beautiful urban parks. If you haven’t visited, it’s well worthwhile to see a mix of different urban environments from Downtown, which has stood in for NYC in Hollywood productions, to Little Italy, which feels so charming you can’t believe you’re still in Cleveland. If you like architecture, Cleveland has a lot of character from the skyscrapers and bridges downtown to the fancy neighborhoods around Edgewater Park and the museums around University Circle. There’s a lot more here than just the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame.\n\n6. **Explore Cincinnati**—I will yield to someone who knows more about the city because I haven’t explored it anywhere near as much as it deserves. The riverfront here is very unique, with a beautiful riverwalk complete with riverboats and some very cool bridges. Cincinnati is another old great American city. It’s got a lot of geographic layers to it too...since it’s not on terrain that’s as flat as Columbus or even as flat as Cleveland. This creates exceptional views of the state’s most beautiful skyline. It also has a great market district just north of Downtown as well as a number of college neighborhoods, museums, and great breweries. Cincinnati is also full of some great architecture.\n\n7. **Go to a county fair**—especially if it’s the Lorain County Fair in Wellington or the Canfield Fair near Youngstown. The animals are cool to see, the food vendors are fun to try, and the tractor pulls and demolition derbies at the Lorain County Fair are fantastically entertaining.\n\n8. **Check out the small cities and small towns**—Ohio has so many beautiful little towns that it’s hard to believe! On your treks across the state to visit some of the things above, get off the freeways and drive through some of these places. Often you can find some unique shops, restaurants, or ice cream stands. Some have a college or two that adds an interesting vibe. Some suggestions: Delaware, Medina, Mt. Vernon, Athens, Oberlin, Yellow Springs, Zanesville, Chardon, Wooster...and I’m sure there are plenty more. You probably don’t need to go far to find some near you.\n\n9. **See an event at Blossom Music Center that’s put on by the Cleveland Orchestra.** Yes, they have rock concerts here, but it’s a completely different experience to see the Cleveland Orchestra, the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra, of Yo Yo Ma there. It’s set amid a beautiful forest in the middle of the Cuyahoga Valley National Park, and it has acoustics that were designed for orchestral performances. It’s awesome even on the lawn, where you can set up your folding chairs or picnic blankets and drink whatever wine you chose to bring. I think it has to be one of the most underrated activities in the entire Midwest. You don’t even have to be a huge classical music fan—they have shows where the orchestra plays the score live to films like Star Wars.\n\n10. **Ride the Ohio &amp; Erie Towpath Trail through Cuyahoga Valley National Park.** This is a great experience to commune with nature and the early settlement and industrialization of Ohio. The entire trail extends over 80 miles and will eventually stretch from Lake Erie in Downtown Cleveland to Dover/New Philly on the edge of Ohio’s Amish Country. In CVNP, you can ride your bike in one direction on the Towpath and then ride the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad back to where you started.\n\n**Some other things worth mentioning:**\nColumbus: Explore Short North, the riverfront Downtown, German Village, and the OSU campus. I’ve heard great things about the Columbus and Cincinnati Zoos. Check out Mid-Ohio: Mohican State Park, Malabar Farm, Mansfield Reformatory, Kingwood Center, and more. Take a hike or get tickets for Hale Farm &amp; Village in Cuyahoga Valley National Park. Visit the Great Lakes Medieval Faire or the Ohio Renaissance Festival. Go camping in a state park, go on a hay ride, go pick apples at an orchard and drink hot cider. Explore Ohio Wine Country up along Lake Erie east of Cleveland. Tour the covered bridges of Ashtabula County. Visit Clifton Gorge, John Bryan State Park, and Glen Helen in Yellow Springs. Eat the ice cream: Mitchell’s, Jeni’s, Toft’s, Honey Hut, Tom’s Ice Cream Bowl, and a zillion more all over the state. And definitely try the craft beer wherever you go if you’re into that sort of thing! Ohio has fantastic craft beer.']"

Even the most starry-eyed proponents of government planning concede that the poisoning of Lake Baikal in the Soviet Union is a monument to heedless industrial pollution of a valuable natural resource. But there is far more to the problem than that. Note, for example, the two crucial areas in which pollution has become an important problem: the air and the waterways, particularly the rivers. But these are precisely two of the vital areas in society in which private property has not been permitted to function.\n\nFirst, the rivers. The rivers, and the oceans too, are generally owned by the government; private property, certainly complete private property, has not been permitted in the water. In essence, then, government owns the rivers. But government ownership is not true ownership, because the government officials, while able to control the resource cannot themselves reap their capital value on the market. Government officials cannot sell the rivers or sell stock in them. Hence, they have no economic incentive to preserve the purity and value of the rivers. Rivers are, then, in the economic sense, ""unowned""; therefore government officials have permitted their corruption and pollution. Anyone has been able to dump polluting garbage and wastes in the waters. But consider what would happen if private firms were able to own the rivers and the lakes. If a private firm owned Lake Erie, for example, then anyone dumping garbage in the lake would be promptly sued in the courts for their aggression against private property and would be forced by the courts to pay damages and to cease and desist from any further aggression. Thus, only private property rights will insure an end to pollution — invasion of resources. Only because the rivers are unowned is there no owner to rise up and defend his precious resource from attack. If, in contrast, anyone should dump garbage or pollutants into a lake which is privately owned (as are many smaller lakes), he would not be permitted to do so for very long — the owner would come roaring to its defense.1 Professor Dolan writes:\n\n    With a General Motors owning the Mississippi River, you can be sure that stiff effluent charges would be assessed on industries and municipalities along its banks, and that the water would be kept clean enough to maximize revenues from leases granted to firms seeking rights to drinking water, recreation, and commercial fishing.2\n\nIf government as owner has allowed the pollution of the rivers, government has also been the single major active polluter, especially in its role as municipal sewage disposer. There already exist low-cost chemical toilets which can burn off sewage without polluting air, ground, or water; but who will invest in chemical toilets when local governments will dispose of sewage free to their customers?\n\nThis example points up a problem similar to the case of the stunting of aquaculture technology by the absence of private property: if governments as owners of the rivers permit pollution of water, then industrial technology will — and has — become a water-polluting technology. If production processes are allowed to pollute the rivers unchecked by their owners, then that is the sort of production technology we will have.\n\nIf the problem of water pollution can be cured by private property rights in water, how about air pollution? How can libertarians possibly come up with a solution for this grievous problem? Surely, there can\'t be private property in the air? But the answer is: yes, there can. We have already seen how radio and TV frequencies can be privately owned. So could channels for airlines. Commercial airline routes, for example, could be privately owned; there is no need for a Civil Aeronautics Board to parcel out — and restrict — routes between various cities. But in the case of air pollution we are dealing not so much with private property in the air as with protecting private property in one\'s lungs, fields, and orchards. The vital fact about air pollution is that the polluter sends unwanted and unbidden pollutants — from smoke to nuclear radiation to sulfur oxides — through the air and into the lungs of innocent victims, as well as onto their material property. All such emanations which injure person or property constitute aggression against the private property of the victims. Air pollution, after all, is just as much aggression as committing arson against another\'s property or injuring him physically. Air pollution that injures others is aggression pure and simple. The major function of government — of courts and police — is to stop aggression; instead, the government has failed in this task and has failed grievously to exercise its defense function against air pollution.\n\nIt is important to realize that this failure has not been a question purely of ignorance, a simple time lag between recognizing a new technological problem and facing up to it. For if some of the modern pollutants have only recently become known, factory smoke and many of its bad effects have been known ever since the Industrial Revolution, known to the extent that the American courts, during the late — and as far back as the early 19th century made the deliberate decision to allow property rights to be violated by industrial smoke. To do so, the courts had to — and did — systematically change and weaken the defenses of property right embedded in Anglo-Saxon common law. Before the mid and late 19th century, any injurious air pollution was considered a tort, a nuisance against which the victim could sue for damages and against which he could take out an injunction to cease and desist from any further invasion of his property rights. But during the 19th century, the courts systematically altered the law of negligence and the law of nuisance to permit any air pollution which was not unusually greater than any similar manufacturing firm, one that was not more extensive than the customary practice of fellow polluters.\n\nAs factories began to arise and emit smoke, blighting the orchards of neighboring farmers, the farmers would take the manufacturers to court, asking for damages and injunctions against further invasion of their property. But the judges said, in effect, ""Sorry. We know that industrial smoke (i.e., air pollution) invades and interferes with your property rights. But there is something more important than mere property rights: and that is public policy, the \'common good.\' And the common good decrees that industry is a good thing, industrial progress is a good thing, and therefore your mere private property rights must be overridden on behalf of the general welfare."" And now all of us are paying the bitter price for this overriding of private property, in the form of lung disease and countless other ailments. And all for the ""common good""!3\n\nThat this principle has guided the courts during the air age as well may be seen by a decision of the Ohio courts in Antonik v. Chamberlain (1947). The residents of a suburban area near Akron sued to enjoin the defendants from operating a privately owned airport. The grounds were invasion of property rights through excessive noise. Refusing the injunction, the court declared:\n\n    In our business of judging in this case, while sitting as a court of equity, we must not only weigh the conflict of interests between the airport owner and the nearby landowners, but we must further recognize the public policy of the generation in which we live. We must recognize that the establishment of an airport … is of great concern to the public, and if such an airport is abated, or its establishment prevented, the consequences will be not only a serious injury to the owner of the port property but may be a serious loss of a valuable asset to the entire community.4\n\nTo cap the crimes of the judges, legislatures, federal and state, moved in to cement the aggression by prohibiting victims of air pollution from engaging in ""class action"" suits against polluters. Obviously, if a factory pollutes the atmosphere of a city where there are tens of thousands of victims, it is impractical for each victim to sue to collect his particular damages from the polluter (although an injunction could be used effectively by one small victim). The common law, therefore, recognizes the validity of ""class action"" suits, in which one or a few victims can sue the aggressor not only on their own behalf, but on behalf of the entire class of similar victims. But the legislatures systematically outlawed such class action suits in pollution cases. For this reason, a victim may successfully sue a polluter who injures him individually, in a one-to-one ""private nuisance"" suit. But he is prohibited by law from acting against a mass polluter who is injuring a large number of people in a given area! As Frank Bubb writes, ""It is as if the government were to tell you that it will (attempt to) protect you from a thief who steals only from you, but it will not protect you if the thief also steals from everyone else in the neighborhood.""5***\n\n\nHopefully this adequately answers your questions. I\'ve really enjoyed chatting with you. Even if we disagree, I admire the fact you were willing to engage with me, when quite literally every other comment has been disingenuous. Please maintain that curiosity throughout your life. I wish you the best, stranger.', '&gt; I get the impression that you think I reject evidence and the scientific method in my decision making. \n\nNo, you just explicitly misapplied it. \n\n&gt; The line before seems to say that you get your morality from evidence and therefore from science. \n\nScience is inferred from evidence. Not the other way around. \n\n&gt; Is that what you think about religious people or are you just being hyperbolic \n\nYes.\n\n&gt; The scientific method can determine physical facts and religion can determine moral facts\n\nThen why does religion consistently fail to do this. And I know many moral Atheists and many immoral theists. Religion is not necessary for morality.  \n\n&gt; What evidence can I show you to change your mind on this? That the prediction is for warmer winters and not colder ones.\n\nYou could support your statement. Just a thought. I\'ve already demonstrated that the quote you were relying on was referring to years, and I\'ve also provided this quote from the same article discrediting your interpretation. \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; The flip side of the question, of course, is whether global warming is at least partly to blame for especially harsh winter weather. As we pointed out in a recent EarthTalk column, warmer temperatures in the winter of 2006 caused Lake Erie to not freeze for the first time in its history. This actually led to increased snowfalls because more evaporating water from the lake was available for precipitation.\n\n&gt; But while more extreme weather events of all kinds—from snowstorms to hurricanes to droughts—are likely side effects of a climate in transition, most scientists maintain that any year-to-year variation in weather cannot be linked directly to either a warming or cooling climate.\n\nWarm temperatures in the Arctic cause the jet stream to take these wild swings, and when it swings farther south, that causes cold air to reach farther south. These swings tend to hang around for awhile, so the weather we have in the eastern United States, whether it’s cold or warm, tends to stay with us longer. So local cooling does happen even if the entire ecosystem is collectively warming. \n\n&gt; You have no basis by which to judge moral facts\n\nI certainly do. Reason is one of them. How dare you try and pretend that I can\'t be moral because I don\'t worship your cult leader. You\'re the immoral one. You\'re the one lying. You\'re the one trying to coerce your argument my misapplying known terms. And if your basis for morality really is the bible, than no wonder you think being a self absorbed megalomaniac is moral. You think humans are better than everything else. God is just the ego. Like superman, he\'s everything every believer wants to be. But that rhetoric is absolutely self centered. You\'re actually arguing that its better for every other species to die as long as we get more comfortable winters. Its disgustingly backwards.\n\n&gt; However you have no framework to this formula without religion\n\nReligion isn\'t real. Its a fiction. And again, there are moral Atheist, so you can shove this self serving garbage right up your ass where it belong. You are absolutely wrong on this subject, but I know there\'s no way to convinced a brain washed cult believer like you. But you\'ll never get me to concede on this subject when the Abrahamics have more blood on their hands than any other ideology combined. Its just complete hypocrisy beyond all reason. There literally aren\'t enough words to describe how genuinely stupid this belief of yours is. \n\n&gt; The scientific method can only give you physical facts, not moral facts.\n\nMorality is inferred from reason based on evidence. And evidence is our **ONLY** common ground. And subjectivity obeys the pattern of emergence, just like everything else in the universe. \n\n&gt; We can educate people and develop technologies that mitigate certain detrimental features. \n\nThat\'s not a solution. That\'s empty words. \n\n&gt; A tax doesn\'t really do anything but deter behavior\n\nThat\'s the point.\n\n&gt; If someone really needs to do something, like drive their car to work, your tax is not helping at all.\n\nIt helps them to drive it less.\n\n&gt; The reason that I brought up deforestation above is that plants take in CO2 as their food source. They build their plant structure from CO2. This means that trees are a carbon sink and reduce CO2 in the atmosphere. By stopping deforetstaion and urban sprawl we can curb the rise in CO2 to levels that we want\n\n71% of oxygen fixation occurs in the ocean. I agree that deforestation is a bad thing, but even if we stopped completely, our emissions wont. That\'s not a solution. \n\n&gt; No need for a punitive tax on poor people driving their cars to work.\n\nIf they don\'t want to be taxed, then they should buy electric. \n\n&gt; Things evolve to fit their ecological niche. Ecosystems don\'t simply die, they evolve to something different\n\nYes, living things *can* die. And so can ecosystems.\n\n&gt; Well we can wrap this aspect up easily if you tell me what evidence would convince you that the winters will be warmer in the future?\n\nIf you had evidence, you would be able to present it and support your argument. By not supporting your argument, all your telling me is that you don\'t have evidence. So then why would I believe you? I\'ve already seen the evidence that it is. I even have other articles lined up, but I know you\'ll just do what you\'ve already done. You\'ll find the one sentence that confirms your bias and misapply it over and over again, and remain completely ignorant to reason while you take the liberty to define the English language because you want global warming to happen. \n\nYou realize that its only Theists that are against efforts to curb global warming. Everyone else knows its a problem. Anyone can look up an almanac and see the pattern for themselves. And it really doesn\'t take that much effort to understand that if our ecosystem died, we die. Yet you still won\'t acknowledge this. You live in a completely different world than the real one. You\'re not reachable. Religion has ruined you.\n\n&gt; Do you recognize that you can\'t be consistent from one case to another? \n\nActually I don\'t because you haven\'t supported that claim. \n\n&gt; Sometimes you will advocate for killing people and other times you will be opposed to it. \n\nYou mean in self defense? So you\'re telling me that if you were on a bus and someone hijacked it with the intention of killing everyone on it, the moral thing to do would be to let it happen? People can kill in self defense. Your absolute ideal is wrong, and would lead to disaster if applied absolutely. \n\n&gt; It\'ll just depend on which direction the wind is blowing that day.\n\nFuck I hate theists. Its an ideology of ignorance and lies. All you can do is re-frame common knowledge and reflect back the criticisms that are made of you, like some convoluted fun house mirror.\n\n&gt; You seem to have admitted that you were pro-war with North Korea\n\nActually I explicitly stated: ""War does happen though. And just as its sometimes necessary to kill another in self defense, sometimes war is necessary to avert further abuses.""\n\n&gt; Your previous ""moral"" position would have killed millions of people probably, yet you felt it was the moral thing to do.\n\nTo end public executions, the government distribution of meth, and the oppression of an entire demographic that deserves to be free? Yes, it is better to kill the ones with guns holding the ones without guns hostage. This is like saying going to war with the Nazis was immoral and we should have just made peace. Germany and Japan are actually respectable nations now. But North Korea is going to hobble in poverty and corruption for decades under the Kim dynasty. \n\n&gt; Or is it possible in your view that both the hijacker is acting morally and you are acting morally by stopping him? \n\nYou\'re suggesting that someone might have a good reason to kill a busload of innocent people? In the absence of convincing evidence, I wouldn\'t accept it. Nobody should. ', 'The article:\n\nWith a vast portion of the United States coping with exceptional drought this summer, conditions are ripe in many places for harmful algal blooms, bringing additional threats to already-stressed water systems and increased health risks for communities.\n\nThe blooms are in large part fueled by phosphorus and nitrogen runoff from industrial agricultural operations, which provide a feast of nutrients for cyanobacteria — a group of aquatic, photosynthetic bacteria that grow out of control and overwhelm their ecosystems in the presence of excess nutrients.\n\nTo protect humans and animals from potentially lethal effects of the blooms, officials have closed beaches in Wisconsin and temporarily shuttered shellfish harvesting in Florida. Annual blooms in Oregon have contributed to what has become a full-blown water war at the California border.\n\nTo the possible relief of residents living in parts of Ohio, Michigan and Ontario, many of whom have come to intimately know the telltale stench and economic impacts that wash up when a toxic soup of algae blankets the water, scientists with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) have predicted a lower-than-average algal bloom in Lake Erie this year.\n\nBut a growing body of environmental health research links harmful algal blooms across the world to chronic health conditions spurred by microcystin: a kind of cyanobacteria linked to liver failure and increasingly, cancer. Some residents in downstream communities who have lived through past algal bloom-spurred water crises are still bracing for the worst.\n\nAlicia Smith is executive director of The Junction Coalition, a neighborhood organization focused on social, environmental, economic and peace education that formed in response to the Toledo, Ohio, water crisis in 2014, which left 500,000 people without drinking water. “Seven years later we still hold our breath wondering if in July, August and September we will get a notification that we can’t drink, touch or bathe in the water,” Smith told Truthout.\n\nSmith estimates that a majority of community members in her area in Toledo, known as the Junction neighborhood, were not aware of dangerous levels of microcystin in the water at the time. “We had to get football players and basketball players from our local schools to help canvas and drop off water,” she said.\n\nSince then, in an attempt to avoid another algal bloom-fueled water crisis, a new regional commission has planned to invest in improvements to its water treatment facilities, including a $100 million new water intake system and $70 million water towers, as the Toledo Blade reported. But the cost is being passed off on city residents, whom the Blade estimated would pay double the cost of 2019 water prices by 2025.\n\nFor many Toledo residents, those prices are prompting an affordability crisis, Smith said, noting that residents still worry that water flowing through the tap may be making family members sick.\n\nA Burst in Blooms?\n\nAlgal blooms are nothing new. According to a June article in Nature, Japanese explorers reported “red waters,” known now as “red tides,” as early as the year 731. But agricultural runoff from industrial farms and lawns and a lapse in limits and enforcement around nutrient runoff may be leading to bigger blooms. Research by the United Nations Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission has suggested that the harm caused by blooms strongly correlates with the growth of the aquaculture industry.\n\nThe tame 2021 NOAA prediction for Lake Erie is based in part on lower-than-average March and April rains this year, which brought minimal phosphorus discharge. Hans W. Paerl, a professor at the University of North Carolina Institute of Marine Sciences, told Truthout that, at the end of the day, the NOAA algal bloom forecast is only a prediction. After a dry early spring, May and June ended up bringing higher-than-average rainfall and with it, nutrients, such that if a significant drought were to set in, conditions could change — though drought conditions in northwest Ohio remain more moderate than much of the rest of the U.S.\n\nThe kind of extremes that the climate crisis brings makes the NOAA’s job a tough one, Paerl said, and means the bloom prediction could swiftly go awry. “If the water suddenly slows down, well then those nutrients are going to be sitting in the lake, you know, ready to support a bloom.”\n\nThrough Water, Through Air\n\n“Ohio has a very chronic problem,” Jiyoung Lee, an environmental health sciences professor at Ohio State University, told Truthout, as does much of the rest of the world.\n\nLee has been studying cancer data in the U.S. and in South Korea for the past 10 years. Together with a wide-ranging team of collaborators, Lee has found that microcystin strongly correlates with increased rates of liver cancer. In a 2020 article, the team compared cancer data from Ohio residents diagnosed with a malignant tumor between 2000 and 2014. They linked those cases to respective census tracts, allowing the team to connect a given person to their drinking water source.\n\nUsing satellite sensing to generate a list of surface water sources with visible cyanobacteria blooms from 2002 to 2011, Lee’s research team found that people whose water came from lakes and rivers impacted by algal blooms had a 17 percent higher incidence of liver cancer in comparison with those estimated to receive groundwater — a source coming from cooler and darker underground sources where algal blooms are not prevalent. Census tracts estimated to be served by bloom-impacted waters were also linked with higher levels of poverty and more likely to be coded as non-white.\n\nLee says exposure is commonly understood as occurring by sipping contaminated water, eating fish living in impacted ecosystems, or coming in physical contact through recreational activities like swimming or angling.\n\nBut exposure happens in more subtle ways too. Now, Lee is studying how the use of bloom-impacted water to irrigate crops like carrots and lettuce might also be contributing to the incidence of liver disease. The research is particularly pertinent given that 70 percent of freshwater withdrawals around the world go to irrigating agricultural fields, according to the United States Geological Survey. “We need to look at [exposure] in a more holistic way,” Lee said, noting potential links between other cyanotoxins and neurological conditions like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s.\n\nA 2020 review by Paerl found that people might face exposure to toxins in even more passive ways, by inhaling aerosol particles from bloom-impacted sources that drift off of water flowing through household faucets.\n\n“Zero Maggots”\n\nWhile there is no one-size-fits-all fix for harmful algal blooms, Paerl said; there are plenty of what he calls “non-rocket science solutions,” like leaving native vegetation to serve as a buffer between development and waterways rather than carpeting the ground with grass, and ensuring that that septic systems are not leaking into water systems.\n\nMost essential, Paerl said, is reducing the inputs that lead to algal blooms. “The knob we can tweak is the nutrient knob.”\n\nKristy Meyer is associate director of Freshwater Futures, a nonprofit focused on building political power to promote water democracy and empower residents to protect the Great Lakes. She says the Biden administration should expand which waters qualify as “Waters of the United States” — those that are protected under the Clean Water Act. In 2020, the Trump administration stripped federal protections for wetlands and streams. “I think of Lake Erie like a heart,” Meyer said. “If you cut off part of the capillaries, or the arteries, the heart starts to die. That’s basically what we’re doing when we roll back the Waters of the U.S.”\n\nA new, more expansive rule, would allow regulators to set a daily limit on nutrients for smaller water bodies like wetlands and streams, requiring industrial-scale operations like factory or monocrop operations to figure out how to decrease what they’re releasing to a certain level or face consequences. Meyer also suggests that the next iteration of the farm bill, set to expire in 2023, should include provisions requiring agricultural operations receiving federal subsidies to be subject to a nutrient monitoring plan. Existing federal law sidesteps the nutrient runoff problem, as the Associated Press reported in 2017.\n\nIncreased protections are also needed from a public health standpoint, Toledo residents say. According to the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, drinking water is safe for adults so long as it contains less than 1.6 microgram per liter of microcystin. The World Health Organization’s limit is 1 microgram per liter. No health guidelines yet exist in the U.S. spelling out safe levels of microcystin in food, a guideline that researchers like Lee would like to see established.\n\nSmith says health standards that allow for any level of a toxic substance to enter human bodies are not good enough from a justice point of view, given the legacy of health disparities that map onto race and class in the U.S.\n\n“We always have these wonderful numbers: Five [micrograms per deciliter] of lead is allowed. That’s better than, you know, 15…. But zero is the amount of lead that is safe for consumption,” Smith says.\n\nIn the same sense, Smith contends that no level of microcystin is safe for consumption, and that local, state and federal governments should work toward fully eliminating it, and other toxins, from water and food systems.\n\n“Zero maggots is what I want to eat,” Smith said.']"

These can determine whether you should get one or not. If you don't have a sidewalk to clear, I would say your Subaru won't require that you clear the snow but a few times that it gets too deep. Also consider a plow service; it is really nice to not have to worry. I am 35, in decent shape and work 9-5. I have a snowblower, but find it easier to just use a shovel. It becomes part of my workout routine, and I even look forward to it. \n\nAlso, get a push broom to clear the snow off your car.\n\nWinters here can vary quite a bit. Some are pleasantly mild and others are really severe. We tend to get in patterns that last for several days or even weeks, whether that's lake effect snow (usually in December or early January) that doesn't seem to stop or no snow at all. We don't often get huge dumps of heavy snow, usually just 2-4 inches at a time of light fluffy stuff. True blizzards are very rare; the last time we had one (I think last year or the year before), it had been over 5 years since the last one. We often have stretches where it doesn't snow for days or even weeks. The snow isn't usually the wet heavy stuff you get in Columbus, unless it's really early or late in the season. Temps are usually 5 degrees colder than Cbus, and winter starts about 2 weeks earlier and ends 2 weeks later. It's often quite grey, which I know you're used to in Cbus, but maybe more so like Cleveland, if you are familiar.

Plus, 50% humidity air \'feels\' warmer than really dry air.\n\nChange your furnace filter every 3-4 weeks.  Usually about once every 2 weeks I\'ll go through the house when the furnace is running and open every window then start over and close every window, it gets a cycle of fresh air in.\n\nYou\'ll want at least 1 throw blanket for each member of your family for the living room.\n\nPlan for at least one power outage, heavy wet snow breaks trees and they take lines down with them.\n\nFairlawn has nutty traffic from Thanksgiving to Christmas, plan on learning how to cut through the Valley and how to get to Kent without taking the expressways.  I imagine it would take the better part of an hour during the day.\n\nYou\'ll want several pairs of gloves and at least one pair totally waterproof.  Thinsulate is your friend.  Leather is nice but salt will kill it in 1-2 seasons. A heavy pair of mittens is good for snow-shoveling.  You need one \'heavy\' coat with the hood and long enough to cover your butt.  You may only need it twice over the season, but when you need it you need it.  Knit hats and earmuffs are important, too.\n\nIf you warm you vehicle up before going anywhere you *can* get away with just wearing a hoodie, but, you MUST have actual cold-weather gear in the cab for when things go wrong.  Look into a \'winter survival kit\' you can put together on your own to keep in the cab, it could be a life saver.  Keeping a blanket in the cab is nice, too, to cover cold laps.\n\nYou need icemelt / salt for your walkways around your home.  I keep it in a 5-gallon bucket with a plastic scoop, you don\'t want to handle it with bare skin without immediately washing it off, and it will ruin your gloves.  Unless you have a massive driveway a stiff-bristle shop broom (for dry/powder snow) and an ergonomic shovel (has the bendy handle) can take care of most of the average snowfall with a little work.  If it\'s supposed to snow for like 10 hours straight, it\'s easier to shovel repeatedly with smaller amounts of accumulation than to try and move the grand total all at once when it\'s over.\n\nThe coldest I\'ve seen here is -27 without the wind chill.  Just don\'t go outside.  I\'ve seen school cancelled more for cold weather than for snow accumulation, but it does happen every year.  What may seem like an insane amount of snow for nothing to shut down will get to be normal for you.\n\nWindchill is real, but only to living things.  Cars don\'t care about the \'feels like\' temp.\n\nBridges will ice before everything else, signs will be up to remind you.  Listen to them.\n\nI\'ve seen over a foot of snow in a single day many times.  Fairlawn/Akron isn\'t in the \'Snowbelt\' but we can \'see it from here\'.  Kent is in the \'Secondary\' snow belt and will likely get more snow than Akron over the season.\n\nOnce the temps drop it will be cloudy until Lake Erie freezes over, so be prepared for that as well.  You may want a \'Sun/UV lamp\' for the house since you\'re coming from AZ; it will help avoid any seasonal mood disorder issues (it\'s a real thing).\n\nIf we get snow during the day and the plows can\'t keep up with it, I76 will likely have 1 good lane on it both ways.  Stay in that lane, regardless of how slow people are going.  Getting there slow beats not getting there at all.  Merging into that lane can be tricky because of the deeper layers of snow between the tire tracks, your truck will get loose for a second, don\'t overcompensate.\n\nIt can be real easy to get going speeds you\'re used to, but nothing stops fast in snow regardless of your tire selection.  Until you have a feel for it just plan for double the normal stopping distance.\n\nThe GIANT mounds of snow you\'ll see in parking lots look like they\'re fun, but it\'s just huge blocks of filthy rock-hard ice.  Don\'t jump head-first into a snowbank.  Also those mounds will be there for a month after the weather turns nice again.\n\nI usually expect the first snow around Halloween and have seen it snow into May a few times.\n\nYou\'re living in an area with almost endless choice for food and entertainment, so that part is covered at least.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit:  I know I already wrote a book, but, you need a good long-handled snowbrush for your truck.  You will have to clean snow and ice off of it.  AND DON\'T JUST DO THE WINDOWS, get as much off the hood and top of the cab as you can (and your bed cover if you have one) so that you\'re not a menace to the people driving behind you.  Clear your headlights and tail lights as well.  This can usually be done while you\'re waiting for the truck to warm up, and also the reason why you want waterproof gloves and cold weather gear all the time.  Get the ice-melting windshield fluid, too. You\'ll go through a lot of it because of the fine salted road spray from other vehicles.']"

For a lot of reasons. One is my daughter. She is almost 8 now and started watching in 2016 with me and looks up to LeBron as a player and a person. She even did a report in her 1st grade class this past winter about him paying for kids to go to college for a “charity” unit. Having to explain why her favorite player is leaving again will be hard, but I will do it. And we’ll still be LeBron fans, even though we’re Cavs fans.\n\nAnother reason is my father. He’s in his 60s, his health is very poor and if LeBron leaves, 2016 will almost assuredly be the only title we get to see together. That’s OK, that was the most fun I’ve ever had and I am thankful I was smart enough to leave Cleveland and drive home the morning of game 7 (we were in town for game 6 and a wedding), and actually winning we both cried a little bit and couldn’t stop laughing. We stayed up until 3am watching postgame and going over the game and it was so surreal. Dad and I didn’t always get along growing up, but that memory will always be one of the best for us.\n\nIf this is it and LeBron is gone, I want to thank him as a Cleveland fan / Northern Ohio resident. Him leaving for Miami sucked, and it cracks me up when I hear the “yall burned his jersey you don’t get to blah blah” crap because unless you’re from here or somewhere like it you don’t fully get it. ALL of the best parts of our area have left, and been leaving for 60ish years now. All of the industry, the good jobs, the companies that employed the shorelines of lake Erie, everything left. We were really truly hurt, and the basketball part was just a small part of it.\n\nBUT, if he leaves now, I want to thank him for coming back and giving us some hope. Yeah, we all fully understand how good the Warriors are. I played in college and coached HS for 15 years so I understand the game a little bit and respect the hell out of what they are able to do as a team. But we always believed we had a chance (and still do, Cavs in 7!?) because of LeBron. With Bron on your side, anything is possible. 2016 taught us Cleveland fans, some of us toddlers the last time we won anything, that you don’t always have to be charlie brown missing the football, that good things can happen, and giving us hope has legitimately changed my outlook on a lot in life. Maybe I can be a better father. Maybe my girls CAN grow up in a better world. Maybe working harder than everyone else DOES pay off sometimes. LeBron returning and giving us one championship is more than he had to do. But giving us that one, with that story, is something we will all cherish.\n\nThis is getting long, sorry, I just wanted to say if this is the end, thank you LeBron. Even if a news camera finds some bitter asshole burning a jersey, the vast majority of us will wish you well and will welcome you back home with open arms whenever you want to come back.', ""I legit think that the Bills fan base is one of the largest sleeper fan bases in the NFL. Maybe not as big as the Raiders, Cowboys, Green Bay or New England, but they have to be up there.  It seemed like almost every away game this year was taken over by Bills fans and now that the team is trending in a good direction, the sleeper fans have woken up and are coming out. Yeah, officially they are one of the smallest market teams, but there is 4 things working in their favor:\n\n1. Buffalo was once one of the biggest metros in the United States, even during the second half of the 20th century, so there is a lot of expatriate fans living all over the US. The population loss has been both a blessing and a curse. Although Buffalo isn't even close to being what it was at it's peak, the city has settled into a nice size and WNYers spread Buffalo's culture  fucking everywhere.  Just go on the Bills website and look at  all the Bills Backer Bars, nearly every major city has one. It's not even just the Bills, the Sabres fans carry themselves pretty well too (maybe more so in the past then now with the playoff drought).\n2. Buffalo shares a media market with Toronto, the second biggest city in North America, but officially it is a small market team because the NFL doesn't count the people on the other side of the border who are cut off. There are places in Southern Ontario that are actually suburbs of Buffalo. People from Toronto/Southern Ontario get around the world and show up to away games just as much as people from Buffalo (maybe even more due to having a higher disposable income and direct flights from their international airport). Buffalo is like Oakland and Toronto is San Francisco (except they don't have an NFL team), the Golden Horseshoe around Niagara Falls and Lake Erie/Ontario is our Bay Area.\n3. No one really hates the Bills besides Jets fans and since the internet took off, Buffalo's fans have gained a reputation for going crazy at games. I have noticed a lot of new NFL fans pick the Bills based on stuff like the Deadspin coverage of Bills tailgates or the Bills being a true underdog. They might not ever make it out to Orchard Park for a home game but show up whenever the Bills are playing close by to where they live. Bills tailgates aren't just notorious for being crazy at home games, they bring it to away games too (ask Jaguar fans about what happened when before the 2017 playoff game). Our biggest super fan, Pancho Billa (RIP), wasn't even from here, he was from Houston and became a lifelong fan after the 1993 playoff game against the Oilers. He got caught up in all the pandemonium and hype during the 4 Superbowl years , becoming a life long fan.\n4. The Bills have been a mediocre team, stuck playing early morning/afternoon games for the past 20 years. When these games are shown over in Europe, they are airing during prime time hours. So there are a whole lot of Bills fans over in the UK and EU. We get these kinds of fans over in r/buffalobills all the time, who are asking about traveling trips to Buffalo or to see the Bills play away at a major city they are visiting. A couple of years ago I was at a hardcore/punk/indie festival called the Fest down in Gainesville, Florida. While waiting for one of the headliners to come on the main stage,  I saw a Bills jersey through the crowd of hundreds of people. I was away from home for a while and got so excited at seeing a fellow Buffalonian, I pushed through the crowd to get over to him to talk. Turns out he was some random dude from Germany that was a massive Bills fans, we were both pretty bewildered about running into each other out in the wild.  After the initial confusion, we ended up talking like we had known each other forever. Good times."", ""“You're allowed to Disagree, I  agree with about half of what you've said above from my perspective and probably 75% in principle. I'm a little bit frosty that Watson wasn't more polished in his fundamentals upon return, while supposedly working with his personal QB coach supposedly 4 day's a week throughout his suspension. Like i said, it's not the game speed that appears to be his main issue thus far.”\n\nTo me this just shows that you don’t know what you’re talking about. I’m not trying to be a dick either I just don’t know how else to word it. \n\nWhy do you think it’s so hard to play QB in the NFL? Why all these guys coming out of college look amazing on their pro day when they are throwing against air but suck ass when they play their first NFL game? It’s because they aren’t in a live game at their pro day. There’s no 300lbs nose tackle headed for their grill. It’s not like they all just suddenly forgot their footwork. In a live game situation your fundamentals will fall apart. Everything is rushed. EVERYTHING. So it shouldn’t have been surprising that he needed a few games to get back in rhythm. In a live game fundamentals are the first thing to fall apart. That and making the correct reads, going through progressions, etc. But the game is starting to slow down for him again, you can see that because his fundamentals are getting back to normal and his decision making has been much improved. \n\n\n“It's my opinion that Watson did she same thing Baker did his whole tenure here. Cockily rely on his amazing God given talents vs training the fundamentals necessary to achieve the highest levels in the NFL.  Everyone in the NFL except Demetric Felton, Tommy Togiai &amp; Harrison Bryant is a next level athlete.”\n\nAnd this opinion is wrong and based on “feeling” rather than actual documented evidence that he has done everything he could to stay in shape. If you wanna ignore all the reports about how hard he’s been training and believe that all these people are lying then that’s on you, but you’re wrong and making an assumption based on a gut feeling or whatever. But by all accounts from people close to the Browns, the people that would actually know, he’s done everything possible to keep up with the team. He studied the playbook on his time off, that’s obvious to anyone paying attention because he’s been consistently making the right reads which shows he understands the offense. You don’t make those reads at the level he’s making them if you didn’t work on it. He threw with college guys when he wasn’t allowed near the building, which is really his only option in that situation. And he continued to work with his QB coach. He did everything he could do given the circumstances. \n\n\n“This is the Cleveland Browns. I'm not saying we're cursed, but if curses exist... Well, I would like to hear arguments we aren't, in that instance.”\n\nHard to disagree here, but I think it’s more the refs hate us and less voodoo curse. \n\n“We need our players to be taking this shit seriously. We are often not just vs our opponent, but also the recipient of horrible calls at times, because the refs have no respect for our franchise and don't treat us as equals. AKA the cards are stacked against us more often than not.”\n\nWhat makes you think they aren’t taking it seriously? By all accounts everyone shows up to practice and works their ass off and when they don’t they are reprimanded (see Winfrey)\n\n\n“Again, our receivers dropped some catchable balls, but so did the defenders. At least 2 could have been picked by my count.”\n\nShow me the plays where the defenders dropped balls. This is not the case. \n\n\n“Watson has to take this more seriously than Baker &amp; I can't imagine Watson having more motivation to prove everyone wrong, on the field.”\n\nThis is the same point you made earlier, what are you basing this opinion on? Because the objective facts indicate he worked really hard to come back in good shape. \n\n\n“I think his undeniable talent will ultimately bring him back to par, but it's not par that got him a $230mil bag. I want him to live, eat &amp; breathe football till we get a ship to sail on Lake Erie. A Champions Ship!!!”\n\nAgree here. Hopefully we get a playoff berth next year. I’m not expecting a Super Bowl but playoffs are a must imo.""]"

That’s a fair question and I understand your curiosity. A lot of people have submechaniphobia for different reasons but what it means to have this phobia is that you have a fear, disgust, or are unsettled by submerged, man made objects.\n\nA lot of people don’t understand why they have this phobia but I’m fortunate enough to be able to attribute mine back to my childhood. When I was very young, my sister, some of my cousins and used to spend a lot of our summers at a campground in southern Ontario with our grandparents and near the campground was a beach off of Lake Erie. That beach had a small wrecked fishing boat sitting on some rocks about 75 metres off the beach coast which was only partially submerged beneath the water. My sister, cousins and I were always curious about it and wanted to go near it which of course was dangerous but because it was so far out, we couldn’t reach it. Well that all changed one summer when one of my cousins (who was about 12-13 at the time) swam out far enough and realized that there was a sand bar under the water as you approached the wreck which allowed you to walk in shoulder height water directly up to the boat. I was probably about 6-7 years old at the time but I was a very strong swimmer for my age so I was able to make it to the sandbar. This is when my phobia would start to be established.\n\nFrom far away, the wreck seemed cool and interesting but once you began to approach it, it was different. The boat was bigger than you thought, the hull was covered  in seaweed and rust and you could hear it creek: you could hear the water flowing in and out of it and slapping up against it. Something about that didn’t sit right with me. I didn’t want to be near this old boat anymore. When we were out there, our grandma yelled at us from the beach to come back immediately as she had just become aware of what we were doing so we all headed in and needless to say, we were all in trouble. That wreck isn’t safe for people to be swimming around.\n\nAs a method of keeping us away from that wreck she sat us all down, gave us shit and decided to scare us straight. She said that that boat will suck us in underneath and trap us if we swim near it and that it’s evil. Of course that might not be true but saying that might be a good way to scare kids away from it. Well that was it for me. That wreck scared the shit out of me from that point on and any other wreck. Not only that but any other mechanical or submerged man made objects.\n\nA lot of the irrational fears you might have in life, start when you’re a child and never really fade away. I could swim in deep water, near big fish, etc. I’m a strong swimmer and I love the water but even something as simple as a fucking pool vacuum creep me out to this very day. Submechaniphobia is the only real irrational fear that I have. I’m certain that wreck on Lake Erie and my protective grandmothers scare tactics instilled that fear in me for life.', 'Irl drowning people just disappear or look like they’re bobbing. It’s not like the movies at all. Absolutely terrifying. The guy clearly knows that all too well.\n\nGood on that guy and everyone who tried to help, but honestly it seemed like a fair few were standing around unwilling to go in for fear of the giant waves and undertow, but if they couldn’t swim then it’s better to stay out; two rescues are a lot harder than one.\n\nHope the dude turned out to be ok. He seemed VERY bedraggled and limp when he was dragged out\n\n\nI nearly drowned in a wave pool when I was like 4-5yo. And no one noticed. I could swim but got too close to the origin point of the waves and kept getting sucked back. Eventually I hung on to the edge and when the water dipped I was just hanging on there in the air. I dropped off again the first time, too weak to hang on. No lifeguards noticed. The second time thank SWEET FUCK someone saw me and lifted me out by the wrists. Lord knows where my parents were but again; it doesn’t look like you’re drowning to people with no experience. I was actually a good swimmer at that age. I was just tired and small and sucked into the undertow of the wave pool way too long. I still dislike swimming to some extent. Like I’ll waterski or whatever and swim a bit. \n\n\nI’m a decent swimmer. I had lots of lessons and shit. But I guess I still have that memory on some level. I also white water rafted and came up under the boat a lot, and had to push off upside down with my feet to let it pass over me, but it didn’t work the first few times it was a huge raft. I got most of my PADI certification done (scuba). I still love to look at what’s under the sea and scuba is different there’s no undertow. \n\nBut giant waves... I know better. Once we boated in Lake Erie and the waves were too big for a jet ski journey that day and we nearly lost someone. Boating, jet skis, swimming in large bodies of water .... all super dangerous even if you can swim. My whole fam loves to waterski, and my mom had her leg go around like a propeller and lost her ACL and was bleeding out on the lake by our cottage. Needed an air lift. She luckily can walk again now. Point is; life and water is nothing to joke about and I really appreciate that fact, and I try to inform as many people I care about as possible about how, while water is lots of fun, not to be an idiot because you don’t even have to be an idiot to drown when exposed to such a powerful element.\n\nIf even one person is a little more careful cause of these stories then I’m happy I wrote it', 'I just moved from the great lakes to the east coast ... and I\'d strongly recommend you reconsider that idea :) The storms on Lake Erie where I sailed the most are just crazy. I wouldn\'t say they are worse than those on the ocean; they are different - and they come up fast. I had a crazy experience in my little boat (a 27\' pocket cruiser) on Lake Erie a couple summers ago where I was caught out in a storm. A tornado-like funnel hit the water quite a ways from me - it turned a boat over with a family of 5 in it. I heard their distress call and the coast guard responding. I read on the news they were all saved. I\'ve seen worse storms on the ocean in terms of size and power, but nothing that moved so fast. \n\nThe bad thing around the great lakes is the winter. The lakes are fresh water and freeze over. So you only have about a 6 month season there. There are lots of sailors that made it across an ocean and died in the great lakes - they have a museum in northern Ohio about all the ship wrecks there.\n\nMy ""new"" boat is 32\' on deck, 11\' beam. It\'s a double-ender, cutter rigged. It\'s tough and built to go through hell. But here\'s something the boat salesmen never mention: most boats can handle way more weather than most sailors. You have to train - and I don\'t mean classroom training (although that\'s good too), you have to get out there and experience it. Most boaters just go out when the weather is nice, but if this is your bug-out-boat, you need to be an all weather boater. My firstmate hasn\'t been around sailing much and she is still getting used to it; this past summer we were off the coast of NJ during hurricane Irma and even though we were a long ways from real danger, the waves picked up, came around on the nose and it was really uncomfortable for a while. Even though she got seasick, she loved the trip overall and is looking forward to our next one.\n\nThere are lots of great books on seafaring - and read those - but you just have to train and get out there and try things. Do man overboard drills (with a float, not your ex-wife!). Watch out for lightening - it can take out your nav systems - always want backups for that, keep a handheld GPS in a safe place where lightening can\'t get to it. Get a water proof box for keeping extra batteries for GPS, handheld radios, etc. The SHTF with regularity on the sea. \n\nLooks like you are a DIY\'er - if you don\'t have it yet, pick up Don Casey\'s ""Complete Illustrated Sailboat Maintenance Manual"" - even if you are getting a power boat. Very little of the book is specific to sails; he talks about fixing fiberglass, wiring, diesels ... hooking up solar and wind power systems ... all sorts of stuff.  Worth its weight in gold. He wrote another great book is called ""This Old Boat"" - about restoring old boats.\n\nA pet peeve of mine with preppers is when they think they can just go buy a boat, stuff it with a bunch of stuff and they are ready. They are in for a big surprise. If a boat is going to work as a \'bug out\' vehicle, a person needs to train and train on it - and not just when the weather is nice. Just imagine a wild fire raging ... and a prepper deciding to evac via his boat - seems like a good idea, but the reality is you probably have reduced visibility with smoke in the air, and if your boat has much draft and you have to stay in a narrow channel - you run a big risk of running aground and getting trapped. A boater that\'s trained well will know how to handle low visibility (the fog in SF bay can be a challenge sometimes and a training opportunity).\n\nOne thing I recommend is always try to have a way to do things if your electric systems aren\'t working. Salt water and electronics do not get along well and there are lots of boats who have lost their electronics underway. Knowing how to use a sextant and having one could save your life. Marine radar can be invaluable in low visibility, or if you have to leave at night. But it takes a lot of power, and in my experience, it seems to break a lot - so knowing how to use your depth sounder, having paper charts and knowing how to use them is essential. If your sounder goes out? use a rope with a lead weight, with knots tied at regular intervals, you creep forward with someone on the bowsprit ... knowing how to do those things are important; hopefully you never need them.\n\nPeople whose only experience with GPS has been through google maps or a car GPS are in for a big surprise with a chartplotter. Things move around water much faster than charts are updated. Just last summer I was in upstate NY coming south through the canals headed for NY harbor; I had a narrow channel to stay in or run aground - (my boat draws 5\') - and my chartplotter shows that I\'m 200\' west of the channel in the middle of a farm field. Weather was good and I could clearly see the channel markers, so no big deal - but when if it was really foggy or lots of smoke from a wild fire, after dark, and i tried to steer based on those flawed charts?\n\nSailors become tuned to the weather. We always try to pick a good weather window when making a crossing or even just moving the boat to the next port of call. But if it\'s your escape vehicle, what are the odds the weather will be good when you need it? \n\nGreat question, good luck with it.\n\nEdit: typos and for clarity.\n']"
13,12,629,12_fish_fishing_walleye_trout,"['fish', 'fishing', 'walleye', 'trout', 'and', 'to', 'you', 'the', 'are', 'in']","['I agree with you. About trends, technique, marketing,experience, everything. Not that you asked to hear it but I want to tell you my logic behind why I’m excited about this lure. So, first off, I live in Buffalo NY. There is lots of great fishing around in Lake Erie, the finger lakes, and lots of rivers. Typically I fish 4-5 days a week, usually on my lunch break or after work for an hour or on the weekends for a morning or evening (I have a 1 year old so I don’t want to be away from him all weekend). When I fish on lunch it’s in the creeks and I do very well but those couple of outings where I can go for more than an hour I’m usually at some sort of pond/shore that is nearby. Those areas tend to be pretty heavily pressured. I catch a lot of 1-2lb LMB there but typically have to finesse them in structure near the shore. Now I know there are bigger fish around; I’ve caught them before but it’s a rarity. I know it’s not a 100% truth but the bigger the lures tend to filter out those smaller fish. Also I know that in these high pressure areas the fish tend to hold in deeper water suspended in the water column or near the bottom (especially in the heat of the summer). With this bait having a bit more weight I can cast it further than most people who are fishing around me, getting out to where the fish are holding while still keeping a nice slow finesse presentation. Hopefully it works. All those fish have been caught before on wacky rigged senkos and jigs etc. Maybe this will be something they haven’t seen before, be bulky enough to attract bigger fish, and be a straight falling finesse presentation. I’ve have some good luck throwing unusual things before.', 'The small fish aren\'t the ones breeding.  Take enough big females (in most fish, the females are larger) out of a system and you start getting declining numbers of fish.  It\'s an easy concept\n\nYou can easily find 100s of fish populations in both fresh and salt water which have been damaged, heavily reduced, or gone extinct due to over harvest. The Atlantic Cod stock off Canada for example.  Bluefin tuna.  Orange roughy.  Swordfish.  Yellow perch in Lake Erie, and the now extinct blue pike.  \n\nThere\'s nothing wrong at all with responsible harvest of fish.  I keep a few each year myself and enjoy fish dinner.  The problem is the attitude of ""I keep everything that\'s legal.""  A fat female fish full of eggs should be released.  A rare but important fish in an ecosystem, like a muskie, should be released.  Fish that\'s just going to end up getting freezer burned because you\'ve already got tons in the freezer?  Yeah, let them go.  Around here we call those people ""pigs."" \n\n  Being greedy and keeping everything just damages the resource for others.  Why would you release a fish for someone else to catch it? So they can enjoy that fish, too.  Fish populations and the rivers, lakes, streams and oceans they inhabit are constantly on the brink and if you enjoy eating the fish you catch and enjoy fishing, you need to do your part by being responsible with your harvest and preserving it for others to enjoy, too.  It\'s simple to understand.\n\nCatch and release is what most fisherman these days practice and it\'s helped preserve fish populations all over the world.  If done properly, the vast majority of fish survive with very little damage and go on to grow and breed.', ""The only lakes around here in Southern Ontario that have salmon would be Georgian Bay, Lake Huron and Lake Ontario and sometimes you will find the odd one in Lake Erie.  If you want to fish in the Lake for them before they run you would need a decent sized boat with down riggers and you won't be able to rent that type of boat so a charter is your best bet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSalmon are slowly moving in to shallow waters.  Fishing the mouths of rivers is probably your best bet at the moment but you have to time it right, the best time to go according to the reports that I've been hearing is between 2:30am-5:30am.  There will be many people at the ports because it is the season for salmon if you want your best chance at catching one you will have to deal with the crowds.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wouldn't be eating salmon once they enter the rivers as that is when they start to decay and die.  If you want to eat one make sure it's silver and small.  Larger fish will have higher PCB levels in their fat and in general larger fish don't taste as good as smaller fish.  \n\n \n\nI wouldn't use the anglers in the rivers as an example of how to fish for salmon because 80% of them will be snagging / flossing which is illegal.  This is the main reason I do not fish the salmon run there are to many uneducated people who refuse to learn proper angling techniques and etiquette during the salmon run.  I used to fish it when I was much younger but the amount of people who are blatantly snagging, poaching and have no idea how to fish with large groups of people and refuse to take your advice is staggering to say the least.  I usually wait till all the salmon die and the steelhead start running and all fair weather anglers stop fishing.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you are willing to deal with the large crowds and all the illegal activities that happen during the run make sure you are following the rules as MNR officers are out in full force.  Make sure you can identify your fish if you plan on keeping it as there are some species that have a 0 possession limit and will cost you a hefty fine.  ""]"

I always look for a beach with some rocks, too sandy means there is usually not much glass, big rocks are hard to hunt around.  So, if you can walk it easily, there are some say like playing card sized rocks and smaller. that is usually going to be a good spot.\n\nI usually hunt around Lake Erie, I drive along the roads that hug the lake and get out at any public spot I can find.  Some of them are rocky and not good for swimming/recreating, and those are the spots that are good for beach glass.  \n\nTake a kitty litter scoop and that helps sift through some material.\n\nSometimes if you stop at a local diner and chat with locals, they will tell you where some good public spots are.  But some have never heard of beach glass, (I know.....I don't understand it) so just tell them you like to go beach combing, that you pick up shells and stuff, then they will get it.   One of my best spots outside of Dunkirk NY was shared by a local that I would have driven right by because there was no signage it was a public park."", 'beach glass? i find it on lake erie all the time but this looks more rock-like than glass-like', 'It depends a lot on the conditions surrounding the body of water, what the glass looked like before it got into the water, and how long it stayed.  \n\nPersonally, I’ve only ever searched for sea glass (We call it beach glass where I live) in Lake Erie, one of the Great Lakes in North America.  I’ve found a few pieces similar to the shape in the picture above, but the majority of my pieces are the same as you stated- flat, some curved, many resembling pieces of bottles or plates.  This could be due to the fact that during the industrial era, many glass making companies dumped their glass into Lake Erie.  \n\nIt is possible that if many large chunks of glass were dumped into a body of water, over time they could form the pieces pictured above, but due to my past experience it makes me weary that so many pieces could be formed in such a similar fashion, especially with such rare colors.  That’s what leads me to believe these pieces have been tumbled.  But, there’s still the possibility that they were formed naturally, and I’m definitely no expert on the formation of beach glass.  \n\nI hope this satisfies a bit of that question for you!  I’m sure others will have insight on it, too.']"

My NDA expired years ago, so why not? 😄\n\nFor reference, Cap has always been my favorite hero. My friend found the casting ad for extras for a movie called, ""Freezer Burn,"" that was shooting in Cleveland, OH on some forum. Probably reddit, realistically. We live in the dead center of Illinois and I had just lost my job, so we decided to go to the casting. We got pulled over by a nice lady state trooper in Indiana for speeding, but we flirted our way out of a ticket by telling her we we\'re gonna be movie stars. I believe it was January at the time, and we arrived at a community College campus in Cleveland after an 8 hour drive. The weather was bitter cold, with the wind howling. People were giving up and leaving, mostly due to said wind. I would yell at them, ""What would Captain America do?! What would Cap do?!"" obnoxiously as they left the line. Partially because the line took almost 5 hours to get inside the building and partially because they were being babies and were missing out on what I knew would be a great chance that I didn\'t want them to miss out on. Once in the building, we filled out a simple form for the third party casting agency, took a headshot with a number held up, and left. Really fast process considering the wait. We drove the 8 hours back home across the northern Ohio and Indiana borders in a blizzard. We arrived home grumpy and tired early in the morning.\n\nI heard nothing for months, started a new job. A week into the new job, I get an email from the casting agency at around 12pm my time saying they needed extras TOMORROW AT 7AM. I freaked out during my training, but instantly sat down, sullen, realizing I couldn\'t go. I\'d just started, had no time off, etc. My trainer looks me dead in the eye and goes, ""Oh fuck that, you\'re going."" He called the district manager who okays some wild schedule changes, and I arrange to go with another friend and pay him to drive so I could sleep. My now wife (then girlfriend) packed my bag and my friend picked me up and off we went to Cleveland. The whole trip there I maybe got 15 minutes of sleep from being so excited. \n\nI arrived on set next to Lake Erie across from the Browns stadium and went to the wrong area for parking. Instead of going where I should, I just casually drove past the trailers for all the stars, names on the doors and everything. I was like there is NO way I am on the right spot and I don\'t want to get shot by some Hollywood elite because I KNOW WHAT THEY DID TO YOU NATALIE WOOD, so I spun around and found the right place to go. I checked in with the extra wrangler and headed off to wardrobe. We had to bring our own costumes based on a loose description of, ""Something young business people or politicians in DC would wear."" My wife had packed me 3 business suit style outfits and, somewhat jokingly, an ugly brown sweater I hated in case it got cold. The wardrobe person picked the brown sweater for me to wear. \n\nAfter this we gathered in a large white temporary tent like you see at outdoor weddings. I settled in next to some girls at one of the tables and struck up a conversation, and eventually more people joined us. We were very close to the table where the check ins happened, and we overheard everyone checking in. One dude who showed up brought a briefcase with a letter of recommendation from his drama teacher and was insisting he have a speaking line to the lady just trying to get everyone logged in. I didn\'t even hide how hard I was laughing at him and his foppish attitude. The girls and everyone else that joined started laughing after I repeated what he said. He snootily put his nose in the air and resigned himself to a different table full of us peasants.\n\nAfter a bit, we got in some vans and went up the road to a bridge overpass that we were to run away from as an explosion happened above (1:43 in the first trailer, I am the brown blurred blob on the right running the opposite direction from Scarlett Johansson). This shot took about 6 hours to get right. Scarlett would start running, we would pass her. Scarlett would run, we would run. On 15 hours of sleep, powered by only caffeine, nicotine, and the adrenaline of being on the set of a movie of my favorite hero, I ran. Again and again and again. I made a few more friends with people on set between takes. We would mix up the scene a bit every so often. One guy went from just running to dropping a coffee cup with comical style every time the ""explosion"" would happen. I think this is why they blurred us so hard. We started having too much fun!\n\nAfter breaking for a very late lunch, the shot flipped to the other side of the overpass where we all wore the same costumes. I brought this up to the extra director/on set director (The Russos were on set but they weren\'t actively in the chair at the time and spent most time I was there not on set. I saw them once for a quarter of a second later in the day). The director told me no one will notice. He was right. I\'ve never seen someone pick apart those scenes online to this day. Haha.\n\nOn the flipped shot, the bus that goes over the overpass was down and the Winter Soldier shoots down from the top at Black Widow. Scarlett did this scene running, ducking behind cars (we would just run away), and then she subbed out with her stunt double for some of the shots of her lower portion. Funny enough, Scarlett shot all of this is bright pink running shoes. Her stunt double had to wear the heels. They also made up large swaths of the choreography as they went, directing both of them at the same time for when they would switch.\n\nWe had a small break (we extras weren\'t needed for close up shots) at a nearby courtyard across from the Cleveland County courthouse (where inmates being held all watched with amazement from the 2nd floor jail cells with windows), and I made some more friends that I still talk to to this day. I was simultaneously burning to death from the ugly sweater and running while somehow also freezing to death from the windy lakefront day. I just laid in the sun for a bit. I asked the director if I could help with anything else as I don\'t sit and wait well. He decided to regale us with a story of how when they were filming in DC he snuck his nephew, a Cap fan, on set without an audition and against rules about casting just so he could be in a shot going up an escalator at... I believe it was the Smithsonian or the mall scene. I\'m not sure. It\'s been like 8 years haha. We ate it up, and apparently so did his nephew!\n\nAfter about 2 hours of sitting around, we got to film one more shot that was at the start of the hand to hand bit between Cap and Winter Soldier with a little Black Widow for good measure. We just ran away and none of us are visible, but I got to watch as the stunt doubles did some work and it was magical.\n\nThey called it after about a 17 hour on set day and I went to the hotel and was out like a light.\n\nThe next day we showed up to the tent and it was raining profusely. We did nothing but play card games until lunch. At lunch (courtesy of Marvel, naturally), the stunt doubles joined us at a table at the rear of the tent. The air got tense, as if the characters themselves were there. Eventually, I got up to get food. As I\'m returning to my seat, I hear, ""Hey, dude, nice Mass Effect jacket! Where\'d you get it?"" I turn around and it\'s the Falcon\'s stunt double. He is sitting down at his table and beckons me over. I reply, ""My ex got it for me. Thanks for bringing THAT up."" He starts laughing at my joke, then pokes the stunt double for Black Widow and says, ""See that jacket? That\'s from that game I was telling you about."" She was very disinterested but talked for a bit as well. Eventually the Winter Soldier double and Cap double join in the topic and we have a short conversation about the Mass Effect games. Not too long after I say it was nice to meet them and turn around to go sit back down. Everyone is staring at me. I mean everyone. My table of the cool friendly people... the table of foppish theater kids (there were like 6 surprisingly)... the casting employees... everyone. I slowly walk over to my table and one of the fops grabs me and low key panic whispers, ""WHAT DID THEY SAY TO YOU?!"" I reply that we were just talking about video games. He overdramatically sits in his seat fake gasping like theater kids do when the lunchlady is out of their pudding (or someone at a party doesn\'t know how to play Wonderwall. God I fucking hate theater kids. That\'s the real takeaway from this story.) and I go sit back down with the cool kids. They ask me in a less stressful manner what I was approached about and I tell them and they say it\'s cool and we go back to playing cards.\n\nEventually, the rain let\'s up and they have a spot for 5 people on set with Chris Evans shooting the same fight scene we left off at yesterday. Only 5 though. They ask whoever was in frame a lot yesterday to not lie and volunteer. I was in frame a lot so I did not go. Not lying here haunts me every day. Hahaha.\n\nAround 5pm, they call it for the rainy day and I didn\'t get to be a part of anything other than some great times at the tent. I pack it in and head home to Illinois, thrilled just to have been a part of the experience.\n\nWhen the trailer dropped at the Super Bowl the next year and I saw myself, I about cried. I love telling people I was in the Super Bowl. I don\'t give one fuck about football. 😄😄😄\n\nI\'m bad at abridged writing by the way.', 'Ok it’s a little long so bear with me. While it was an extremely traumatic event, I still consider us lucky because it could’ve been so much worse. We’ll get to that later. I’m on mobile too. \n\nSo it was Memorial Day weekend and I was off the weekend but had to work Monday night. We went up to my parents place at Marblehead, Lake Erie. We came back Monday afternoon, in time for me to get to work. I worked evenings at McDonalds as a manager while going to school for nursing. My husband had been laid off a month prior but was doing Uber and Shipt to make money while he looked for a job. So despite that we were in a good place and things were going well. \n\nAt work that night there was going to be another manager and I knew we were going to be slow so I tried calling off but my boss convinced me to go in because the other manager was still kind of new, even though she was pretty capable of doing her job. I don’t remember the exact time but it was probably around 10pm I started getting notifications on my phone about severe weather and a tornado in the area. Didn’t think much of it. The storms that hit the Dayton area usually produced tiny tornados, something that might shake the leaves off of a tree but nothing major. If anything, the storm might drop a tornado east of the are in the country, like the Xenia tornado of ‘74. I logged into Facebook because we were indeed dead at work and bored. I saw some friends reposting a video of one of the chief meteorologists at a news station basically yelling at the viewers for wanting to get back to the Bachelorette when it was an extremely dangerous situation. I try posting a link to that video later. \n\nI began texting my husband as well as got in contact with my boss. She said there’s a tornado on the ground heading east but she wasn’t sure how big it was. Around 10:45pm we kicked out the 2 customers we had (they were regulars who always came at night for coffee), and closed the restaurant down early. I went outside around 11pm to see what was going on. We knew the tornado was headed forwards the Beavercreek area but tornados will do what they want and could end up wherever. I remember it was windy and there was lots and lots of lightening. I went back inside shortly after and we took shelter in the bathroom. \n\nDuring this time, I was also in contact with my husband. We knew he needed to take cover with the children. The problem was, we didn’t have a basement in our tiny townhouse. He joked about cutting a hole in the wall under the stairs and honestly, that is something I had considered in the past when serious storms came though but never produced anything. \n\nAll of a sudden, he texts me to take shelter. He tells me he loves me and that they’re getting hit. I of course freak out a little bit, hoping that he means just rain. But I can’t get a hold of him. For 45 minutes I wait for word. I try to stay calm, hoping that the worst didn’t happen and maybe there’s just no power or something. Finally we are able to get in contact but the reception is spotty. He says we got hit. I ask how bad it was and he says you need to come home. We can’t live here anymore. Of course I’m like, oh shit, sorry coworkers, I gotta go, we’ve been hit. \n\nI call my boss and tell her my house got hit and I left for the night cuz I gotta get home to my family. I worked less than 2 miles from where I lived. It usually took me 10 minutes at the most to get home. This might it took me over 30 minutes. There were so many large trees, branches, and power lines down, plus it was dark as crap so it was extremely difficult to find my way around. My neighborhood was like 2/3 neighborhoods all connected with multiple ways in and out. All but 1 were blocked. I finally made it to that entrance (I didn’t know it was open, just luck) I parked about a block away from my house just in case my road was bad. The scene was straight out of a movie. It was pitch black but there was still tons and tons of debris everywhere. My first thought was finding my family. I knew they had taken shelter with some neighbors around the corner from us, but I couldn’t remember which house number it was. \n\nFuriously I headed to the area I thought they might be, passing my house/unit. I could barely make out the damage in the dark, but it wouldn’t register till the next day. With the power out the cell service wasn’t great but I managed to find him and my children. Some neighbors let us sit with them while the fire department made sure the gas was off and not a threat. They just had their windows blown out so their house was in much better shape. \n\nI have to get to bed but I’ll post the rest of my story tomorrow and my husbands as well since he actually went though the tornado', '1. For a bit if background. I’m on my second fiance. The first one left me and (no fault of hers in the end) had a mind of a child around 12 or so. It didn’t click until much much later. \n\nBut instagram... I figured out at a young age.. first grade.. that I wanted a girl to marry me and love me as much as I love them. Fortunately and unfortunately, I’m always told I’m very attractive in the rugged sense. Sometimes i see it, sometimes I don’t. But terrible at social cues. The instagram was a last ditch effort to find someone, so I showcased myself in as few pictures as possible in interests and how I look, and added the tags. And people would pick up on it. About 3 messaged me before her. Two of which lost interest after a while of thinking they could handle my mental problems, and the one before my current fiancé threated self harm and had self destructive tendencies all the while having an unlimited bank account. (Daughter of a middle eastern thing thats tight with the royal familes there)\n\nAnyway, she had her own problems. And she stalked me a while up until my engagement to my fiancé.\n\n2. My ex fiancé hasn’t been in my life for a while, she lives just in town. Last I know shes still working a deadend job that she refuses to work up the chain because everyone EVERYONE she meets is her ‘family’. Cheated on me multiple times which I forgave. Only ever wanted mcdonalds. Every time I picked her up or dropped her off from work was an arguement. Always left garbage piles and the room stank because she never showered or brushed her teeth, \n\nAnyway I could go on and on about how vile she is.\n\n3. I’ll list the reasons for each stay in order.\n• First was my own call. Police arrived, I just thought ‘Can I do this?’ Ex arrived as i was in the ambulance getting checked out since at the time I went a week without sleep, eatting or drinking and all I did was clean the whole time. \n\n• months later I got a message. The guy she left me for left her after 3 months. I lost my mind and destroyed my computer to ‘prove a point that I don’t need it’ I sunk thousands of dollars into it over the years. I picked up guitar instead to self teach and play grunge music. Anyway, i ran into the woods (son of a father with a large estate) called my ex’e father. He told me just to go back. So I did. Walked to the officer, apologised. Got in the car and we shot the shit on the way to the hospital.\n\n• Third was I took off to a major lake, Lake Erie, across from which is buffalo. Near the peace bridge, ran out of gas and pulled into the walmart parking lot. Just sat there. Cops picked me up. Had cuts on my legs, and i also had burns. Basicly what I did was... if you take canned duster, turn it upside down, it will freeze things.\n\nI have a large burn on the centre of my chest and three on my legs.\n\n• Another one I got tricked, I’d been smoking weed a very long time. I had money saved, and tax returns. Weed every minute every day from a bong, and a giant water bottle of half crown whiskey and half water. So what happens when youre high all the time, you get sick if you stop. Bad sick. Anyway went to the hospital bc i was told to. They checked me out. Once i saw the doors it was too late. So i just did it. Spent the night. Got up and got a free taxi home.\n\n i left to my brothers after i drove off the job. Sat and slept  on my brothers couch, never getting up longer than just goig to the bathroom. I remember the paramore album ‘after laughter’ just came out so I had that on repeat, \n\nMet my weed dealer, used to always be through my brother. He gave me free weed and expensive strands for free since I spent over 300$ on weed every single week.\n\nAfter a month i started going out at 3am bare foot and wandering around, found an old meth addict woman crumpled on the sidewalk, she asked for help, I just asked her which way, and carried her home.\n\nAnother time I accidently came across a hooker. She looked drunk, took her to tim hortons, got her a tea and something to eat, and walked her home.\n\nThen a little later my dealer drove over drunk. Was high on some kind of pain killers. I was asked to deal with him. So i brought him in, took his keys, drugs and phone, laid him on the couch and sat in the kitchen and watched him all night. \n\nThen my brother left the appartment one night after his girlfriend at the time was attacking him. He didnt come back. So it was me and her for a solid week, she’d leave for a bar in the day and come back around 6am and sleep til 10 and go back.\n\nAt that point I lost my drug dealer bc he threated to kill himself and called the cops. He didnt like that.\n\nSo I went to a pharmacy, got off the shelf drugs,\n\nSo if you get a pack of nyquil, muscle relaxers and huff lysol. You go into a psychosis, \n\nOne night i woke up and she took my lysol can.\n\nThen we got kicked out and i begged to just come home and sleep. So I did, i had to burn most of my stuff since i could fit it all in my car and really didnt care.\n\nGot home, went to my brothers old room next to mine in the basement. Set a blanket at the floor and slept on it. \n\nEvetually decided on the last resort thing, instagram. It worked, fiancé found me and it’s less than 6 hours until she gets up to take a plane from france to canada and we get married on august 1st.\n\n4. If you look up the disorders, I suffer from most if not all the related disorders linked in the wikipedia pages. \n\n5. I had some. I’ve found that the longer one is a psychiatrist, the more they stop caring and write you off and tell you what you’re feeling and thinking as if they’re not listening, \n\nThe best therapy ive had is talking to other people with mental problems, ive had people over and over come to me with their problems and told me everything. I asked one of them why they did this, I was told ‘you just seem real’ so take that as you may.\n\nCurrently my network is my wife.

Last Year\'s ""New Scientist"" had a big article about this, stating very clearly, that in European ports they\'d vary by as much as 1/2 to 1 meter!!!!  The problems are quite clear and as have written about a number of times. Determining a few inches of sea level rise over time, is thus largely preposterous, too.\n\nFirst, what is the solid, benchmark standard for determining sea level?  Answer?  There isn\'t ANY. The reasons for this are the tides, which can ebb and flow in a complex system manner because the moon and sun\'s alignments which determine tides are very complicated.\n\nNext, there is NO sea level possible on an absolute scale. They are always relative and comparative, which means there is no absolute sea level possible.\n\nThen, as a matter of fact the tides can be measured within a single tidal basin and embayment, but due to the changing heights of the tides, those will vary greatly. Storms and swells, esp. in winter can change the tides substantially as anyone who\'s been to Hawaii in the winters can see. The beach can be 20-30 above sea level and 15 minutes later, the waves can be lapping at the beach . We found this in many places in Kauai, where at the Westin the ocean depth about 50\' out was shin height and about 10\' later we\'d be off the bottom paddling for shore because of the swells.  1 person had drowned the previous week due to those swells, right at that beach!!! That\'s quite frankly 3 m. of variation in sea level as well.\n\nnext, the embayment and harbour shapes CAN and DO affect the heights of the tides, as anyone in the Bay of Fundy knows. And wide bays where there are currents it also occurs.\n\nAnd not last but surely importantly, the earth is a spinning oblate spheroid. Visualize this: oceans will and do bulge at the equator which is spinning a LOT faster, than say at 40 deg. N. latitude. And this means the oceans bulge much much more at the equator than they do at higher latitudes. So sea level varies according to this factor too.\n\nCombining all of these variations, it means that sea level determination being a complex system, cannot have a simple, common, universal value at all.\n\nThus the problems of ""rising sea levels"" CANNOT even be determined within 1/2-1 m. accuracy in the European harbours, either, be it Atlantic or Mediterranean. The latter has in addition tidal seiches where the sea level will rock north to south, or east to west with the winds, as is often seen in the Great Lakes, as well. That greatly confounds sea level determinations as well.\n\nSo, frankly, sea level determinations are about as predictable as the  weather, are complex system and thus have NO absolute values, either, except being more local than anything and surely NOT universal.\n\nThose are the known problems, and given the interaction of all of those complex system parts, anything more than a general probability is highly likely to be out of the question.\n\nThus, sea level determinations, which are also dependent upon rising shores when glacial ice has melted off, as affects Lake Erie (&amp; the UK), which is still rebounding from glacial ice, steadily, yearly rising in the northern shores and dumping more and more water onto the southern, Ohio shores, as well. That has meant that the I-90 road had to be diverted well inland, because it was often flooding in Cuyahoga Co, the Cleveland area, which am well acquainted with. Plus with storms, the entire 6 lane interstate often had to be closed for days, before it was rebuilt quite some ways south of the shores.\n\nThis explains largely why sea level determinations are WAY too inaccurate and fluctuating even under the best of measuring conditions, because those are complex systems, and the variations, like the weather, completely cover up any man made or natural ""averages"" or effects.', 'Your not being Ken M\'y are you? According to the first [Google result](http://www.lre.usace.army.mil/Missions/Great-Lakes-Information/Great-Lakes-Water-Levels/Water-Level-Forecast/Weekly-Great-Lakes-Water-Levels/) Ontario is down 22"" from last year and is going to go up an inch in the next month. \n\n&gt; LAKE LEVEL CONDITIONS\n\nThe Great Lakes water levels are all above their long-term average May levels. Lake Superior is 1 inch lower than it was at this time last year, while Lake Michigan-Huron is 6 inches above last year’s level.\xa0\xa0Lakes St. Clair and Erie are at the same levels they were during this time of year in 2017. Lake Ontario is 22 inches below its historically high monthly\xa0\xa0level from a year ago. Over the next 30 days, Lake Superior, Lake Michigan-Huron, Lake St. Clair and Lake Ontario are forecasted to rise 4, 3, 2\xa0\xa0and 1 inches respectively, while Lake Erie is expected to remain at its current level.\xa0\xa0See our\xa0Daily Levels\xa0web page for more water level information.', ""This has been a problem all through out the Great Lakes. I am curious to hear more about your situation, I like to know what's going on farther up the Great Lakes before it gets down to Niagara Falls and Lake Erie. Lake Ontario's shoreline has been up about 5-10 feet higher this year (it's been even higher than that in the past few years, hovering around 20 feet higher). A shit ton of Land along the NY Ontario shoreline has been lost due to the higher water line. It's been wiping out docks/boat houses and creating massive flooding issues everywhere. Lake Erie's level has also been up higher, I know of erosion problems along the shore line of Buffalo and Western New York too.  \n\n\nWhere I live, the lower Niagara river is also up about 5-10 feet higher and some of the landmark rocks below Niagara Falls are no longer visible. I look at the river all day long while I am at work and I have never seen it as high as it has been the past couple of years (been working at the same place for almost 10 years, plus lifelong resident). It has made some of the work my crew does harder (since some areas are submerged deeper than usual and the Falls flow rate is increased). A significant amount of water is diverted away from going over Niagara Falls and into the hydro-electric power plant reservoirs, I can only imagine how much worse the water level would be if we didn't have that ability to control the flow rate and store the excess water for later use. A bit higher up the upper Niagara river, before the the water plunges over the falls and into the Niagara gorge, some neighborhoods located along the river have had flooding problems recently.  \n\n\n Here, there is a big controversial fight about the international treaty, Plan 14, between NY and Canada. The plan basically calls for the more of the water to be contained in Lake Ontario instead of diverted downstream through the Saint Lawerence river/Seaway and along Ontario's watershed, in order to prevent the city of Montreal from getting flooded out. So people in this region have come to believe that the reason why the lake and river levels have been increasing is due to a foreign city (Montreal) can benefit at their expense.  \n\n\nBut that's bullshit in my opinion, because the water level is high every where through out the Great Lakes. It's not just isolated to Lake Ontario and it's not like all that water is getting backed up through the Great Lakes just because of Montreal. I did my final university internship with a local soil and water conservation district (each NY county has a government organization that monitors the county's soil/water health). Every single stream, creak and spring's water level  in the county that we measured was up significantly higher than it has been historically. These streams, creeks and springs are directly flowing into the Niagara river and Lake Ontario. One main reason for the increased water level, is that we are still receiving about the same amount of precipitation through out the year, but the winters have become much more milder and warmer than they usually are historically. So all precipitation isn't getting stored as snow or ice through out the winter and slowly released in the spring/summer. It's just coming right down and melting right away into the watershed. The oxygen and flow rate were also both way up, while the turbidity was down, meaning that the rate of which the water is getting released into the watershed may also be way up high.\n\nSorry for the long comment reply, I just get excited about this kind of stuff and would like to share.""]"

As a power plant operator you can draw more than enough parallels between them and Soviet-era management. (You may have heard of an incident in Ukraine.) TEPCO\'s main issues stem from weak regulation and lying. Essentially, a lot of inspections were ""voluntary"", people were not reporting issues, and the company just wasn\'t fixing problems. In 2002 *all* of TEPCO\'s reactors were ordered shut down after it was discovered that they were covering up safety incidents and falsifying reports. They had just gotten operation resumed in 2005 when in 2007 there was ANOTHER exposé on issues both past and present - apparently including an unreported loss of control back in 1978! Unfortunately this lack of accountability was not confined to TEPCO as scandals were industry-wide. This kind of corporate culture and mismanagement can just as easily cause problems with other safety concerns, such as the structural integrity of wind turbine blades, which require regular inspections and, if unaddressed, will destroy the unit and can certainly kill people.\n\nIn July 2007 a 6.6 magnitude earthquake occurred 19 KM from Kashiwazaki-Kariwa, and the effect at the site was enough to trigger an automatic shutdown. The plant was, notwithstanding TEPCO\'s lies, operating fine at that time. Of the seven reactors at the facility, 3 in production were automatically shut down, 1 in startup mode was shut down, and the other 3 were already offline for inspection. The entire facility was inspected and upgraded, with two reactors returning to service in 2009 and two in 2010. The plant never returned to full operation - following two earthquakes and tsunamis in 2011 (one of which affected Fukushima) they closed the plant forever in 2012. Kashiwazaki-Kariwa did not just randomly break - TEPCO redid a safety analysis and realized that *on the shore directly over active fault lines is a really incredibly stupid place for a reactor*.\n\n&gt; No kind of power plant runs 24/7, 365 days a year\n\nI wish I could just make shit up and get published! Can\'t we leave this to Fox News?\n\nThis is just flat-out false. Canadian power generating stations normally run continuously for *decades* on end. This is because 1. we understand the power of public ownership, and 2. facilities are engineered with redundancy in mind. Most of the large plants in the country are comprised of multiple units and the capacity is managed both internally and externally to account for planned maintenance. \n\nAs far as I can tell, Darlington NGS has been running continuously since the 2003 blackout. Multiple units inside the plant have undergone refurbishment and other maintenance since then, but overall the plant has been powering the grid non-stop for 18 years. Even on a per-unit basis it is extremely reliable: When Darlington\'s #1 reactor was shut down for maintenance this past February, it set a world record at 1106 days of continuous operation! Similar can be said for any other thermal plant: The Smog Belcher of Lake Erie, Nanticoke Generating Station, ran continuously for many years with partial shutdowns. Hydro is especially reliable because there are no complicated steam systems and they run at lower speeds. I was lucky enough to tour Hydro-Quebec\'s LG-1 facility in 2013 when they were refurbishing one of the generators - the first one since that set of units was put online in 1994. The other 11 were humming right along. Well, not humming, the place has such a deep sound that you feel it more than hear it. Very much not shut down.\n\nThis is in contrast to the ""free market"" Wild West nightmare of the United States. The US is home to many small power generating companies that only have single unit facilities. Say something like a single-boiler 200 MW coal plant. Regular maintenance at these types of plants necessitate large changes in flow across the grid as the shortfall must be made up for by distant sources. This is probably the worst position to be in between large, centralized facilities and distributed micro-generation, as capacity can\'t be managed internally and changes in current flow are non-trivial. (BTW these are all part of what caused the 2003 blackout).\n\nDistressingly we\'re currently setting ourselves up for similar problems in Ontario with the results of the Large Renewable Procurement and larger FIT projects focusing capacity in relatively large sites. My hometown has a wind project totaling ~200 MW capacity, and may get a 300 MW offshore one. I use ""may"" because, not dissimilar to Merkel\'s government screwing around, the project from the private American-owned Windstream was approved by the Liberal government, just to have that approval revoked the following year; resulting in the largest settlement to date with the NAFTA tribunal, and a subsequent application to the Ontario Superior Court to get the project moving again. So far that ""on second thought..."" the Liberals pulled cost taxpayers $28m without a single thing to show for it because they decided to privatize electricity.\n\nIf the thing ever gets built that will site 500 MW all within a few KM of each other, increasing the chances that all of that capacity becomes unavailable or significantly limited simultaneously, something that is a very real possibility with an increasingly unpredictable climate.\n\nOf course this is not an indictment of the technology itself, rather than the way in which the grid is planned and administered, which is not discussed well in the article. Wind is absolutely unreliable by its simple nature and we gain nothing by pretending otherwise, so we must plan around that. Large facilities are not the answer, nor are distant ones. Storage, while essential, can really only do so much before it becomes impractical. Overnight and day-to-day is pretty straightforward, on a weekly basis not so much. Small distributed systems with diversity in type and location are the only way that we can have great reliability with intermittent renewable sources. \n\nWoefully the authors suggest that the opposite may be the solution. Pointing to examples like the United States and vastly more densely populated Europe (Western Europe, with about 200m people, would fit into Quebec), Canada does not have a coherent national grid that additional capacity can be easily added to. We already leverage HVDC for distant transmission of large amounts of power, mostly in hydro installations like in Manitoba and Quebec. HVDC lines are cheap but the terminals are not - therefore the cost is exaggerated where intermittent/non-diverse sources are connected. It can certainly be done, but acting like it will be inexpensive or easy is foolish. Especially so since every month seems to bring unprecedented weather patterns. Alberta *historically* has a lot of sun, and winter temperatures frequently go below the lower limits for wind turbines, limiting their flexibility and casting doubt for the future. This gets worse the further north one goes and the main reason Inuit communities are stuck with diesel.\n\nWe need to be aware of challenges across an entire region. Alberta is currently experiencing a cold snap pushing their grid load to 11.6 GW, only 106 MW shy of the previous record-setter during the polar vortex in February. Tonight\'s forecast in Edmonton is a low of -32, whereas winterized wind turbines are generally only good to -30 or so. How cold it is there is made evident looking at AESO\'s quasi-realtime data: at the time I\'m writing this only 551 MW is delivered from 2269 MW worth of turbines, with many sites producing nothing at all. Backup renewable power for solar in wintertime Alberta means lots of geothermal, or electricity has to be brought in from areas far enough away that they are not affected by the same things, or a different method is possible.  Can Manitoba send 10GW to Alberta? How about BC? Will that infrastructure survive floods and fires? Calgary was not immune to this summer\'s heat dome that burnt down Lytton. It is reasonable to retain some conventional generation capacity to make up for the occasional extreme, but if we\'ve learned anything from the last two years, abnormal is the new normal, and infrastructure is more fragile than we thought.', ""&gt;We can shut down two of the six reactors at Pickering and just backfill from Quebec for a cheap option.   \n\nFirst off we have already shut down 2 of Pickering's reactors, with 2 more to go in 2022 and the other 4 in 2024.  So that will be 3GW of nuclear power gone, or more than 30% of our fleet.  Add to that Darlington is also just beginning rather extensive and long refits. The first of their 1GW reactors has been shut down since 2016 and is supposedly going to be brought back online in 2020.  I'd say Dug Ford has a better chance at winning a beauty pagent than reactor 2 comes back online anytime before 2022.  The next thing is the others are all scheduled to go offline also.  So at any given time we are scheduled to have at least 2 of their reactors offline.  That would reduce our capacity by a further 2 GW.  Bruce currently has 2 reactors offline  and 4 more to begin refitting in 2020, so a significant portion of their output is also going down.  We will need to replace that power with something.  Imports don't cut it.  Of the 37GW of capacity you talk about 13GW is nuclear and we are currently only able to run just under 10GW and that number is about to go down, significantly.  \n\nNext not all generation capacity is equal.  You do realize that we have a number of hydro plants that only run in the summer, right?  Or that much of our hydro is dependent on water levels, so there is more during certain time of the year than other times?  Hydro can't actually run 100% of the time full blast?  You do also realize that we only have about 4.3 GW of wind capacity, right?  We also have over 10GW of gas capacity.  So if we are overstocked in anything, it's gas, not wind.   You also realize that electricity is somewhat geographically limited?  Meaning when Thunderbay needs more electricity, it's not always most economical to fire up a gas plant in Ottawa?  There are also limitations on transmission lines that have to be considered.  \n\nAs for buying power from Quebec, hey why didn't we think of that instead of paying ridiculous amounts of money to refurb our nuclear fleet?  We could just buy hydro from Quebec, and coal electricity from Michigan.  \n\n&gt; If we use hydro from Quebec then why weren’t we doing that already instead of locking into 20 year contracts on new wind farms?    \n\nAnd here's the thing, I noticed you mentioned this in another reply.  Are you aware that all of the new gas plants (and they are all mostly new) also have been done by private investment, and they also have 20 year contracts?  That they also have guaranteed incomes, and that wind contracts are actually the cheapest of the bunch?  The fact is that wind also pairs extremely well with hydro, meaning while the wind is blowing the reservoir's can be refilled (think like recharging a battery) and when the wind slacks off, hydro can come online.  See when you pair the two, it takes a great portion of the variability out of the mix.  You may also may have heard about a new hydro tunnel they completed a few years ago in Niagara Falls.  The government spent a $1.5 billion, and what we got was about 3% more capacity for Sir Adam Beck.  What most people don't realize is the actual purpose of the new tunnel.  It was to ensure we had sufficient capacity for when the lake levels are lower.  I know (I live on lake Erie) the past couple of years we have had historically high lake levels, but the decade before that we had historically low lake levels, like 3 to 6 feet lower.  When we return to that, and we will, without the new tunnel, we may still be screwed hard for hydro.  So having other forms of generation is not a bad idea.    \n\nFrom your other reply:   \n\n&gt;That reduction didn’t come from replacing coal with wind farms. It came from the huge reductions in demand and job losses when corporations moved manufacturing to Mexico and China and elsewhere.    \n\nUh, most of the companies that could move to China or Mexico did so in the 90's or early 2000's, not in the past 10 years.  Manufacturing has made a small comeback in the past 10 years.  The drop you have seen is more substantially due to decreased demands through conservation than it is lack of industrial demand.  If you look at the IESO's own website, they are pretty specific in relating that conservation has been responsible for a drop in demand of 15.7TW, which is about 10%, since 2006.  \n\n&gt;We have almost twice as much capacity as demand. We could lose almost half of our grid and not worry about brownouts. Now who is making the stupid point?    \n\nAs I pointed out earlier, all capacity isn't equal, and not all of the 37GW of capacity is currently available.  A nuclear reactor that is shut down for a 4 year period still get's counted, yet provides zero electricity.  So it's actually you making the stupid point here.    \n\n&gt;That reduction didn’t come from replacing coal with wind farms.    \n\nUh, well we did bring a number of reactors from Bruce back online, so that helped. But we also produce about what 8% of our power from Wind?  That is nothing to sneeze at.    \n\n&gt;Sorry, I missed the part where the electricity is being provided for free and not being paid for by taxpayers in the form of higher electricity rates.     \n\nMy point was that the billions invested didn't come from the government's coffers, it's all private investment.  As for rates, you might want to look at the deregulation that Mike Harris shoved down our throats and see how that actually impacted our electrical rates.  We used to have Ontario Hydro that generated and transmitted all of the power to your local power company, which often was municipally owned.  So we had 2 crown corporations selling us electricity.  Now we have at least 4 private for profit companies from generation to home that all have to make a profit.  Wonder why our rates have gone so high?  Hint, it has almost nothing to do with paying $.115/kwh of wind powered electricity, versus $.133/kwh for gas powered electricity.   \n\n&gt;Strange how all new wind farms still justify their existence on their websites by comparing themselves to coal powered generation even though it doesn’t exist anymore.    \n\nYeah, strange why coal's replacement compares itself to coal.  Are you for real????   \n\n&gt;The most cost effective practical solution by far is nuclear.   \n\nOh, yes, maybe Dug will commit the $20 billion today that would be needed to build a new nuclear plant.  FFS, there is good reason why almost no new nuclear plants are being built outside of Russia, China and India, because they are expensive, and they won't deliver power for 20 years.   \n\n&gt;I’d argue the rest of your points but you’re too drunk on the green koolaid    \n\nUmm, you would have to have a clue as to what you are talking about first to even counter anything I have said.  Yes Dug Ford is an idiot, if you can't see that, it's probably because he's smarter than you.""]"

And if they’re Mayflies they can’t bite. They don’t have mouths. They hatch, they fly, they mate and they die. The males die right after mating and females drop their eggs into a body of water and then die, too. I remember as a kid growing up on the shores of Lake Erie that the summertime swarms would be so huge that they would show up on weather radars. Bigger swarms also are a barometer for the good general health of a lake or river.', 'Greetings! Former mayfly researcher here. So while mayflies are massively annoying their return to the Lake Erie area is a massive indicator of a healthier ecosystems. Their numbers are monitored by researchers across the Great Lakes to document lake and water system health. That’s one of their purposes and importance for research. \n\nSo adult mayflies only live for one or two days. They emerge from the lake as adults and flutter around until they can mate. Once they have mates they return to lakes to Lay their eggs and then they die. So the reason mayflies are attracted to light is that they think it’s the reflection of the moon on the lake and they believe they are going to lay their eggs. So you may want to keep the porch lights off for a couple of days while they continue to emerge. Also don’t wear white at night while they are emerging or they will land on you. \n\nFinally they don’t have mouths as their sole purpose in their adult state is to reproduce and then lay their eggs. Their eggs can last for years until they find ideal conditions (so there is like a massive reservoir of may fly eggs in the lakes) and they spend most of their lives as larvae burrowing in lake sediment. So that’s when they have a mouth to feed. \n\nStay strong! These are harmless but annoying! Most likely Hexagenia rigida or Hexagenia limbata.\n\nEdit: also mayfly swarm over wasp swarm motherfuckers.', ""The mayflies (also called fish flies) are a very real thing but don't let them scare you.  They fly around, they will land on you, but they don't bite.  They're just annoying and distracting and when they die they are stinky.  They tend to be around at the end of June into July and are here for two or three weeks before they die off.  I understand individual flies are not very long-lived but their season does last a few weeks. \\[Edited to add: sometimes the season for them is mostly done by Canada Day.  It's hard to predict.\\]\n\nThey are not evenly distributed around the shores of Lake Erie -- some places will have huge swarms of them while other area get almost none.  It's hard to predict where the swarms might be.  If you get a swarm in a particular spot, though, it will usually be there for the whole period that the pesky bugs are around.\n\nThey tend to be attracted by lights at night so in areas where there are swarms you will often see people turn off their outside lights at night (like the light over the front door, even streetlights and business sign lights).  They also seem to be attracted to certain colours more than others -- if you're outside in a swarm people who are wearing certain colours (I think white is one of them) will find the bugs land on them more.  They will hang around on vegetation like in bushes and trees and tall grasses, and if you disturb them by walking too close they'll fly up and all around you, often landing on you.\n\nDuring the worst swarms there have been instances where people have had to use shovels to remove the piled up dead bugs on their driveways and sidewalks.  This apparently happened in Belle River a couple of years ago (just east of Windsor on the Lake St. Clair shore) but most people can just sweep the bugs away or wash them away with a hose.\n\nThey tend to not swarm as much where there's steady wind.  We don't get very many of them where I live in Amherstburg because it's often breezy here.  They seem to get them more often in Belle River and also in Kingsville.  I'm not sure if they're much of a problem out at Point Pelee park (where you might want to go for a walk as it's a great park) because there is more breeze out there -- but that might not be true this year.\n\nThere are lots of places people go bicycling on the country roads (particularly Heritage Road between Kingsville and Colchester and out towards Amherstburg where there are numerous wineries to stop and visit) that are inland enough you likely won't encounter many of the fish flies/ mayflies except at a few spots where there is water really close like near the John R. Park homestead (tourist site).  You might get a few of the bugs along the rail trail system especially where it goes by swampy areas but I haven't heard they are particularly bad there.\n\nIt's hard to predict if there's going to be a lot of the bugs or where the swarms will be exactly as it varies each year.  They are annoying when they're here, but they are actually a sign that the local ecosystem is doing well.  If we had the bugs not show up at all it would be a very bad sign.""]"

We ate at Friday’s on the property which was good but entirely over priced. Since the park opens later than usual because of COVID, I decided to wake up early to walk along the private beach and boardwalk, to get some shots of the park and go into my first ever Great Lake, Lake Erie. \n\nOn the south side, I got some great shots of GateKeeper and Wicked Twister, and then went up past the hotel to the North end to see all of Magnum XL-200, very nice walk and great way to start my day. Speaking of Magnum, Hotel Breakers offers a unique advantage with the side gate entrance near Magnum, which we utilized, and I ran to Steel Vengeance. As a result I was the very first person in line, got back row, and this time it somehow blew me away even more than before. After this ride I knew it was my number one, knocking El Toro to #2, and Maverick close behind at #3 overall. Steel Vengeance never ever lets up, it’s hard to process the sheer amounts of element after element. It takes multiple rides to truly soak in the unprecedented amount of different forces you feel. Everything gives either tremendous airtime, hangtime, or laterals, and my personally favorite section was the outward-banked airtime hill followed by the first barrel roll. I’m happy to say that I have a new #1 coaster, and his name is SteVe, 10/10.\n\nThe rest of the day was sort of downhill. There were on and off showers 3-4 separate times, delaying operations and hindering coaster credit collection (sounds like an enthusiast bank). Nonetheless we made our way to the B&amp;M’s in the front of the park, first of which was Raptor which was supposed to only be a 45 minute wait, but ended up doubling to an hour and 1/2 wait. The queue for Raptor was very hot, but the wait was worth it. We got a ride towards the back of the train which of course offered some pretty good whip. This invert is very unique, plenty of fun and intense elements, with a decent ride duration, definitely a top 5 invert for me and probably top 5 at CP, 9/10. \n\nAfter Raptor is when Corkscrew opened for the first time on our trip, and once more we waited longer than expected, only to be rained out for the first time that day, and we unfortunately did not get the credit on our trip. Not that Corkscrew would have been that great, on the contrary, but I’ve actually never been on a classic Arrow looper so I was a little bummed out.\n\nWe got Panda Express for lunch and took cover from the rain (and I don’t think I mentioned this yesterday; but we got\nChic-Fil-A for lunch on our first day, and a sandwich is only $5! Regular price is nice to see at a park). \n\nRight after the rain stopped we got in line for Valravn which luckily didn’t take long to reopen, we waited maybe 25 minutes which was a relief. We got a front row ride, which is the move on dive coasters, but guess what...it started to rain again! This time there was no thunder and lightning thankfully so we still got on, but the rain (which was a bit more than a drizzle) was pretty painful. This was my first experience with the newer B&amp;M vest restraints and I can see why people don’t like them. Unlike S&amp;S and Vekoma vest restraints which are light and have some give to them, the B&amp;M vests are tight, heavy, and hold you right in place, which is totally unnecessary and a little annoying. The vests definitely took away some of what could have been an amazing dive coaster, but nonetheless, I had a lot of fun on it. I still prefer SheiKra, but Valravn definitely has a longer and better layout, it’s a shame about the restraints. Drop was amazing, Immelmann was good, but I really loved the corkscrew and airtime hill, solid coaster, bad restraints, 8.5/10. \n\nNext we went to GateKeeper which was long overdue. I had never been on a wing coaster so I was very excited for this, but when we got there the ride was down and the line was out the station, yet we all wanted to get on it so we waited...and waited...and after about an hour in line I decided I wanted to go to a gift shop because it was already almost 6:00, our last day at CP quickly dwindling, and I bought this nice model Parkscape of the Cedar Point Skyline for about $30, totally worth it, and the only souvenir I got at the park, but as I spent about 20 minutes there, my group was being let into Gatekeeper, and they actually got 2 rides without me. Naturally I was pretty angry, but I ran back over, luckily got on, and I must say it was such a fun ride! I sat in the 6th row on the right side of the train, and I think wing coasters are pretty underrated. I sort of forgot the the first drop was an inversion which took me by surprise, got some nice floater on the hill, crazy near misses with the keyholes, but I think my favorite element was the corkscrew before the keyholes which felt like the fastest section of the ride. On top of the ride experience, GateKeeper is one of the most beautiful coasters I’ve ever seen, and it’s the perfect way to greet guests into the park, very cool ride, and even though its tied with Valravn, I much preferred GateKeeper. Luckily, I was on the last train before it broke down again, but I got stuck on the brake run for about 15 minutes, but felt like an hour since the park close was nearing. They gave me a free ride ticket though that I hopefully can use again on my next visit. The vests didn’t bother me as much on GateKeeper so 8.5/10 for sure. \n\nThis time my friends waited for me, and I wanted to try and get on Corkscrew before the day was done, but they hadn’t had a good ride on Millennium Force the day before so we agreed to go there instead, but right on queue rain clouds returned, and we got drenched waiting for Millie. We waited about half an hour till 7:30, when we heard thunder again and knew it would not reopen. Definitely not how we wanted to end our visit, but I really can’t complain about the quality of coasters we got on at Cedar Point.\n\nWhen it comes to coaster collections, parks are either Quality or Quantity, but Cedar Point is a rare park which has both. It really is a place like no other, and I can’t wait to go back and get the rest of the credits I couldn’t get this time, especially since season passes are now good through 2021 I believe. Even though the weather literally rained on our parade, I still am so thankful I was finally able to go here, but on my next visit I will definitely buy a Fast Lane Plus, because that’s what made our next day at Kings Island so much better...

There’s actually quite a few of them along Lake Erie, but this was the first time I’ve seen one this far inland. I’m guessing it has a nest near one of the local small lakes. Beautiful and huge birds! They absolutely dwarf every other bird here including some of our larger owl species!', ""Wetlands abound and great for a multitude of species, though yes city birding is different and small patches, though, there is also a documentary about that, on New York City, in the central park there, large birding area,  even outside migration. \n\nMerlin is great for birding by ear as well, I have no experience with birdnet, so I cannot compare them, but after enough time around familiar species you get to understand the calls and what they might mean. The thrush species have such beautiful songs, and I agree, they are a wonder in summer. Every species is great to see or hear, in any time of year, from the rarities, my prairie warbler was in Ohio, a famous birding spot along lake erie, during migration, with enough birders to pass along the sighting verbally, that got passed to others on the paths, then it was a matter of finding the crowd to find the sight. At birding festivals, a few i attended, pre-covid, you walk along til find a group looking in one direction,  often its a rarity. You can follow a few folks and learn a bit of what they know, meet those what have many different experiences,  from experts, to those just starting. I've learned a lot by listening, birds and birders alike,  asking questioms of those I found out birding and helped others that were just starting. It's its own reward, feeling good about helping develop someone else's passion for birds. For the longest time I considered myself a bare novice, in identifying species, but after a bit of hotspot visits, especially during festivals, I learned I could help show the field marks of some migrating songbirds to other birders. Even have confidence in my own id of the species, where I had to keep checking my guides before. I still do that to this day but some species, you know and get used to from seeing so much!\n\nBike, hike, bird, be out there, find your passions and explore them I say. Enjoy what you do and in your own way! Never let anyway change that except you!"", ""I am absolutely not an expert by any means but there has to be some sort of environmental changes happening that are sending these birds elsewhere.\n\n\n\nI mentioned in a comment above that we now have White Pelicans that have been coming back to our area the past few years (north Ohio, along the Lake Erie shoreline), and if you look at their range in bird books or the Merlin app, they aren't native to the area. Last year we had a Brown Booby near Akron after one of the hurricanes (I do think this one was displaced by one). Last year we had a Snowy Owl come down at the beginning of November, and while they aren't totally rare to see here, seeing them in November is crazy early. The past few years we have had a few Painted Buntings up here during spring migration. There was a Northern Wheatear in the northern Ohio area early this year as well, and if you don't know what those are, they are absolutely not native to this area. We had Piping Plovers nest up here for the first time in 80 years.\n\n\nSomething is definitely going on to cause us to see birds like this more frequently. We have had a massive comeback in Bald Eagle population here and we are on a major flyway for migration, so birds are never on short supply here. It doesn't explain what is going on with sightings like the Spoonbill though. I wonder if there will be studies done regarding the movement of these birds.""]"

Lots of text incoming.\n\nI believe this was in mid July of 2019. Unfortunately, I don’t remember the exact date. I do remember that it was 11-11:30 at night. I was just about finishing up a really good meditation in my room, legs crossed, sitting up on my floor. To my right is my window, and you can see Lake Erie from it. I love to look out of this window and see the view. After wrapping up my meditation, I opened my eyes and turned my head to glance out at the sky and immediately notice a bright object hovering low over the lake. I would say it’s approximately a mile away. After several seconds, it starts going from a hover to moving from my left to right, and it accelerated quickly. The acceleration was odd, although it didn’t reach a very fast speed.\n\nI had a dimly lit LED light on and turned that off to get a better look outside. At this point, I’m assuming it’s a helicopter but I don’t hear anything. It then makes a very sharp turn towards my direction, too sharp for a fixed-wing aircraft, which makes me conclude it can only be a helicopter . But In the back of my mind I’m thinking that it might be a UFO. I then opened up my window to hear it, but it’s totally silent. This is very striking to me. Around here, it’s a quiet rural spot and you would hear a helicopter or aircraft flying that close by. There was very little wind that night, as well. It was flying low, relatively close to treetop level.\n\nIt was now headed toward my house, and it was slowed down from its previous speed. The closer it got, the more it became apparent that it was a bluish-white ball of light the size of maybe a car, but I'm not sure. There were no other lights on it. It was just a ball of light. It then flew right over my window, and I could not see a fuselage or anything physical other than light, completely silent. I would've gotten my phone - I know, i know - if I wasn't so mesmerized by it and questioning it. I'd say the whole thing lasted over a minute, maybe two minutes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain, thank you for talking about your experience on video. I think more of that would help compel others to talk about their own experience/s."", 'I lived in suburban Pennsylvania, near Lake Erie. I was in my bedroom in the summer, probably around 815-830pm and looked out the window, across the street and saw an orange light rising up over some trees in our neighbors back yard. It rose to probably 200 feet and then disappeared, like Chinese lantern or something. It looked maybe the size of a beach ball, but it’s hard to tell because it was ~200 yards away. This happened twice in a row, the exact same path. I went outside and watched it happen a third time, and went inside and grabbed my dad. He came out and saw it happen a fourth time. This was over the course of maybe 5 minutes. \n\nWhile we’re standing out there, I looked straight up and saw a disc, jet black against the dusk/night time sky. It’s impossible to say how big it was, but for scale, it was as big as if you extended your arms out all the way above your head and made a circle with your two thumbs and pointer fingers.  It was completely silent. Not a single sound. And there were no lights at all. Just a pitch black disc against the sky. \n\nIt was a little hard to see because it was nearly dark, but you could see when it would block out the stars behind it. It traveled from my right to my left in the sky and flew out towards Lake Erie. We both watched it in total shock as it disappeared over the trees to the north. \n\nWe both always believed in UFOs and wanted to see one, but it was a totally different experience than I ever expected. Just total shock and awe at what we were seeing. Disbelief even. Idk what it was, or what the orange lights were, but it’s really something that will never leave my memory.', 'I’m 46 now but when I was 13 I saw a mothership hovering over Lake Erie for nearly an hour. I was with best friend at time (also 13) and his younger cousin (she was about 7-8). We were visiting his grandma who lived on the coast of the lake about 5-10 miles east of Toledo Ohio.   We went walking on the shoreline and ended up on the small fishing pier. The sun was starting to set but still fully daylight and there wasn’t anyone else in sight just us three. There wasn’t even any boats in the water as far as we could see.  What we did see was nearly unbelievable, it was a giant round ball of white light just hovering in the sky.  It was enormous and super bright but completely silent then we saw a small triangle shape of white light fly directly into it then a couple more from another direction that’s when things got really crazy. All of the sudden the white light triangles started coming from EVERY direction!  At that point we ran back to my friends grandmas and tried to get his mom and grandma to come see what was happening.  The totally blew us off said we were making things up and told us to go back outside, we ran as fast as we could back to the pier and it was still going on but the triangles were slowing down and getting fewer and fewer until just one last straggler came shooting in.  The three of us were like wtf is happening this is crazy.  About 3 minutes after the final triangle flew into the mothership the mothership shot straight up faster than anything I’ve ever seen.  It disappeared almost instantly into space, and it didn’t make any sound whatsoever.  No sonic boom no exhaust trail just gone before we could blink.   We didn’t tell anyone what we saw just kept it ourselves.  My buddies cousin told some people over the years but everyone just made fun of her and told her she was crazy. \n There is more weirdness to the story but that happened about 18-20 years later when I was telling some friends about it at another friends birthday party who just happened to be cousins with my childhood best friend and his cousin.  I hadn’t seen her since that day at the lake when we were kids but she showed up at the birthday party about 20 minutes after I got done telling the story to my friends they all thought I was bullshitting them about the ufo’s and told me she was going to be there in a few minutes.  That’s when I was like wtf!! I hadn’t seen or heard from her since we were kids and she shows up 20 minutes after i get done talking about her.  I introduced myself and asked if if she remembered me and if she remembered that day in the lake.  Her jaw dropped open and she went completely white and said she thought it was a dream and people called her crazy for talking about it. I said your not crazy the other people are crazy for not believing you and what the three of us saw was absolutely real!   So for nearly 30 years Ive been living with the knowledge that space travel is already happening, there is highly advanced  ships that can go unfathomably  fast without a sound or any disturbance in the air.  The truth is here and maybe sooner than later it will be known to everyone.   I have no reason to lie to y’all and I don’t give a shit if people think I’m crazy.']"

Was It Stolen?\n\n36 Hours in Berlin\nHis campaign manager, Ravo Root, is a high school friend — “We were in band together,” Mr. Morgan said — who is still in college in Potsdam, N.Y., some 300 miles from the district.\n\nThe seat that Mr. Morgan is trying to win is a comfortably conservative one, most recently represented by the former senator Catharine Young, a Republican.\n\nMs. Young stepped down in March after failing to oust the minority leader, Senator John J. Flanagan of Long Island, following the party’s devastating losses in 2018. Those losses flipped Albany’s upper chamber to Democratic control for only the third time in the last 50 years.\n\nBut Republicans are seemingly not taking the seat for granted; the Republican State Senate campaign has spent $90,000 to assist their candidate, George Borrello, something Mr. Morgan sees as a sign of nerves.\n\nIf Mr. Morgan were to win, it would be a resounding upset, and perhaps reflective of how the impeachment-related developments surrounding President Trump have filtered down to local races. That possibility, Republicans say, is exceedingly dim.\n\n“George Borrello is an extraordinary public servant and we are confident he will win resoundingly on Tuesday,” said Scott Reif, a spokesman for the Republican minority in the Senate.\n\nThe race in Monroe County, where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans, may be a closer call. That Democratic advantage is also the case in Ulster County, in the Hudson Valley, where Mr. Soros’s PAC, the New York Justice and Public Safety Political Action Committee, has also put at least $184,000 behind Democrat David Clegg, who is running against Michael J. Kavanagh, a Republican.\n\nIndeed, the races in Monroe and Ulster are among the district attorney races that the Justice and Public Safety PAC has invested in, including support of the Working Families Party during Tiffany Cabán’s near miss earlier this year in Queens.\n\nBut that narrow loss did not douse Mr. Soros’s interest in local races; his PAC has contributed to five campaigns this election cycle, up and down the East Coast: In Virginia, the PAC has given $621,144.97 to the commonwealth’s attorney candidate Parisa Dehghani-Tafti, and $462,212.37 to the commonwealth’s attorney candidate Steve Descano. In Pennsylvania, the PAC has given $53,900 for research, polling and campaign literature to Friends of Jack Stollsteimer, another Democrat, in the Delaware County district attorney race.\n\nLike Ms. Cabán, Ms. Mitchell has been running on a platform of criminal justice reform and more equitable prosecution, saying that too many low-level, nonviolent offenders are being put in prison in the county. And the money being spent on her behalf, she says, is a testament to that message.\n\n“I think it’s because someone has dared to come out and run a campaign on change, on a platform that’s about seeking true justice and true safety, and that resonates,” said Ms. Mitchell, who worked under Ms. Doorley as a prosecutor in the Monroe office for several years. She added: “I had the guts to do it.”\n\nMr. Morgan’s pitch is decidedly more pragmatic, telling voters that they should elect a Democrat because that party is now in charge of both houses of the State Legislature and the governor’s mansion.\n\n“Look, Cathy Young was in the majority and she delivered: That’s how she got it done,” Mr. Morgan said, sitting in his storefront campaign headquarters in Jamestown, N.Y. “With a Democratic majority, the only way we’re getting funding, or legislation or attention from Albany is from someone who is going to be in that Democratic caucus room.”\n\nIndeed, Mr. Morgan is unstinting in his praise of Ms. Young; in accepting the nomination in March he called her “a titan of Albany,” and said he voted for her in 2018.\n\nBut he is unapologetic about his disdain for his opponent, Mr. Borrello, the Chautauqua County executive, accusing him of using “a great deal of vitriolic, divisive, hateful rhetoric in this campaign,” including calling Albany “the bowels of hell,” something Mr. Morgan says is an insult to the civil servants working there.\n\n“They are beautiful hard-working good people,” he said. (Mr. Borrello said the remark was made in jest. “My opponent has nothing else to talk about,” he said, “so he has to make mountains out of molehills.”)\n\nMr. Morgan has a compelling personal biography: He grew up on 10 acres in the small rural town of Freedom, N.Y., in a “single-wide trailer on a dirt road.” His father is a mechanic and his mother is a teacher’s aide.\n\nLast year, while still a student at Cornell, he interned in Albany with state Senator Leroy Comrie of Queens, and discovered a niche in education and agricultural policy. While he praised Mr. Comrie as “the best example of a public servant I could think of,” Mr. Morgan is more conservative than most downstate Democrats, voicing support for gun rights, for instance, and questioning elements of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s signature gun-control law, the SAFE Act.\n\nHe admits he has an uphill battle — Ms. Young defeated her Democratic challenger in 2016 with 79 percent of the vote, and ran unopposed in 2018.\n\nMr. Borrello says he respects Mr. Morgan’s precocious pluck, but believes he would do a better job of cutting bipartisan deals in Albany’s often back-room bargaining sessions than the inexperienced Mr. Morgan.\n\n“Without having a strong person in the role of state senator, so much of what we do locally is in jeopardy,” said Mr. Borrello, who was a businessman before entering public office and still owns and operates a pair of beachfront bars and restaurants in Sunset Bay, N.Y., on Lake Erie. “I’m used to being told that you’re not going to get things accomplished and then going above and beyond.”\n\nMr. Borrello does not seem concerned with any dampening effect that Mr. Trump might have on Republican prospects. “The chief executive I’m most worried about is in Albany,” he said, referencing Mr. Cuomo, “not Washington.”\n\nMs. Doorley, who was first elected as Democrat in 2011 before switching her party affiliation in 2015, said she did not vote for Mr. Trump in 2016, and called the Republicans “the party that I run on to be able to do my job,” saying district attorneys should be apolitical.\n\n“I’m really running on my record and my relationship with the community,” she said, noting drops in both local jail population and overdose rates during her tenure, something she attributes to her office’s prosecution of heroin dealers in the county and prevention efforts.\n\nThe Soros connection to the race, however, is undeniable, and one that the state Republican Party attacked, calling Mr. Soros “a radical liberal” who is “trying to infiltrate New York’s criminal justice system.”\n\nWhitney Tymas, a senior adviser for the Justice and Public Safety PAC, said their efforts in New York and other states were nonpartisan and based solely on their interests in reforming the criminal justice system.\n\n“What we’re really doing is leveling the playing field,” Ms. Tymas said, noting the inherent advantages of incumbency and often low voter engagement in district attorney races. She added that Ms. Mitchell’s focus on bail reform and her pledge to address the overcharging of defendants “aligned with our values.”\n\nMs. Doorley, who is the president-elect of the District Attorneys Association of the State of New York, said she rejected criticisms of her record, but acknowledged that the onslaught of advertisements for her opponent were a challenge.\n\n“You know what I say to my D.A.s all over the country? No one’s safe,” she said. “You don’t know why, you don’t know where, but you could be the next target.”', '&gt;  **Article:**\n\n**Start knocking on doors, Joe Biden, or you can wave goodbye to Ohio**\n\n*Trump has staunch support among rural and non-college-educated white voters in Ohio*\n\nSarah Baxter\nSunday September 27 2020, 12.01am BST, The Sunday Times\n\nThere is a saying: “As Ohio goes, so goes the nation.” No Republican has ever won the White House without winning the Buckeye State. The first presidential debate of three gets under way on Tuesday in Cleveland, the former industrial powerhouse on the shores of Lake Erie, and I’m here to take the political temperature for personal reasons. It was my mother’s hometown.\n\nIf the rest of Ohio were like Cleveland, Joe Biden would win by a landslide. Frankly, he could make a complete fool of himself against Donald Trump on debate night and still take the city. Even the swankiest suburb, Shaker Heights, made famous by Celeste Ng’s novel Little Fires Everywhere — now a Netflix drama starring Reese Witherspoon — is a Democratic stronghold.\n\nHowever, Biden needs a blowout in this, Ohio’s second-largest city (population: 380,000), to counter Trump’s staunch support among rural and non-college-educated white voters in the state. The most recent Ohio poll was effectively a dead heat, with Biden on 44.9% and Trump on 44.3%. Who is winning the ground game? The question is causing sleepless nights in the Democratic camp.\n\nI hadn’t been back to my grandmother’s house since I was 12 (she died a year later). I lived with her for a short time when I was five and remember learning to tie my shoelaces in her hall and to tell the time from the big clock on her kitchen wall. She lived in a peeling clapboard house with a swing on the porch in Cleveland Heights, now — as I was to discover — a neighbourhood for hipsters that has been thoroughly gentrified. There were at least a dozen Biden-Harris lawn signs on her old street. The one that made me laugh, though, said: “Any Functioning Adult 2020.” If Biden wins, this will be the slogan that propelled him to the White House.\n\nPerhaps things hadn’t changed as much as I thought. My mother used to say that everyone on the American side of our family was a “yellow dog Democrat” — meaning they would vote for a mangy hound over any Republican candidate. Loyalties forged in the Great Depression, when Franklin D Roosevelt was president, were passed down the generations.\n\nToday the left is more defined by cultural values. The street had just as many Black Lives Matter signs as Biden ones, though its residents were predominantly white. I stopped for a while to talk to Nolan Konkoski, the owner of a bohemian bar, Soho Chicken + Whiskey, who was on his porch enjoying the warm evening. “This community is very liberal, very supportive of human rights,” he said. His 11-year-old daughter has rejected gender norms and goes by the neutral pronoun “they”. Her local school is diverse and minority white: “That’s one of the reasons we love the area.” Unlike the private schools, it is teaching remotely.\n\nKonkoski has had to shut his bar for months and despises Trump’s attitude to “science” and his bungling of the pandemic. I asked if he would be watching the debate. “I can’t stand to listen to Trump’s nonstop bluster, but it’s such an important election we’ll probably tune in for a bit. I can’t imagine that anyone is undecided, honestly.”\n\nEven so, the battle for every last vote is going to the wire. Down the road, the local Republican office was staffed by three black volunteers. This was not my grandmother’s GOP.\n\nChairs were laid out in anticipation of a get-out-the-vote rally with some of Trump’s most prominent African-American supporters, who are rolling through Cleveland on a national bus tour this weekend. I asked if Trump might drop by ahead of the debate. “I wish,” one of the volunteers replied.\n\nBiden, to be sure, retains the overwhelming support of the black community. Alan Leigh, the black author of The Secret Code of the Scrolls, who was born in the area, told me: “Trump has opened the door to people feeling more comfortable with racist behaviour.” He is also worried about election night itself. “I believe Biden has a chance but Trump is very crafty. The election can be stolen.”\n\nFirst, however, the Democrats have to amass the greatest number of votes. Party organisers fear they are fighting with one hand tied behind their backs after the Biden campaign issued strict instructions against in-person meetings and door-to-door canvassing because of the pandemic.\n\nThe impact is difficult to predict. No party has tried to win before with a “virtual” ground game. Ryan Puente, the executive director of the Democratic Party in Cuyahoga county (greater Cleveland), said: “We’re getting creative with a lot of pop-up, drive-through events, texting and leaflet drops, but yes, I’m nervous. I’m worried that other parts of the state and county don’t have our resources.”\n\nSome elements of the campaign are whirring at full throttle. Democrats hope the enthusiasm of suburban women will give their candidate a strong boost. Monique Smart, who is running for the state legislature on the outskirts of the city, said: “These are my ladies. They used to vote Republican but are rejecting Trump’s nastiness.”\n\nA group calling itself the Bay Village Nasty Women (which derives its name from Trump’s epithet for his 2016 rival, Hillary Clinton) has taken over much of the get-out-the-vote push. “None of this is being supported by the Biden campaign. We are leading ourselves,” Smart said.\n\nOne jittery Democrat pointed me to an article on Michigan, another battleground state, in last week’s Time magazine, where Charlotte Alter wrote: “Biden’s campaign is all but invisible to the naked eye. His lack of a physical footprint is all the more striking because Trump flags festoon everything from pickup trucks to massive airplane parts being transported down the highway.”\n\nIn Cleveland, there have been noisy boat rallies for Trump on Lake Erie and there will be a horn-tooting, flag-waving vehicle parade this weekend. It is all about spreading enthusiasm and scraping up every possible vote, even though the Republicans have no chance of winning here.\n\nLisa Stickan, the chairwoman of the Republican Party in Cuyahoga county, claimed there was a “larger energy” in the Trump campaign. They are holding a lot of meetings by Zoom but they are also canvassing on the streets “in masks, and respecting social distancing for the comfort of voters”, she said.\n\nThe election forecaster Rachel Bitecofer, an expert on the Midwestern swing states, believes the Democrats have “unilaterally disarmed”.\n\nIn her view there has been a striking degree of stasis in the race — the polls haven’t budged much in months — but victory will go to the candidate who can persuade “latent partisans” to show up who might otherwise not bother to vote.\n\n“Face-to-face door-knock contact is the most effective way of getting someone to the polls,” she told me. Her verdict is blunt. The Biden campaign might succeed despite its absence on the ground, but “in my opinion, it is guilty of political malpractice”.\n\nSorry, Grandma, but there aren’t enough yellow dog Democrats to be sure of winning this.', '\nBy Rich Exner, cleveland.com\nCLEVELAND, Ohio - Ohio’s election results will not be official for some time, but there are some key things to watch as updates are released Tuesday night and likely going into Wednesday morning that will provide clues on how the final, official tally will end up.\n\n1. The early returns\nMost of the early vote, mailed in or conducted in person, will be among the first results released soon after polls close at 7:30 p.m. When you see a vote total with 0% of the precincts reporting, these are votes each Board of Elections had in hand by Election Day.\n\n\nHistorically, this is a pretty good indicator of how the final tally will turn out. A cleveland.com analysis of this early vote in local elections for Cuyahoga County last year found the typical swing from this first count until the end of the night was just 1.5 percentage points. For 109 of 115 head-to-head races or issues, the leader in absentee balloting remained ahead when the counting was done for the night.\n\nBut there are some caveats. Historically speaking, Republican candidates tend to do better with in-person voting (Donald Trump has been pushing that narrative). Polling indicates Republicans are more likely to vote Tuesday than Democrats, perhaps widening that gap. And the early-vote this year has been bigger than ever before.\n\nIf all this holds true in 2020, expect the Republicans to do better as the in-person voting results come in during the night.\n\n2. Big county votes from Cuyahoga, Franklin, Hamilton\nIncreasingly in recent elections, Republicans have built up wide support in the smaller counties; Democrats in the urban centers.\n\nIn Ohio’s three biggest counties combined - Cuyahoga (Cleveland), Franklin (Columbus) and Hamilton (Cincinnati) - the Democratic presidential candidates carried at least 60% of the vote in each of the last three elections, including Hillary Clinton’s 60.5% to 35% win over Trump in those three counties in 2016.\n\nTrump made up that 407,981-vote deficit in the three big counties by winning the combined vote in Ohio’s other 85 counties by a whopping 854,822 votes, 58.5% to 36.6%.\n\nIf there are a lot of outstanding votes in the big counties as the results arrive, Republicans should be concerned. Same goes for Democrats if the small-county voting largely is not yet tabulated.\n\nConsider this: Barack Obama ran up a 256,613-vote lead in Cuyahoga over Mitt Romney in 2012, enough to provide the difference in the election. This made up for losing the rest of the state, the combined vote for the other 87 counties, by 90,343 votes.\n\nIn 2008. Obama beat John McCain by 258,542 votes in Cuyahoga County. In the other 87 counties, Obama out-polled McCain by just 3,682 votes.\n\nHere’s what to look for Tuesday.\n\nIs Biden building upon the voting shares won by Clinton in these large counties - 66% in Cuyahoga, 60.4% in Franklin and 52.7% in Hamilton? Cuyahoga and Franklin were her best showings in all of Ohio.\n\n3. Will Trumbull County flip back?\nTrumbull County, which includes the city of Warren and is just north of Youngstown, gained a lot of attention for how it voted in 2016 - for good reason.\n\nTrump’s win in Trumbull marked the latest tumbling of what had been a blue wall of sorts in much of Eastern Ohio.\n\nStarting with Jimmy Carter’s election in 1976, six Ohio counties had reliably voted for Democratic presidential candidates each time. Those streaks ended in 2012 for three Eastern Ohio counties built on steel and coal - Jefferson, Belmont and Monroe.\n\nBut even as those Ohio River counties switched over to red, Trumbull, Mahoning and Cuyahoga stayed Democratic in 2012, each giving at least 60% of their vote to Obama.\n\nTrump then turned Trumbull four years ago, beating Clinton, 51.1% to 44.8%.\n\nIf that Trumbull margin holds Tuesday, good news for Trump. If it evaporates, Biden backers could be celebrating.\n\n\nOhio presidential election results by county, from 1972 through 2016. Darker red (Republican) and blue (Democratic) areas on the maps are counties won by at least 20 percentage points.Rich Exner, cleveland.com\n\n4. Republican strongholds\nUnlike the Electoral College, where most states are winner-take-all in presidential elections, counties can only offer trends and insights.\n\nYet, just like Democrats have done in the large counties, winning Republican candidates have been successful in building up their margins in their counties of strength.\n\nTrump received his highest shares four years ago in these five counties - Mercer (80.6%), Putnam (79.7%), Auglaize (79%), Holmes (78.9%) and Darke (78.5%).\n\nAs results come in Tuesday, it’s worth checking whether his strength has built up or shrunk.\n\n5. The vote counting does not end on election night\nWarning here, in case you haven’t heard already. The vote counting in Ohio, by law, does not end on election night, or even the day after.\n\nCounties have until Nov. 18 to complete their official tally, adding in provisional votes and absentee ballots mailed in time and arriving by Nov. 13, whether they were mailed domestically or under federal law from overseas-stationed military members and their families.\n\nDemocrats Clinton, Obama and John Kerry all did thousands of votes better than their Republican counterparts in post-election day counting, cleveland.com research found.\n\nTrump gained 69,021 Ohio votes between the unofficial count on the day after the election and the official count weeks later. Clinton added 77,163 votes, closing the margin by 8,142.\n\nObama widened his margin over Romney by 59,029 votes during this later counting in 2012, and by 56,911 over McCain in 2008. And in 2004, Kerry closed his gap on George W. Bush by 17,620 votes.\n\nKeep these numbers in mind if the unofficial tally is close.\n\n\nDemocrats have done better than Republican presidential candidates in Ohio for those votes added between the unofficial results near Election Day until the official count weeks later. (Note, in some cases the unofficial tallies differ slightly, depending on the time of publication.)Rich Exner, cleveland.com\n\n6. Ottawa County, Ohio’s bellwether\nIf all this is too complicated, boil it all down to Ottawa County, a place more well known in non-election times as a vacation retreat for summer homes and cottages on the mainland or the Lake Erie island experience of Put-in-Bay.\n\nThe fall-time residents who make Ottawa County their voting home have gone with the winning presidential candidate in 14 straight elections, starting with Lyndon Johnson in 1964.\n\nNo other Ohio county has followed this winning trend so long.\n\nYes, Ohio has also picked the winner for the same 14 elections, by far longer than any other state.\n\nBut if the results are in early from Ottawa County, this could be an early indicator.']"

The first line connecting Chicago to New York, via Buffalo, was opened on 22 February 1852, although this certainly does not mean that one could board a train in New York and sit on it until it pulled into Chicago. The journey at this time incorporated numerous changes of train, together with a gauge break and a ferry crossing of the Hudson River.\n2. The earliest direct railroad route would have run from Chicago to Detroit, Detroit to Cleveland, Cleveland to Buffalo, and then Buffalo to New York.\n3. By 1854 three railroads offered services between Chicago and points east: the Michigan Central, the MSNI, or Michigan Southern &amp; North Indiana (both of which reached the city in 1852 and provided services to Detroit and to Cleveland and Toledo), and what became known as the Chicago &amp; North Western (1854).\n4. The New York Central railroad, which incorporated in 1853 and was by 1856 the largest business corporation in the US in terms of its capitalisation and annual revenues, made deals with these companies to offer the first scheduled services running between New York and Chicago.\n5. By 1855, when the Chicago Branch of the Illinois Central Railroad was completed, 58 passenger trains were arriving and departing the city daily, and Chicago had become the focus of ten trunk lines with 2,933 miles of track leading from it to all parts of the country.\n6. William Cronon, in his *Nature\'s Metropolis: Chicago and the Great West,* says that the journey from New York to Chicago took about two weeks in c.1850, and adds that with the arrival of the railroad ""it took less than two days"".\n7. He provides a helpful map, drawn from the 1932 *Atlas of the Historical Geography of the United States*, to show the speed at which it was possible to travel westward from New York in 1830, as compared to 1857, [which you can see here.](https://www.mnn.com/green-tech/transportation/stories/how-fast-could-you-travel-across-the-us-in-the-1800s)\n\nA clearer idea of exactly what was involved here can be had from the *Annual Report of the Board of Directors of the Michigan Central Railroad* (1847), issued at a time when the route was being planned and built. This [contains a table](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VytRAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA3-PA25&amp;dq=michigan+central+completed&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiomIG8yNHfAhVmx4UKHZanDhwQ6AEIKzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=michigan%20central%20completed&amp;f=false) which estimates that the rail journey from Detroit to New York (672 miles) would take 24 hours, and that between Chicago and New York (951 miles) would take 35 hours. This estimate, it should be made clear, is based on average speeds (""express trains are figured at 33 miles per hour, on double tracks, and 28 miles on single tracks, including wood and water stops"") and not on an actual journey from point-to-point, including waits for connections. If changes are added to the figures, a total journey time of a little less than 48 hours seems reasonable, and hence Cronon\'s ""less than two-day estimate"" looks accurate.\n\nThe same sort of speeds were emphatically *not* available for freight traffic at this early date, which is not surprising when it is borne in mind that each switch of trains and gauge would have involved some complex shunting and/or transhipment of tons of goods. By the late 1850s, a ""fast"" Chicago to New York freight service was offering journey times of eight days at a cost of $1.75 per hundred pounds of goods.\n\nPassenger travel time had reduced to 24 hours by 1881 and 20 hours by 1893.\n\nWe can conclude from the difficulty of arriving at a precise figure for travel time in the early 1850s that rail-only journeys all the way from Chicago to New York probably were not made very often in the early years. There is a good reason why the railroad route was not favoured by travellers at this early date: steamboat transport via sidewheel/paddlewheel boats on the Great Lakes between either Detroit and Cleveland or Monroe and Buffalo was more comfortable and more popular for quite a few years. Poupard\'s book transcribes an 1853 advertisement in the *Monroe Commercial* newspaper that points out it was also faster to break the rail journey by taking a steamship across Lake Erie from Monroe to Buffalo than to complete the equivalent journey by rail.\n\n**Sources**\n\n[""Early Chicago, 1833-1871.

If there is absolutely no strategic use for a rail line (such as the Montour Railroad), I support turning it into a trail (and have been vocal in my support for the Montour Trail's Bethel Branch being extended over the remainder of the RR right of way through Bethel Park), but prematurely ripping out valuable rail lines and infrastructure in a way that will make them impossible to restore later on is something I am adamantly against, such as the removal of the B&amp;O's passenger line into Pittsburgh (abandoned after the PATrain was discontinued), the Panhandle Route out to the midwest (abandoned by Conrail and turned into a trail), and the pending abandonment of the AVR Brilliant Branch. The Panhandle Route was the fastest and most direct rail line from Pittsburgh to the midwest, the B&amp;O route was valuable for commuter services and removing it only makes it harder to restore rail service to the Mon Valley, and the Brilliant Branch makes it much harder to route potential passenger trains north out of Pittsburgh (as the branch connects NS's mainline through Pittsburgh to the AVR and the Conemaugh Line).\n\nI also worry about this happening to the Bessemer &amp; Lake Erie Railroad north of the city, its only money maker is transporting iron ore to US Steel and with the end of steel production in the region being a possibility in the future, the B&amp;LE would no longer serve a purpose for hauling that kind of freight and would likely be ripped up for another trail. It's the only direct north/south rail line between Pittsburgh and Erie and more thought should be put into giving it and other railroads another purpose for freight and passenger trains before they are permanently removed for bikes. Even if a right of way is railbanked for restoration of rail service in the future, it is much harder to restore a rail line that's been removed than to retain a line that is already there. We need to be thinking big picture and long-term instead of doing what is most convenient in the immediate future for a handful of people. If we want to be serious about reducing our carbon footprint and car dependency, we need more passenger rail and more incentives to ship freight by rail."", 'With Port Authority, PennDOT, and the Southwestern PA Commission all doing public feedback/comments on the future of transportation in the region and making plans for potential expansions (that will likely not happen because God Forbid we fund transit but I digress), I decided to bring back the hypothetical map I was working on a few months ago to make some changes, improvements, and expansions further out of the city. Of course, unless a MASSIVE change in the state\'s transportation funding happens and/or Americans change their attitude towards public transit, I\'m doubtful any of this would actually be implemented or constructed, but a man can dream! Here\'s an overview explaining the expansions over the existing network, changes I\'ve made, and other notes.\n\nFor those of you who didn\'t see my previous hypothetical maps, I have basically taken the existing rapid transit system (the T light rail lines and the 3 busways) and have extended them along existing corridors to cover a wider area. I have also added several regional trains that would make use of mostly existing railroad infrastructure. The majority of the expansions shown are based off existing studies that have been performed by Port Authority, PennDOT, or other entities, just to keep things as realistic and practical as possible. The major expansions over the existing rapid transit network are as follows:\n\n# Light Rail\n\nAll 3 existing light rail lines are extended north and west of the city. The Blue Line continues past the existing Allegheny station and follows the existing Norfolk Southern right-of-way up the Ohio  River Valley, serving numerous areas along that corridor before crossing the river near Sewickley, and following University Boulevard through Moon before terminating at Pittsburgh International Airport. Port Authority has studied an alignment similar to this as well as an alignment following I-376, however I personally think the river alignment would serve more people and be far more useful for transporting everyone around the region, as opposed to the Parkway alignment which is basically useless to anybody not going to the airport. The only change I\'ve made to this since my previous map was adding a stop near Coraopolis, for a potential transfer to the Beaver regional train.\n\nThe Red and Silver Lines branch off after North Side, following the existing I-279 HOV lanes to serve various neighborhoods and suburbs in the North Hills. The Red Line splits off at McKnight Road and follows it up through Ross and Wexford, while the Silver Line stays on the HOV alignment past West View and Franklin Park, before the two meet back up again in Warrendale. Presumably a new rail center for additional vehicles would be stored here or near the airport. Taking some feedback from my previous map, I adjusted a few stops along these lines and extended the Red Line to Warrendale, it had previously ended near McCandless on my last map.\n\nAdditional light rail changes include restoration of Drake, Allentown, and Penn Station service (this is virtually unchanged from my previous revisions), and acknowledging Port Authority\'s recent restoration of full-time Red Line service to South Hills Village.\n\n# Bus Rapid Transit\n\nThe Bus Rapid Transit lines are for the most part the same as my previous map - the busways are color coded now (West Busway is the Green Line, East Busway is the Purple Line, and the South Busway is the Yellow Line). I have adapted the planned Oakland BRT into my map, as it seems Port Authority is pretty hell-bent on constructing that. Currently express North Hills buses get the ""orange"" designation on system maps, however with the Silver and Red Lines taking its place in my system I\'ve moved the ""orange"" name to the Oakland BRT. The East Busway is extended to Monroeville as has been discussed, following Norfolk Southern and Union Railroad right-of-way.\n\nThe West Busway is extended past its current end in Carnegie (however I have made it a small branch off the mainline for alignment reasons), and it follows existing Pittsburgh and Ohio Central Railroad right-of-way through Heidelberg, Kirwan Heights, and Bridgeville, before using abandoned railroad right-of-way under PA 50 and I-79 to reach a terminus and transit-oriented development in South Fayette. Would be a good use of the space as those empty lots off of I-79 are slated to be developed. No changes are made to the South Busway other than the name change. I\'ve somewhat revised the Oakland BRT from Port Authority\'s official plans by removing some stops so it can be, you know, RAPID transit and not a glorified bus route. As before, it splits to head to Highland Park and Greenfield (as Port Authority has planned), and I extended the south branch beyond there to serve Homestead, Kennywood, and Duquesne.\n\n# Regional Rail\n\nThe largest change is the addition of more regional rail routes, extending to areas further out of Pittsburgh (and outside of Allegheny County). One route I already have planned is a restoration of the PATrain (Mon Valley commuter) service from Versailles to downtown that was discontinued in 1989. It uses CSX tracks to Oakland and finishes the run to Penn Station on Norfolk Southern track. Additionally, I proposed a branch of the Mon Valley line to Elizabeth, which Port Authority had proposed back in the 1980\'s before the decision was made to cut the PATrain. In this revised map I have extended both lines further, into Westmoreland County. The Elizabeth branch now runs to Monessen (this is based off a preliminary study PennDOT has done for a mid-Mon Valley commuter rail service terminating there, according to the 2020 Pennsylvania State Rail Plan, Appendix C), and the Versailles branch has been extended to West Newton.\n\nAs was on my previous map, and based off numerous studies by PennDOT, I have introduced rail service east to Latrobe (via the Norfolk Southern Pittsburgh Line), and northeast to Arnold (via the Allegheny Valley Railroad). These two routes are the most likely to see service, as more effort has been put into the feasibility studies for these two routes than any other proposed regional rail service. Service on the Allegheny Valley railroad is feasible since freight trains on the line generally only run at night, making for less logistical issues with passenger trains running on the line during the day. Substantial work would need to be done and a connection would need to be made to Penn Station, but I think this project is very much doable. As for the Latrobe service, while a lot of work has been put into studying the potential for commuter service and I think there is reasonable public interest in a commuter line, ANY passenger rail improvements on the Pittsburgh Line are always at the mercy of Norfolk Southern, as the line is a heavily busy freight route. Some traffic could be alleviated by rerouting freight trains to NS\'s Monongahela Line or the Conemaugh Line, but Norfolk Southern has repeatedly shown little interest in increased passenger service on its tracks. Maybe it\'s time to eminent domain the Pittsburgh Line...\n\nThe other proposed regional rail line that was on my previous map runs on CSX tracks along the Ohio River from Station Square to Beaver Falls, restoring the commuter train that was operated by the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad until 1985. The only change I\'ve made to it is the addition of a stop northwest of Coraopolis to provide transfers with the Blue Line.\n\nI\'ve added three new regional rail routes to this map, which are all unlikely to ever be introduced for a number of reasons. That being said, they would help bridge some transportation gaps in the region particularly north of the city, so I figured it was worthwhile to include them.\n\n2 routes run from Penn Station to the northern side of the Allegheny River (new track would need to be constructed to connect to the other side of the river), where they run along Norfolk Southern tracks before splitting at Etna. The eastern branch follows the Norfolk Southern tracks along the Allegheny River valley to Freeport. Taking suggestion from someone who commented on my previous map, the western branch follows the Buffalo and Pittsburgh Railroad line along PA 8 to Butler County, terminating in Zelienople. I believe a Pennsylvania Railroad commuter train followed this route until they pulled all of their commuter routes in the 1960\'s. I can\'t find any solid plans for a route in this corridor, but the 2040 Transportation and Development Plan for Southwestern Pennsylvania mentions discussion of a commuter rail line to Butler County that I imagine would use this route. Nowhere could I find a study for a line to Freeport, but who knows!\n\nThe other new regional rail route I introduced uses the Pittsburgh and Ohio Central Railroad right-of-way to provide passenger rail service from Washington and other communities along the I-79/Chartiers Valley corridor to Station Square. This is another route that formerly saw commuter services operated by the Pennsylvania Railroad, and while there are no plans or studies that I know of that would use this route for passenger service, there have been a few excursion trains that have run on the line over the years, so it is certainly possible if enough demand and resources were there.']"

It took place on October 5, 1813 in Upper Canada, near Chatham. The British lost control of Southwestern Ontario as a result of the battle; Tecumseh and war chief Roundhead were killed, and Tecumseh\'s Confederacy largely fell apart.\n\nBritish troops under Major General Henry Procter had occupied Detroit until the United States Navy gained control of Lake Erie, depriving them of their supplies. Procter was forced to retreat north up the Thames River to Moraviantown, followed by the tribal confederacy under Shawnee leader Tecumseh and war chief Roundhead who were his allies. American infantry and cavalry under Major, and future president, General William Henry Harrison drove off the British and then defeated the Indians, who were demoralized by the deaths of Tecumseh and Roundhead in action. American control was re-established in the Detroit area, the tribal confederacy collapsed, and Procter was court-martialled for his poor leadership.\n\nWilliam Henry Harrison\'s force numbered at least 3,500 infantry and cavalry. He had a small detachment of regulars from the 27th U.S. Infantry and five brigades of Kentucky militia led by Isaac Shelby, the 63 year-old governor of Kentucky and a hero of the American Revolutionary War. He also had 1,000 volunteer cavalry under Colonel Richard Mentor Johnson. Most of Johnson\'s men were from Kentucky, but some were from the River Raisin area of Michigan, all of them spurred on by the slogan ""Remember the River Raisin."" (to know why, see [Battle of Frenchtown] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Frenchtown)).\n\nProcter had about 800 soldiers, mainly from the 41st Regiment. The veterans of the regiment\'s 1st Battalion had been serving in Upper Canada since the start of the war and had suffered heavy casualties in several engagements in 1813, including the Battle of Lake Erie, where more than 150 of its men had served aboard Barclay\'s ships. They had been reinforced by the young soldiers of the 2nd Battalion. Most of the regiment\'s officers were dissatisfied with Procter\'s leadership, but Colonel Warburton, the next in seniority, refused to countenance any move to remove him from command. Tecumseh and Roundhead led about 500 Indians.\n\nMore infos about the [War of 1812] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812)\n\nMore infos about the [Battle of the Thames] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Thames)']"

The original plan for the region was to have Michigan, then below it other states south of an east-west line touching the southernmost point of Lake Michigan.\n\nOhio was made a state with that line for its northern border. The line reached Lake Erie just south of Toledo. When Michigan was about to become a state there was that [Toledo War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toledo_War) thing, where Ohio wanted, and eventually got Maumee Bay and the city of Toledo at the west end of Lake Erie.\n\nOhio\'s northern border was adjusted so its eastern end was a point just north of Maumee Bay. But rather than raise the whole border north they angled it so it would still touch the southernmost point of Lake Michigan, if it was continued west past Ohio\'s western border. Indiana Territory\'s northern border at the time was still an east-west line just touching the bottom of Lake Michigan, so Ohio stuck up a bit north of Indiana (instead of the reverse like today), and its ""virtual"" northern border extending west to southernmost Lake Michigan passed through Michigan Territory.\n\nA few years later Indiana was made a state. It was then that Congress finally realized how silly it would be to have a state sitting right next to the Great Lakes inland sea with a shoreline measured in feet, if that. So Congress moved Indiana\'s border ten miles north, resulting in the situation today:\n\nThe IN-MI border is due east-west, 10 miles north of the southernmost point of Lake Michigan. The OH-MI border is not due east-west but angled and still based on that southernmost point of Lake Michigan.\n\nBasically you can blame the rivalry between Ohio and Michigan, still strong today, for the borders of Ohio and Indiana not being all neat and square.', ""It nearly ended in conflict. And it was all over Toledo. Yes... Toledo.\n\nIt all went back to how the territorial lines were drawn originally, how the language of different  territories we're  drawn up, and how the state lines ended up being drawn. Michigan's southern border was originally supposed to be an east-west line through the southerly bend or extreme of lake Michigan (and this was determined before there was a Michigan territory)... But no one knew exactly where that was. Today we know it to be in Gary, Indiana.\n\nAnyway... Of the three territories involved with this line... Ohio was the first to apply for statehood... They knew that lake Michigan went further south than was originally believed, and they believed, based on the maps that were available to Congress at the time of dividing the Northwest territory that Congress always intended for Ohio to have a border containing all or most of the western Lake Erie...and included language in their Constitution to ensure that by including Maumee Bay as part of the state. Michigan became a territory 3 years after Ohio's statehood and their line differed from Ohio's.\n\nSo... Time goes on Indiana joins the union and a survey is finally commissioned... To a man from Ohio who makes sure that the line is drawn based on the Ohio constitution and not on the more recent line of Michigan's territorial ordinance... Michigan didn't like this survey and conducted their own. This brought us the Toledo strip. An area that... While we make fun of it today... Looked like prime real estate back then. The land was excellent for farming and it was well placed for canals and as an inland port. \n\nMichigan essentially occupies the Strip... Towns are established thinking they are in Michigan... Michigan gets the population to apply for statehood and is rejected because of the still disputed Toledo strip. Ohio asserts their claims as does Michigan. The militias are called out... And Andrew Jackson has a problem he really didn't want. Ohio was big back then... We are talking like modern Florida important in elections... Michigan was a territory... And Jackson's Attorney General to told him legally the land was Michigan's... Until Congress said otherwise... Jackson not wanting to piss off a major part of the electorate nor completely break the law instead chose to send out arbitrators. A deal was stuck... Then promptly ignored...\n\nEventually... The militias shot at each other... Tensions continued to mount as Michigan continued to pay legislation to become a state. Eventually a Michigan sheriff was stabbed by an Ohio man. Leading to further tension. \n\nEventually... Ohio's Congressmen got involved. They got Congress to request that the Michigan governor be removed... And he was... Then Congress passed a bill allowing Michigan to become a state... If they ceded the strip... In exchange... They would be granted the upper peninsula.\n\nThis seemed like a shit deal at the time... The copper in the pennisula was unknown at the time and it was completely wild. But time wore on... Militias cost money and... The treasury was about to give away money to the states... But not too territories... After much angst...accepted the deal to become a state.\n\nYou'll note that Michigan does not control the southern part of Lake Michigan either... But that's another less interesting story for another time"", 'Let me tell you a little story about thievery, betrayal, bloodshed, and government sellouts:\n\nIt’s the early 1800’s, and the American population is growing into its western claims, so much so that the US Government decides to carve some new states out of the Northwest Territory.\n\nBecause everyone deserves some grace on their first try, we’ll forgive the early fathers of our country for first forming Ohio in 1803.  In Ohio’s statehood charter, it was stated that Ohio’s northern border would be the line running from the southernmost tip of Lake Michigan to where that line meets a natural stopping point (everyone assumed from the best maps at the time that would be Lake Erie, but that it might be as far north as Detroit).  Everyone was content with this determination, and in 1803 Ohio became the nation’s 17th State.\n\nNext would be Indiana.  Their Territorial Charter also stated their northern border would extend east from the southernmost point of Lake Michigan.  Unfortunately for the poor Hoosiers, this would leave them with a pittance of Great Lakes access, so they negotiated a purchase from the Michigan Territory of the land in a 10 mile strip north of the pre-existing border.  The purchase was agreed upon, and in 1816 Indiana became the 19th state, with triple the lake frontage they would have had without this purchase, and a border with the Michigan Territory that was 10 miles further north than the Ohio border.\n\nThe final character in our story is Michigan.  Around 1820 the Michigan Territory has tried to set its borders, and is discovering the actual limit of Lake Michigan is far enough south that the city of Toledo on the Maumee River and Lake Erie will belong to Michigan!  What great news for the Territory as it is about to become a state!  Michigan requests statehood in 1833 with these borders, and Ohio throws a hissyfit!  They were under the impression that Ohio would have claim to Toledo, so they veto Michigan’s statehood until Toledo is surrendered to Ohio.  This led former President and active Congressman John Quincy Adams to say “Never in the course of my life have I known a controversy of which all the right was so clearly on one side and all the power so overwhelmingly on the other.""\n\nIn March of 1835 Ohio sent 600 troops in an attempt to steal this strip of land for themselves, but Michigan (and its 24 year old “Boy Governor” Stevens T. Mason) was having none of that, and sent a militia of 1000 men to prevent Ohio from setting any illegal border markers in land that was rightfully Michigan’s.  The sides met in Perrysburg in stalemate for a few months as President Andrew Jackson sent federal representatives to broker peace between the two sides.\n\nBoth sides, meanwhile, were drafting laws to arrest members of the other who were claiming the Toledo Strip.  In July, a Michigan Deputy Sherriff was making an arrest on such a law, when the son of the belligerent stabbed the Michigan officer and fled back into Ohio.  Fortunately for the Ohioans, the Michiganders’ cooler heads prevailed, and this was the only serious bloodshed of the conflict.\n\nFinally, however, President Jackson had enough, and while Michigan was in the right, Ohio was a swing state with large representation that he did not want to risk losing in the upcoming presidential election.  He removed Michigan’s governor and replaced him with a man recommended by Ohio’s congressmen.  This puppet governor accepted Ohio’s terms, and so Ohio was able to survey their own borderline from a point north of Toledo going in a straight line toward the southernmost tip of Lake Michigan.  As a concession, Michigan was given the western ¾ of the Upper Peninsula, which had otherwise been granted to the Wisconsin Territory.\n\nAnd that is the story of why Indiana’s border with Michigan is farther north and Ohio’s border with Michigan isn’t directly East-West.']"

It has two fewer midbody scales (15) than *Storeria dekayi* and is more likely to have yellow collar markings on the neck.\n\n*Storeria* brown and redbelly snakes are not considered medically significant to humans in terms of venom and are usually reluctant to bite, but all animals with a mouth can use it in self-defense.\n\n[Relevant/Recent Phylogeography](http://www.cnah.org/pdf/88517.pdf)\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nEastern Foxsnakes *Pantherophis vulpinus* are large (91-137cm, record 179cm), harmless ratsnakes native to the US Midwestern states east of the Mississippi River, and southern Ontario in Canada. Their diet is primarily rodents, but they will also eat frogs, birds, and their eggs. Lake Erie/Lake Michigan populations are particularly fond of rodents, with some individuals subsisting almost entirely on voles (*Microtus*).\n\n*P. vulpinus* are habitat generalists and use prairie, meadows, marshes, fens, agricultural land, sand dunes, oak savanna, and woodland. Lake Erie/Lake Michigan populations utilize similar habitat, but are more strongly tied to marshes and other moist, grassy areas.  They sometimes turn up in residential and even urban areas in some parts of their range, especially in the suburbs of Chicago.\n\nA closely related and morphological similar species, the Western Foxsnake *Pantherophis ramspotti*, ranges west of the Mississippi River, and the two are known hybridize in a narrow zone along it.\n\n[Range Map (Species Complex) - *P. vulpinus* dark](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Map-depicting-the-approximate-distributions-of-the-two-foxsnake-mtDNA-lineages-as_fig1_258402898)  |  [Range Map (Individual) - © Rune Midtgaard](https://repfocus.dk/maps1/TAX/Serpentes/Colubridae/Pantherophis_vulpinus_map.html) \n\n[Relevant/Recent Phylogeography](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258402898_A_Reevaluation_of_the_Status_of_the_Foxsnakes_Pantherophis_gloydi_Conant_and_P_vulpinus_Baird_and_Girard_Lepidosauria)\n\n*This short account was prepared by /u/fairlyorange and edited by /u/Phylogenizer*.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n*I am a bot created for /r/whatsthissnake, /r/snakes and /r/herpetology to help with snake identification and natural history education.

I don't feel like I'm missing out going to the beach on Lake Erie. I've been to the ocean. It just feels like the great lakes but with salt. Which is great, but I have no reason to move because of the ocean.  It isn't so much better that  it's a positive point for me. The large body of water is the positive point for me, not because its the ocean."", 'I didn’t see the ocean until a few friends and I went on a spontaneous weekend trip to Maine. Honestly, it was kind of underwhelming, but maybe it was just the time of year I went (winter).\n\nMy parents live on Lake Erie, so during high school and when I visit I get to see the waters stretch to the horizon. My family also takes vacations to Michigan and  when I go I see the lakes there pretty often. I’m not sure why, but I always though the ocean would be different from the Great Lakes in some way, even if it was just a feeling.\n\nWhen I saw the ocean, my first though was “well, this is just a larger lake.”\n\nNow, I will say the thing I was probably most curious about was how salty ocean water is. Everybody says it’s salty, but since I never saw, let alone swam, in the ocean before, I had no idea exactly what it tasted like. So, I wanted to know exactly how salty it was. When we saw the ocean, I stood there for a moment and just took in the view of this larger lake. Then I dipped my hand in and scooped a bit of water out and tasted it. \n\nFor anybody who is just as curious as I was, I can confirm it is pretty salty.', 'New York City. \n\nI travelled to NYC from Chicago to visit my girlfriend for the first time. We ended up not meeting because of her parents, but I decided it was not at all an issue. It wasn\'t meant to be at the time. Anyway, the drive wasn\'t terrible. Great scenery. Many mountains and beautiful parks on our way. First stop, Lake Erie. \n\nI cried. \n\nThe lake was so skimp I could see piles of sand poking over the water. The waves? Small, thick. You could hear the density of the water as it slushed against the sand. The sand was stained a dirty colour from the water, which, from where we watched, was black. We decided we couldn\'t touch that... water? Whatever, we supposed it was just that beach. We packed up and drove to another beach. Surely, this one would please us. As soon as we stopped, I had a gut-wrenched feeling saying, ""hey, this water is probably musty too."" I ignored it. I was just spoiled because of the clean water at Lake Michigan, I concluded. \n\nI was wrong. So wrong. \n\nWe get off and go to see the lake, hopeful we could venture inside of it. No, no we did not. There was **foam** at the surface. Foam, algae, black substance (???), and so much slime I could not fathom setting a toe inside of that... mystery liquid. Instead, my siblings and I travelled to a small puddle of water, filtered by rocks. We stared at it for a good twenty minutes as our parents got ready to leave. While we stood there, we turned our heads in HORROR at the locals coming to rest on the beach. Country music filled the fish-tainted air as they set up for their stay. A grown woman, newborn, dog, and two teenage boys got INTO THE WATER. \n\nI felt a **guttural** response to the lunatics getting inside of the tar lake. My eyes widened and my mouth went dry. I could not believe what I had just witnessed. They were now neck deep in that... muck. \n\nWe packed up and left shortly afterwards. We had seen enough.\n\nOf to the city we went. \n\nWhen we got to New York, there were five main takeaways from this experience. \n\nOne, People are very rude.   \nTwo, Bathrooms close at four pm.   \nThree, No recycling bins and very few garbage bins. IN A PARK.  \nFour, Graffiti is predominant in these areas.  \nAnd, five... No other bathrooms. Anywhere. \n\nNaturally, as tourists, we tried giving NYC a chance. Of course, we\'d be open-minded. I was horrified, Reddit users. Horrified. We get to Time Square, and as people who are used to famous cities, we expected nothing less. Pretty lights everywhere, famous shops, and ---- TRASH???\n\nMOUNTAINS of trash. I do not exaggerate when I narrate, that there were mountains continuously and as tall as bus stop signs. Our jaws dropped when we saw them. I had heard of rat issues in the past, but I had never really known why. I now know why. Coming from a city with clean streets and equally beautiful (and original, I may add...) buildings, I was in utter disbelief. \n\nAs we continued, we only got to realize more. Step one foot out of the famous part of NYC, and it\'s almost as bad as Chicago crime. In comparison to Chicago, too, in the most non-biased way possible, Chinatown wasn\'t even half of Chicago\'s. It was also right beside Little Italy, which was just as graffitied as Chinatown. \n\nIn summary... Reconsider that trip if you don\'t want to be mildly disappointed, at the least.']"

I'll update this post momentarily with some nice stuff. Everything I list will be native and/or pollinator friendly unless I specify otherwise.\n\n**Perennials:**\n\nPenstemon (Beardtongue): Flowers early summer, including white, pink, purple, red, and even true blue. Foliage can be green, dark red, or purple. My personal favourite is '[Dark Towers](http://www.terranovanurseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Penstemon-Dark-Towers-1-510x510.jpg)', with dark reddish-purple foliage and pink flowers. Part to full shade; loves heat and clay. I use these in lieu of Iris.\n\nEchinacea (Coneflower): Flowers mid-summer in every colour except blue. Will re-bloom if dead-headed, and most self-seed if left over winter. However, many can be treated as annuals as they're hybridized from Mexican varieties. 'Ruby Star', along with the 'Magnus', 'Pow-wow' and 'Sombrero' series' are reliable. Sun and part shade; tolerates clay.\n\nPhlox subulata (Creeping Phlox): Semi-evergreen groundcover flowering for over a month starting mid-spring. Comes in white, pink, red, striped, and various shades of purple. I prefer '[Emerald Blue](http://www.danzfamily.com/archives/blogphotos/14/125-emerald-blue-creeping-phlox.jpg)'. Next to invincible and not invasive. Sun or part shade, doesn't care about soil type.\n\nSedum (Stonecrop): Very tough plant that grows anywhere except heavy shade. Great for winter interest and holds up in snow. Tends to flop if overwatered. Comes in green or purple foliage with pink flowers. Not native, but bees absolutely _love_ the flowers to the point where you can't even get near them there's so many.\n\nGeranium (Cranesbill): Low-growing but vigorous plant that flowers all summer. May get ratty part-way through the season, in which case it can be cut back to the ground and it just starts over again. Full sun or part-shade. Non-native but bees like it. Best cultivar available right now is '[Rozanne](http://northcoastgardening.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/geraniumrozannewithacorus.jpg)'.\n\n**Shrubs:**\n\nCornus sericea (Red-twig dogwood): Very common and almost overused. New cultivars 'Midwinter Fire' and 'Prairie Fire' are compact and have vibrant red stems.\n\nAmalanchier (Serviceberry): Very tough flowering shrub, commonly used in shopping plazas. White flowers in early summer and  edible berries mid-summer that the birds will fight you for. Excellent fall foliage. Comes in multi-stem or small tree form. Prefers full sun but tolerates part shade.\n\nIlex verticillata (Winterberry): Deciduous holly that gets covered in red berries come fall. Birds love this. Does not care about soil type and will tolerate moisture. You will need 1 male plant for every 3-5 female plants. 'Red Sprite' is a solid dwarf cultivar.\n\nPhysocarpus (Ninebark): Tough as nails shrub that grows in bedrock on lakeshores. Used mainly for foliage, which comes in purple, yellow, orange, and more. Flowers for a few weeks mid-summer. Prefers full sun or part shade. Can be hacked back down to the ground and comes right back up.\n\n**Grasses:**\n\nPanicum (Switchgrass): One of the dominant prairie grasses, you can still see this growing along lakeshores. I've seen lots along Lake Erie. Does not die out in the middle like Miscanthus and doesn't grow as wide. Foliage colour varies from blue, green, brown, and red. Flowers of various colours in late summer. Holds up with snow, laughs in the face of clay, but prefers more sunlight or it may flop.\n\nSchizachyrium (Little bluestem): Another prairie grass. About 2/3 the size of Panicum. Foliage is green, blue, or dark purple. Fall foliage looks like a fiery rainbow. Full sun or part shade. Best used in massed plantings."", 'You\'ve certainly put a lot of effort and forethought into this. A few notes for future maintenance needs:\n\n* Most shrubs and trees can handle 30% cutback per season, provided they receive regular water. \n\n* The best way to trim barberry is with a flamethrower. Failing that, multiple layers of thick gloves usually keep the worst spines out of your hands.\n\n* Buying plants from a wholesaler (plant nursery) will save you a shitload of money, even from Home Depot. Sometimes they\'ll let you pay with cash, but often only deal with landscapers. Downside is no warranty this way.\n\n* Mulch is your friend. With 2-3"" thickness, it acts as a weed barrier (prevent germination), insulates the roots from extreme heat and cold, retains more moisture &amp; reduces evaporation, looks better than bare soil, and can smell good too - pine is my personal favourite. It will seriously save you a lot of time in terms of weeding and watering.\n\n\nAs for plants, luckily, you\'re just a couple hours east of me so plant suggestions are easy. \n\nYou can replace the barberry hedge with ninebark (Physocarpus opulifolius). It\'s native, there are many different colours of foliage, they have decent flowers, and you don\'t have to trim every 2-4 weeks like with barberry. It generally finishes growing by July/August and can then be cut back once. These are tough as nails - they grow in bedrock along the shores of Lake Erie!\n\nI\'d recommend dwarf cedars (Thuja occidentalis) over boxwood. Boxwoods have plenty of pests, and are harder to keep looking good. Cedars are tougher, more drought tolerant, have less pests, and are native and so help the local ecosystem. If you let them grow loose, they have a sturdy yet loose appearance. You also get the nice scent.\n\nAs for general shrubs, here are a few attractive, yet tough, selections that I like to use.\n\n* Serviceberry (Amelanchier canadensis) is great for early summer flower and fall colour, plus has delicious edible berries - basically a blueberry tree.\n\n* Red-twig dogwood (Cornus sericea) is very hardy and can be cut to the ground every couple years. Several foliage colours available, and I found out the \'Prairie Fire\' cultivar has the most vivid red stems I\'ve ever seen.\n\n* St. John\'s Wort is another very tough shrub that has both pretty yellow flowers and interesting seed heads afterwards.\n\nThere are several perennials that would fit your bill. Most of these require next to no maintenance and are all drought-tolerant.\n\n* Beardtongue (Penstemon digitalis) has cultivars with dark red foliage and large spikes of flowers in early summer. Great for massed plantings. Dead-head once flowering is done for a better show the next year or leave up for glossy seedheads.\n\n* Creeping phlox (Phlox subulata) is a creeping semi-evergreen groundcover that flowers for over a month right about now. Great for keeping weeds down and reducing mulch needs.\n\n* Stonecrop (sedum) is almost invincible. Flowers in late summer, holds up well all winter. Green, bluish, and purple foliage colours are available.\n\n* Blue False Indigo (Baptisia australis) is a tough one that grows pretty big. 3-5 feet tall big. Large spikes of flowers that can be most colours, with attractive seed pods that rattle around when dried and hold up most of the winter.\n\n* Black-eyed Susan (Rudbeckia fulgida) is a common staple. Spreads fairly quickly and can be more or less ignored while it does its thing. Seeds itself _very_ aggressively, so put it somewhere you want it to fill in.\n\n* Coneflower (Echinacea purpurea) is another commonly used native perennial with many different colours. Very drought-tolerant. Pollinators love the flowers and birds love the seeds. Can be deadheaded to increase reblooming but not necessary. \'Ruby Star\' has the largest flowers &amp; growth habit, while \'Pow-wow Wildberry\' is smaller, but gets dozens of blooms on a single plant in a rough globe shape. These will also seed themselves readily.\n\nThere are also some ornamental grasses, which you can more or less establish then ignore until spring.\n\n* Little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium) is a native prairie grass. Bluish or dark purple summer foliage, then goes multi-coloured in fall. Great for mass plantings. \n\n* Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) is another dominant native prairie grass. Holds up very well in winter, and very difficult to kill. Many foliage colours available, and gets coloured flowers in mid summer. Unlike the more commonly used maidengrass (Miscanthus), switchgrass doesn\'t die out in the middle after a few years.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions. Hope this helps!', ""I've been working on using mainly native species in my plantings if I can. It's better for the local ecosystem and it's a marketing point. There are some exceptions, of course, but it's fairly easy to do. I do count cultivars as native if they are derived from the pure native species (e.g. Echinacea purpurea 'Ruby Star'). I also like to use different colours of foliage to add contrast. \n\nI don't use too many plants for spring since bulbs and Phlox do the job nicely. Summer is when you get the most bang for your buck. Lots here!\n\n__Bulbs: __\n\nMainly Narcissus, Hyacinthus, and Allium giganteum. Tulips are nice, but the squirrels like them too much.\n\n__Perennials: __\n\nPhlox subulata is an excellent fast-growing semi-evergreen groundcover. It flowers for over a month in early spring, is extremely drought-tolerant and will take part shade, with less vigour. \n\nPenstemon digitalis (Beardtongue) is my current favourite native perennial. 'Dark Towers' has strong stems with lots of pink tubular flowers that bees love _and_ dark red foliage. Very drought tolerant and great for clay. Flowers early summer.\n\nIris is a typical go-to perennial for most people. Lots of colour, drought tolerant. Flowers early summer. \n\nEchinacea purpurea (Coneflower) is one of my favourite mid-late summer flowering perennials. Native and drought-tolerant with very deep roots. Reblooms if dead-headed regularly. There are many different colours, but beware that many of these are hybridized with Mexican varieties and Their Bloodline Is Weak And They Will Not Survive The Winter. Some are essentially annuals; look for the full species name. \n\nRudbeckia fulgida (Black-eyed Susan) is very common and very hard to kill. Also spreads like crazy through expansion and seed. 'Goldsturm' is 99% of what you'll see and use. Drought-tolerant but wilts easily, making it look like it's having trouble. Yellow flowers mid summer to early fall. Decent winter interest if light snow and not exposed to wind.\n\nGeranium 'Rozanne' is an excellent edging perennial. Generously reblooming purple flowers from early summer until frost. If it gets gangly just cut it back to the base and it will regrow with renewed vigour.\n\nLeucanthemum (Shasta Daisy) is another good edging perennial. White flowers mid summer and good green foliage. Tends to spread.\n\nHeuchera (Coral Bells) are good for edging and mass plantings for any sun and any soil. Every colour foliage in many patterns and shape except blue. Flowers in a bit of a lull between spring and early summer, then periodically through the summer if dead-headed. Mainly used for foliage colour.\n\nHemerocallis (Daylily) is a very common perennial that is used by landscapers and towns everywhere because you quite literally can not kill these things. I've tried. Flowering time varies from early to late summer depending on cultivar. Will often rebloom if you cut the entire thing down to the base. I tend to try and avoid these just because of how common they are.\n\nHostas are your typical shade perennial in hundreds of patterns and shapes of green, white, blue, and lime. Flowering time varies between cultivars. These are also pretty much invincible to anything you throw at them. I also try to avoid these due to how common they are but sometimes are necessary.\n\nSedum (Stonecrop) is yet another invincible perennial for edging and mass planting. Exists as both groundcover and flowering perennial, of which I use the latter. Foliage in both green and purple, flowers usually pink in late summer to early fall. Excellent for winter interest as they tend to mostly hold until spring.\n\nAster flowers late summer to mid fall depending on cultivar. These spread through underground rhizomes. Aggressively. \n\nAsclepias tuberosa (Butterflyweed) is a native milkweed that Monarch butterflies lay eggs on &amp; consume. I've seen them on these before. Very drought tolerant, likes clay, and orange flowers mid-summer. Tends to come up later than most perennials. May rebloom if you dead-head.\n\nEupatorium rugosum (Chocolate boneset) is a less known perennial. White flowers in early fall and has chocolate brown to dark purple foliage most of the season. \n\nBaptisia australis (Blue False Indigo) is, despite the name, a native drought tolerant perennial. Many different colour of flower in mid summer. Seed pods rattle in the wind if you let them mature. These get big.\n\nHepatica (Liverleaf) is a native ephemeral that grows in forests. The very first thing to flower in the spring and somewhat rare. Needs part to full shade. If you can find some for purchase (DO NOT DIG THESE UP!!!!) they will greatly add to a shady garden. Blue, white, or pink flowers depending on species.\n\n__Shrubs:__ Most flowering deciduous shrubs can be cut back to the ground for rejuvenation.\n\nPrunus pumila (Purple Sandcherry) provides excellent red/purple foliage and gorgeous white flowers in early summer. I've been using these less as they are susceptible to many fruit tree problems.\n\nSambucus nigra (Black Lace Elderberry) has graceful dark purple foliage all season long and slightly scented whitish pink flowers in early-mid summer. These can get big if you let them. Another favourite. \n\nPhysocarpus (Ninebark) is an extremely drought tolerant native shrub. Seriously, these things thrive in bedrock along the shore of Lake Erie. Several different colours of foliage, flowers briefly in early-mid summer. Good in mass plantings for foliage colour.\n\nIlex meserveae (Winterberry) is a native deciduous holly that grows around bogs and in the woods. Drought tolerant, likes clay and wet soil. Gets covered in berries for the winter once established. Just started using this so no real impressions yet.\n\nThuja occidentalis (White Cedar) is your typical cedar. Many different sizes and shapes, can be cut back to stubs and regrow. Useful when needing an evergreen foundation since it smells better than Taxus.\n\nArctostaphylos uva-ursi (Bearberry) is a native evergreen groundcover shrub. Tiny pink flowers in spring and red berries in fall into the winter. From what I've seen despises clay. Very drought and salt-tolerant.\n\nCornus (Dogwood) is a useful shrub for winter interest. Mostly the ones with red stems in the winter. There are a few native species which I currently forget, but several colours of foliage as well. Flowers early summer but more or less irrelevant. \n\nAmelanchier canadensis is another tough as nails native shrub/small tree. White flowers in early summer and excellent fall colour. You often see these in parking lots due to their resistance to, well, everything.\n\nRhododendron is a very graceful flowering evergreen shrub for upscale homes. Somewhat needy, requiring acidic soil, regular moisture, and part shade unless heavily irrigated. Flowering times vary from mid spring to mid summer depending on cultivar. Dead-head once flowering is finished for better blooms the following year.\n\nAcer palmatum (Japanese Maple) are good shrubs for focal points and contrast. Many colours, sizes, and lead shapes. Drought tolerant once established and don't care about soil type. Need a sheltered location or they _will_ get leaf scorch and winter dieback.\n\nTsuga canadensis (Canadian Hemlock) is typically a tree, but I've found some excellent dwarf and weeping cultivars. These are fairly drought tolerant once established and have graceful, airy emerald green foliage.\n\n__Grasses__: All of these are drought tolerant and tolerate any soil type. I particularly like the native grasses. These are good for winter interest, cornerstones, adding height, and contrast.\n\nPanicum virgatum (Switchgrass) is a native prairie grass. Flowers mid to late summer and offers a very airy look. Best viewed against the sun where it lights up the florets. Several foliage colours. \n\nSchizachyrium scoparium (Little Bluestem) is another native prairie grass. Shorter than the rest of the list, also comes in more colours ranging from blue to almost-black. Excellent in mass plantings.\n\nAndropogon Gerardii (Big Bluestem) is yet another native prairie grass. The tallest in this list, has a couple different foliage colours. For instance, 'Red October' turns crimson red in late fall. Still trialing this one.\n\nMiscanthus (Maiden Grass) is the most common ornamental grass by far. Tougher than nails and available in numerous sizes and colours. 'Morning Light' is variegated white and green and 'Adagio' is a very solid green cultivar. I've used both and they are reliable. Many cultivars of Miscanthus tends to die in the middle after maturing.\n\nPennisetum (Fountain Grass) is another very common grass. They are great for mass planting and hold up well in winter, but tend to spread via seed and tend to have random chunks die out.\n\n__Trees: __\n\nAcer rubrum (Red Maple) is a solid shade tree that has excellent fall colour. Also native. 'Nuff said.\n\nCercis canadensis is a tough native small tree. Covered in pink flowers in mid spring. Some cultivars such as 'Forest Pansy' have purple foliage most of the season. There are also several weeping cultivars. Keep in mind these _need_ to harden off in the fall or they _will_ have reduced winter hardiness so turn off your irrigation to these! \n\nMetasequoia glyptostroboides (Dawn Redwood) is an excellent specimen tree. Deciduous conifer. Will eventually get huge.""]"
