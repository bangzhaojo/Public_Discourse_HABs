My only comment is that I understand most of that soluble nitrogen gets washed away from usable farmland, into water bodies as a pollutant often triggering things like Lake Erie toxic algea blooms. Eventually this dies and falls to the bottom layers and is effectively no longer contributing to the cycle  or carrying capacity.\n\nPhosphorous is similar in that human waste and sanitation dumps the resource in a similar way. There was research on extracting key nutrients for reuse, but I don't think its been commercialized.\n\nThe \"easy\" solution of composting biological waste to be repurposed as fertilizer and keeping it as usable terrestrial sources has consequences of magnifying feedback loops of unwanted contaminants like pharmaceuticals, hormone disruptors, heavy metals, and now PFAS and microplastics.

The Simpsons' three eyed fish jokes and such were based on the Willamette as Matt Groening grew up in Eugene/Springfield and the Willamette there was also off limits. \n I visited Riverfront two weeks ago, it was still greenish and had beer cans floating at the dock near the old wheelboat. I wouldn't drink it, definitely wouldn't pay the possible 600-900 bucks of a triathlon fee to swim in it. \n\nSo here's some news from recently (as in 2022 recently) and know that I absolutely think the Ironman Triathlon would charge people several hundred dollars to swim in garbage water, especially because they probably only look at Portland statistics and not Salem ones.\n\nhttps://columbiainsight.org/on-union-pacific-land-garbage-flows-into-willamettee-river/\n\nhttps://www.opb.org/article/2022/06/04/willamette-river-oregon-trash-tmdl/\n\nEdit: Eh, I don't know left from right still, why should I notice north to south. \nMy knowledge and news sources still say it's a pretty badly polluted river that shouldn't cost 600 bucks to swim in",

It is basically like a solid cylinder -- All I know is, when I put water in the top container (that has micro organisms visible under microscope) and then slide samples of water after filtration, there aren't any. It's the same type of filtration system that camp filters like Katadyn and Sawyer use -- and those also prevent bacteria like giardia, e coli, cholera, cynobacteria and microcystins.\n\nI learned all of this back when the area I live in had a huge microcystin outbreak in the water supply for our area (Lake Erie/Superior). People went crazy, going out of state to buy water, fighting each other in the stores and otherwise being terrible.

        "As an ecologist, I love to see it. This is a good sign.  I\u2019m also interested because I\u2019m pretty sure there is an algae bloom on Lake Erie near Monroe right now. Fish flies aka mayflies from the order Ephemeroptera (pretty sure genus is Hexagenia for these swarms) live in the lake bottom (aka benthos) as nymphs for up to 2 years before emerging as the winged adults that you see on land. They burrow in the soft sediments and are and indicator of good water quality. They feed on detritus, or decomposing bits that fall to the lake bottom. In some parts of the Great Lakes, these mayfly swarms don\u2019t happen anymore due to pollution and human altered habitat. The emerging adults provide abundant food for fish. If they make out of the water, they\u2019ll mate, lay eggs on the water, then die. \n\nA lot of other common summer insects have similar life cycles - dragonflies and damselflies spend most of their life cycle as aquatic nymphs as well. Dragonfly nymphs are fierce predators - there\u2019s some pretty cool YouTube videos of them eating small minnows and other bugs that live on the bottom of the water column (aka benthic invertebrates).",

Our cumulative urine would fill .00525 cubic km.\n\nIf we're using the smallest sea, the Baltic sea has 20,900 cubic km of volume or 3,980,952.38 larger area.\n\nEven the smallest of the five Great Lakes, Lake Erie, is over 91,428.57 times larger with 480 cubic km.\n\nAgain, I'm not taking into account true bladder sizes (and that we don't need to pee when they are completely full but start to need to pee around a third to half fullness), and I'm also using basins and seas, as the global ocean is actually considered one large body (not going to even try to go into those numbers since they're too big to relate to).\n\nSo no, we couldn't create an ocean of pee. The Earth is a lot larger than people think.",

This results in much lower snow accumulations.\n\nWhat's extraordinarily important, and not understood by Ohioans, Americans, and certainly not by our politicians based on their public comments, warming will accelerate even more rapidly going forward barring a rapid transition away from fossil fuel consumption.  Natural feedback loops, such the thawing of the North American permafrost releasing massive amounts of greenhouse gases, have the potential to overwhelm the environment.\n\n[https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/permafrost-thaw-warming-world-arctic-institute-permafrost-series-fall-winter-2020/](https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/permafrost-thaw-warming-world-arctic-institute-permafrost-series-fall-winter-2020/)\n\nArctic Amplification more directly impacts Ohio, as every year there is simply less Arctic cold air available to reach down into Ohio.\n\n[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/the-arctic-is-warming-nearly-four-times-faster-than-the-rest-of-the-world](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/the-arctic-is-warming-nearly-four-times-faster-than-the-rest-of-the-world)\n\nThe jet stream is moving northward with disastrous consequences.  Ohio increasingly will see its climate dominated by more southern weather systems, often associated with warm, humid air originating in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n[https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/storm-steering-jet-stream-could-shift-poleward-in-40-years/](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/storm-steering-jet-stream-could-shift-poleward-in-40-years/)\n\nHeat domes which now plague states such as Texas may become annual characteristics of weather in Ohio, especially more southern Ohio, not only with more southern latitudes but also devoid of the cooling impact of the Great Lakes, especially Lake Erie.",

        "MRpolo13 is correct, old iron furnaces and steel mills needed power (from water) and they still needs lots of water itself, but there is also more to it.  Raw material production of most kinds produces a lot of waste, and production of metal from ore is the same.  In *modern* steelmaking, about 1/2 of slag is produced for every 1 ton of iron.  Modern industry tries to find a beneficial and moneymaking reuse for these materials, and modern slag is used for making cement, glass fibers, agricultural soil treatments, aggregate, and other things.  Most of it gets reused today.  But the ratio of slag to steel production was higher back then, and the reuse was limited.  High supply, low demand...an iron furnace could soon be drowning in its own slag if it were not dumped or dispersed far away from the mill.  Most larger towns had a mill of some kind, outside of town, and slag would be dumped around the mill for as long as possible.  It was also given away just to get rid of it, and was hauled away and used road and railroad base, it was used to fill in low areas for construction and development, it was just dumped down riverbanks and into stream beds and the ocean, and to make dikes and levees, and it was used as landfill to fill in ocean bays and the bays in the Great Lakes.  In 1969, Bethlehem Steel received permits from the US and local govt's to dump 1.5 MILLION TONS of slag per year into Lake Erie at their facility in Lackawanna NY.  A lot of that is still there, and there is a whole valley filled with it in Bethlehem, PA.  So - there was a lot of it produced, it got spread all over the place, and it is inorganic and doesn't degrade.  So we still have it scattered around.  Sorry if TLDR.",

It will add a significant amount of wetland on site that will minimize the quantity needed off site to achieve the water quality goals set out in the lake\u2019s TMDL. It does not block the work upstream that will be needed in addition to the work at the lake. And it shows the upstream communities like Edina and St. Louis park that Minneapolis is willing to do its part. Why should we expect them to make efforts if we will not?\n\nAnd I would ask you the same question I would of any golf supporter: if you want the water quality to improve what is your plan? Where would you restore or install wetlands to do that upstream? What evidence do you have that whatever location you have in mind would be a more effective spot than at Hiawatha, or be more politically feasible?\n\nAlso: how can you argue that it will not improve _trash_ pollution at the lake when currently there is a pipe that delivers enormous quantities of trash direct from the streets of our city to the lake, and with the plan there will be a sizable catchment area where this trash can settle, floc, and/or be filtered? How is that not a significant improvement?\n\nAnd regarding money: the site is within the Nokomis-Hiawatha Regional park and as such will qualify for regional park and water quality dollars from the Met Council and possibly the state. The cost will not be 100% on Minneapolis taxpayers, unlike the likely situation the next time the course floods.",

As is proper crop rotation, alt drainage strategies, and no and reduced tillage, and residue resupply.\n\nIn FACT, the recent euthropication problems in Lake Erie are do to so many Ohio farmers adopted no till ag.\n\nSee, in fresh water systems, Phosphorous is normally the limiting nutrient. (In salt water systems like the Gulf of Mexico, it's nitrogen). But phosphorous is normally spread as a solid, and it needs close soil contact to become fixed. But no till helps build up a layer of plant matter on the surface. This plant matter is generally great, supporting soil carbon, microbial and soil fauna, and helping retain moisture. But if the P fertilizer falls on it, it won't fix to the soil. Then rain can carry it down to water.\n\nSo wholesale promotion of no till without modifying P fertilization strategies caused the eutrophication. Spreading news of incorporation needs has helped reduce that algae problem in Erie while maintaining the benefits of no till farming (to soil carbon. Of course pesticide use generally goes way up in no till). \n\nPoint is: the extensions go fucking hard on no till, CC, carbon amendments, and high precision fertilizer application. All of this is regenerative ag, which usually an undefined term to mean \"whatever strategies I prefer\".",

So I started watching, and kept watching and watching, waiting for the part where they were actually in Toronto. Imagine my surprise when I finished part 3, and realized they were actually not in Toronto at all... \n\nI promised y'all some insider info on these episodes, so here it is. Starting with [Niagara Falls](\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/9ToqNrbT33XSPR9YA). The falls is located on the Niagara River, which runs between Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. The river splits in that region, creating two separate falls, one located on the American side, and one on the Canadian side. In the scene where the boys are looking at the falls through the viewer, they are only seeing the American side, which is a regularly shaped, straight falls. The place where they filmed the staring competition and other challenges is called [Queen Victoria Park ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dZYAgfS2DtLRYR7D9)  (RIP Queen Vicky), and then they went to see the American falls right across the street, at this [Niagara River Viewpoint](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bJ75tS38pvbkcK8P6). You can see a bit of the Canadian falls from there too, but this is really not the best spot for it. It's a shame that the staff didn't take them to [this spot](https://maps.app.goo.gl/iTL2Xdscu1m6ALvVA) further down on the fallsview trail (unless they did so off-camera), because as spectacular as the American falls is, the Canadian one is breath-taking. It is wider, taller, horseshoe shaped, and a larger volume of water flows through there. Anyway, they then went to the Korean restaurant, and then stopped to shop in Hamilton. I would assume that the lakefront cottage property they stayed at was somewhere in Hamilton as well, judging by the fact that their 2018 concert was in Hamilton and the shopping scenes we see are at a plaza in Hamilton. The store they went to shop for groceries at is called [FreshCo](https://freshco.com/), and the clothing store is called [Mark's Work Warehouse ](https://www.marks.com/). It is hilarious to me that they shopped for clothes at Mark's of all places, because as the name suggests, it's a specialty store where you can find work-specific clothes. For example, scrubs if you're in a medical profession, PVC overalls if you're fishing, etc. (Disappointed that Jin did not pick up the fishing overalls LOL). The Jacket Yoongi tried on was in the \"hunting and outdoor\" section and that's how we know this man can pull off literally any look. You may be wondering at this point how I know for sure that they were in Hamilton. The landmark giveaway is the restaurant in the back of the parking lot shot. [Fran's](https://www.fransrestaurant.com/about) is an iconic landmark 24hr diner in Ontario, and its logo is unmistakable. The franchise has always carried very few locations at a time, and around this time, the only location outside of Toronto was in Hamilton. It closed down the following year and it was a big deal when that happened.",

CNN, today.\n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2022/10/02/sport/ohio-fishing-tournament-cheating-scandal-trnd/index.html\n\nThere's something fishy going on in the competitive fishing world.\n\nThe would-be winners of almost $29,000 at an Ohio fishing tournament were disqualified on Friday, after it was discovered their fish were stuffed with lead weights and fish fillets.\n\nJason Fischer, director of the Lake Erie Walleye Trail tournament, told CNN he was immediately suspicious when one team's fish weighed almost twice what he expected they would at the Cleveland championship weigh-in.\n\nThe walleye in the bucket looked like they should each weigh around 4 pounds, but the total weight indicated they would have to be at least 7 pounds each, he said.\n\n[snip]\n\nThe moment when Fischer discovered the alleged cheating was documented in several now-viral videos posted on social media, showing Fischer, surrounded by competitors, slice open the fish with a knife and pull out what he said was a lead ball. Jacob Runyan, one member of the two-person team who allegedly cheated, stood by silently watching in one video Fischer shared with CNN.\n\n**********************\n\nTournaments like this are no joke.  The participants invest in their boats and equipment the same way competitive figure skaters invest in coaching and costumes. They get up at 4am and spend all day on the water, where luck is at least as great a factor as skill, and don\u2019t really know the outcome until they all regroup back on shore.  The guys (and it\u2019s almost all guys) are tired and cranky and tempers are short.  It\u2019s kind of funny to see this crowd calling for the cheaters\u2019 arrest over some fish, but the tournaments are worth so much money that it really is a serious business.",

I'm sure there's a lot of nuances to it but CCC was for young single men and the WPA was generally for older married men with children.\n\nFrom the Erie County Parks Master Plan:\n\nChestnut Ridge Park is one of the original Erie County \nParks, beginning its development in 1926. Much of the \npark construction was handled through the WPA work \nforce through the 1930s; this consisted of shelters, pump \nshelters, colony ovens, and pavilions. The most significant \nand prominent structure was and is the Casino, a stone \nbuilding sitting atop a hill overlooking the surrounding park \nand community. The original timber Casino was built in \n1925, and destroyed by fire in 1932. The present day stone \nCasino was completed in 1938 by nearly 50 employees of \nthe WPA. The use of stone in the construction of the park \nduring the days of the WPA provided its structures with a \nrustic feel. The flagstone area behind the building allows \npark users to gaze upon marvelous views out towards \nBuffalo and even far out beyond Lake Erie to Canada. \nThe design of bridges and cabins blended into the \nnatural beauty of the park and 3.5 miles of roads were \nconstructed to allow access to the natural areas of the \npark. The diversified forest provides many habitats to \nwildlife and opportunities for relief from urban living.\n\n[Plan](https://www3.erie.gov/environment/2018-parks-master-plan-update)",

        "I was born and raised in NE Ohio, but live in Europe now... if I had to go back (and assuming you want to stay in the US too), I would choose northern Michigan over Ohio for a collapse situation. Although Ohio has a lot of natural resources, foraging/growing potential and ample freshwater from Lake Erie and rivers, northern Michigan has even more of all of that but with a much lower population density. Still enough population to form mutual aid networks, but not so much that things might get violent and hostile between major population centers in a collapse. The coastal area around Lake Erie in Ohio is heavily populated, to the point where I would be wary of SHTF situations happening the minute people start panicking.  \nI'm anticipating access to freshwater being one of the top concerns in a future collapse + climate change situation, and northern Michigan is fully surrounded by two huge Great Lakes (Michigan and Huron) both of which have better water quality than Erie.

During his first successful campaign, he colluded with North Vietnamese leadership to extend an unpopular war and hang it on his opponent.

They include protecting Lake Erie and how to spend the state\u2019s pool of American Rescue Act funding.\n\nMs. Larson, a social worker from Sylvania, said that she feels the outcome of the election will determine \u201cwhether we have more or less freedom when it's over.\u201d She added that the work she has done through 40 years in the field has allowed her to help \u201cthousands\u201d of people during her career.\n\nMr. Williams, a criminal defense attorney and Oregon resident, said in his opening statement that he wants to \u201cmake it easier for every single motivated Ohioan to dig themselves out of the circumstances and grow to their true potential.\u201d\n\nHe described his own story of going from a high school dropout and being disabled from a work accident to becoming a college graduate and a practicing attorney.\n\nThe 41st House District was put in place as a part of the state\u2019s recent redistricting process. It stretches from Richfield Township to Jerusalem Township, encompassing Sylvania, Oregon, and parts of North Toledo, including Point Place, along the way.\n\nWhitmer High School is not in the candidates\u2019 district, but part of Washington Local School District is in the district. Both candidates addressed how they want to lower crime in the community in the wake of Friday\u2019s shooting outside a football game at Whitmer. Three people were wounded. \n\nMs. Larson argued for more \u201csensible\u201d gun laws and a focus on funding for afterschool programs and community policing.\n\nMr. Williams said that the solution lies within ensuring that the state \u201cproperly funds the police\u201d and considering stricter penalties for violent offenders. They include a \u201c10-year minimum\u201d gun specification \u201cfor the use of guns in violent crimes.\u201d\n\nOn the issue of police reform, both candidates agreed that qualified immunity should be removed. Qualified immunity is when officers are \u201cimmune from civil liability when they act outside the bounds of their authority,\u201d Mr. Williams said.\n\nWhen the topic of abortion was addressed, the candidates differed greatly. Ms. Larson said that she wants to return to the abortion protections that were allowed by Roe vs. Wade.\n\nMr. Williams argued that the GOP-backed \u201cheartbeat bill\u201d would still allow for abortions for up to six weeks. He added that he would support abortion exceptions for pregnancies that threaten the life of the mother.\n\nOhio has to find a way to spend more than $5 billion in American Rescue Plan Act funding for continued recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. Both candidates hope to find a way to maximize northwest Ohio\u2019s share of that fund, if elected.\n\nMr. Williams said that he wants to see the money go toward \u201cjob creation and workforce development,\u201d and an expansion of job training programs. Ms. Larson wants to see more funding for the University of Toledo, establishing a community college in downtown Toledo, and investing further in clean energy development.\n\nDuring the hour-long debate, the pair also sparred over how to best protect one of the region's most important natural resources in Lake Erie. Both have differences in what they believe is the root cause of what pollutes the lake.\n\nMs. Larson said that the state needs to stop permitting \u201cconcentrated animal farms\u201d and look into disbanding existing farms that dump waste into Lake Erie.\n\n\u201cThe land can handle so much waste, and it needs to be farmed appropriately,\u201d she said.\n\nMr. Williams believes that the problem lies within municipalities not being held accountable for dumping their wastewater into the lake.\n\n\u201cThe solution is not to ban pigs,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cIt's about how we hold cities accountable for the untreated sewage their dumping into our rivers and lakes.\u201d\n\nIn closing statements, Ms. Larson said that she believes that she is \u201con the side of democracy\u201d in her positions.\n\n\u201cSometimes leaders do what they know is the right thing to do, even if others don\u2019t yet see it,\u201d she said. \u201cMost of the time though, leaders can and should listen to the will of the people because it's a reliable guide to what will turn out best for all of us. I have the work experience, the wisdom, and the empathy to do this job in that way.\u201d\n\nMr. Williams believes that his personal experience makes him a candidate who can bring about unique solutions for the district and the state.\n\n\u201cThe solution is not just to have empathy for everyone because of their life experiences,\u201d he said in his closing statement. \u201cIt\u2019s using your life experience to help guide Ohioans to a better future.\u201d\n\nEarly voting for the general election started Wednesday. Election Day is Nov. 8.",

        "In Torre's book he wrote with Tom Verducci, they wrote that the midge incident was the confluence of a bunch of seemingly unrelated events: like the clean up of Lake Erie making it more hospitable to insects, and then pushing the game back to accommodate another event or something like that.  The time of night and the bright lights of the stadium attracted the midges to the playing field.\n\nEdit: I just grabbed my copy of the book\n\nVerducci writes that midges had disappeared from the polluted Lake Erie, but after extensive clean up efforts there and in the Cuyahoga River, they began to return.  Midges only really swarm a few days a year in early May - June, but October 5th 2007 was unusually warm in Cleveland, so that triggered another swarm.  They gathered around the artificial light of the stadium, and descended on the playing field.  The play time of the game was adjusted to accommodate the Red Sox/Angels game, and that ended up putting the 8th inning of Game 2 right smack in the middle of the swarm.\n\nSo yeah, environmental cleanup, an 81-degree night in October, and some schedule shuffling landed the Yankees in the middle of a swarm of bugs.",

        "# Leftist perspective\n\nLeftists want our economy to explicitly serve the people in our society and to be deliberately engineered to improve people's outcomes and freedoms.\n\nVoting Republican will destroy the fragile web of regulations that prevent things from getting much worse fast. For just one example, the EPA was created after unrestrained capitalism regularly set fire to major rivers and Lake Erie. [Trump tried to gut it.](https://theweek.com/articles/816875/how-trump-redefining-epa)\n\nLeftists generally want everyone to have a baseline guaranteed quality of life. Republicans since Reagan [have worked to remove or limit welfare programs.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1984/07/29/reagan-welfare-cuts-found-to-worsen-families-poverty/077278f9-a875-4791-9c34-d1cf3cd148b5/) Welfare programs are no more than gauze on an arterial bleed, but they're better than nothing.\n\nDemocrats, however, are often in favor of maintaining, or occasionally improving, these inadequate bandage policies. Voting Democrat is a matter of harm reduction. It's nowhere near all that leftists want to do, but if voting doesn't require obscene amounts of effort, it's pretty effective at slowing the rate of going-to-hell.\n\nHowever, Democrats cannot be trusted to enact a leftist agenda, or even make a token gesture toward leftism.\n\n# Liberal perspective\n\nEconomically, a liberal is someone who supports capitalism. Socially, a liberal is someone who supports people doing what they want with their lives.\n\nFrom the economic perspective, you might vote Democrat because the businesses you support aren't negatively impacted by current and likely future regulations, at least not more than they're helped. Those who take a broader view of the economy would generally agree that, for instance, forbidding people from dumping used motor oil into the Ohio River is a bit of a burden on those who need to dump used motor oil, but it's more than offset by having the Ohio River not catch fire every year.\n\nYou might also vote Democrat because you think a few people temporarily need assistance when they're down on their luck, but most everyone can and should participate in capitalism, and that should be the goal of assistance programs.\n\nYou could also vote Democrat because, while you prefer further right economic policies, you are against bigotry and think the government has a place in protecting against it, like with affirmative action \u2014 or at least that it should abstain from enforcing it, such as with transgender healthcare bans. Or because you believe that people should not be forced to give up their health due to pregnancy and should be able to obtain an abortion.\n\nYou might also vote Democrat because the only other viable alternative is a Republican and that Republican is a child rapist or the like. This has happened in some elections. Democrats are generally quick to remove or disavow politicians who have been credibly accused of serious misconduct, but Republicans seem unmoved by such accusations.\n\n# Right-wing perspective\n\nTechnically, this is the *further* right wing perspective economically.\n\nYou might vote Republican because you view taxes and government programs as an imposition on your freedom. Government, you say, should exist for a minimal set of purposes, and it's taken on a large set of other responsibilities that should instead exist as different kinds of entity. This is an economically libertarian view.\n\nYou might also vote Republican because of bigotry. Republicans want to dismantle affirmative action and marriage equality. They support religious organizations being used for things like adoption and supporting homeless people, even when these religious organizations discriminate against people on the basis of religion or sexuality or the like. They have been legislating against transgender rights such as getting gender-affirming healthcare. They're keen on enacting laws to ban single digit numbers of trans children from participating in middle and high school sports. They use openly racist rhetoric, like strongly implying that Mexican immigrants are rapists and murderers.\n\nOr you might like the strong man rhetoric that Republicans use.",

        "This is from ohiodnr website:\n\nNUISANCE SPECIES: MUTE SWANS\n\nMute swans are commonly seen on large public lakes and are widespread throughout Ohio. They are considered a non-native invasive species in the United States and are becoming a nuisance here in Ohio. There are three species of swans that can be found in Ohio: The native trumpeter swan, tundra swan (or whistling swan, which only migrates through Ohio) and the mute swan. Mute swans will outcompete with the threatened trumpeter swan on Lake Erie marshes and other locations for nesting habitat.\n\nDuring the breeding and nesting season, which generally runs March through May, adult mute swans become highly territorial and will fight to push native birds out of their nesting area. Mute swans have been known to attack humans and pets during this time as well. This aggressive behavior also occurs after the young, called cygnets, hatch out. On public lakes, people who use jet-skis and kayaks tend to get flogged by swans if they get too close to their nest or young. The adult male will fly after what they see as a predator to chase it away and use their wings to attack. They have been known to drown people on rare occasions.   \n\nAn adult male swan can weigh up to twenty-six pounds and stand as tall as five feet. Mute swans can consume up to eight pounds of submerged aquatic vegetation in one day. They uproot the whole plant usually leaving nothing behind. This takes away natural habitat from fish and leaves little food source for native waterfowl. The removal of aquatic vegetation can also cause water quality issues and erosion problems. \n\nThe Division of Wildlife controls mute swans on public lands by utilizing egg addling to cut back on production and by physical removal of adult birds. Occasionally, complaints are received from homeowners who surround public lakes when mute swans are being aggressive. Removal of the bird is the action taken when human safety is a factor.  \n\nContrary to what most people believe, mute swans will nest next to Canada geese. Homeowner associations or golf courses will purchase swans for goose control. Ultimately the swans will eventually become a problem for the homeowners around the ponds because of aggression issues and removal is warranted. We encourage private landowners who chose to have mute swans to keep them controlled. The ways to control them is to only purchase one swan or two of the same sex and keep their wings clipped or pinioned. This will keep the swan on the owner\u2019s property. Landowners can also addle the eggs so cygnets do not hatch out. If the young are going to be allowed to hatch out, their wings need to be clipped or pinioned as well so they cannot leave the property. Division staff will assist private landowners who ask for removal of mutes by giving technical assistance or removing the swans depending on site-specific circumstances.",

Cleveland can have a claim to being a pretty dope town with the rock and roll hall of fame and the sports franchises but our ancestors have decided that the health of our state citizens and all the land didn\u2019t matter and used the watersheds as their industrial toilet. We\u2019ve had a river so polluted it caught on fire.

They\u2019re not wrong, Ohio sucks. Unfortunately Ohio could be pretty fucking cool, had it not been completely ruined by corrupt politics over the last 140 yrs or so.

We'd have a more progressive tax system. Cities wouldn't get ignored. We'd prioritize developing our clean energy industries. We'd finally get a constitutional school funding system, which Republicans have refused to do for over two decades. We'd stop diverting money from public schools to charter and religious private schools. Lake Erie and the Ohio River would be cleaner, along with the air we breathe.

Recent\ndata show a pathogen impairment throughout the watershed, as well.\n\n&gt;In 2004, the Regional Water Board adopted a Sediment TMDL Implementation Policy\n(Resolution Rl-2004-0087), which states that Regional Water Board staff shall\ncontrol sediment pollution by using existing permitting and enforcement tools.  The\ngoals of the Policy are to control sediment waste discharges to impaired water bodies\nso that the TMDLs are met, sediment water quality objectives are attained, and\nbeneficial uses are no longer impaired by sediment.\n\n&gt; Sediment\nconditions interact with water in many ways that can affect water temperatures.\nTherefore, practices implemented to prevent and minimize elevated sediment\ndischarges may also help control elevated water temperatures.\n\n&gt;potential discharges of treated wastewater\n\n&gt;During the PHI, RWB staff observed a road fill failure and associated debris slide. The\nfailure occurred on a permanent road constructed on an ~85% slope above a Class III\nwatercourse, extending about seven feet into the old road prism and narrowing the road\nto less than seven feet in width. The failure is approximately 75 feet wide, 40 feet long\nand 4 to 8 feet deep (Fig 1.) Sediment and debris from the failure entered the Class III\nwatercourse at the foot of the slope,\n\n&gt; All of these sites and other sites throughout the plan area were littered with\ntrash, some of which may contain toxic substances. RWB staff observed one small (~5\ngallon) tank of refrigerant and numerous camping gas tanks. Several of these sites were\nsituated in the channels of Class II and III watercourses.\n\n&gt;There are two potential issues of concern with respect to\nthe irrigation lines; one is the potential for impacts to slope stability by removal of trees\non saturated vulnerable ground and the other is impacts to the districts disposal process\nif a line is damaged.\n\n&gt;During the first review process, CDFW brought to attention discrepancies in Section II, Item 32(a) of the\nTHP regarding northern spotted owl protections. The habitat definitions and retention standards\ndescribed appeared to be from Attachment B instead of Attachment A, which contains the take\navoidance measures for northern spotted owls in the coast forest district. In the RPF response to first\nreview, the definitions and retention standards were not corrected, and Attachment B was referenced\nnear the beginning of Item 32 within the northern spotted owl protections.\nCDFW recommends in Section II, Item 32(a), the protection measures for NSO be revised to reflect the\ndefinitions and retention standards for Attachment A, the November 1,2019 revision. Justification: The\ntake avoidance measures should reference the appropriate ecotype, allowing the review team to\nevaluate the proposed measures for NSO take avoidance.\n\n&gt;During the first review process and through a Northern Spotted Owl (NSO) consultation, CDFW brought\nto attention concerns with the timing and stations of the NSO surveys that may affect the quality of the\nsurvey data, resulting in a possible false negative finding. The RPF agreed to supplement the survey effort with three additional surveys in 2020 conducted as close as possible to the crepuscular hours and\none additional thorough Stand Search of the THP area. Efforts to obtain NSO survey information from\npast THPs on the property were ongoing at the time of the PHI, and the RPF was able to provide eight\nyears of NSO survey data from a neighboring NTMP during first review. The additional survey efforts\nand any past survey data will allow CDFW to make a higher confidence determination regarding take\navoidance\n\n\n&gt;Page 79, #6 states \u201cFor NSO AC\u2019s where fledgling status has been determined (either nest failure\nor fledglings have left the core area).\u201d How will you determine that fledglings have left the core\narea?

At least 40 people have been discovered to have died due to this storm so far.  \n\nSecond, Buffalo sits at the eastern edge of Lake Erie and is right in the path of what's called [a lake-effect snow band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake-effect_snow?wprov=sfla1). \n\nLong story short, when the cold, dry wind blows across the still relatively warm lake water, water is sucked up into the atmosphere like a sponge. When the wind then blows across the higher elevations in the Buffalo region, the moisture is essentially squeezed out as a metric shit ton of snow. \n\nOur main respite from lake-effect snow comes in the form of Lake Erie eventually freezing over towards the middle to end of the winter. Since winters are becoming generally milder due to climate change, we're not getting that freezing. \n\nSo not only is Trump generally a moron about most stuff, but he's also wrong about this.

Of the coastal areas at least.  The he lake effect snow is also a thing, my city is south of Lake Erie so the west to east snow-dump isnt as bad where I am.  I also know that industrial and agricultural pollution has had and is having a huge effect on the lakes.  Both of those things are also drivers of climate change.  So if industry (like automotive) and farming haven\u2019t changed the global climate far enough to affect the Midwest, I believe the Midwest is also being affected locally as a source. \nThat idea might be too out there, but I think there have been more drastic temp changes in recent years.

        "\u201cTypically, a helium-filled latex balloon that is released outdoors will stay aloft long enough to be fully deflated before it descends to Earth.[8] However, the Balloonfest balloons collided with a front of cool air and rain, which caused them to drop towards the ground while still inflated. The descending balloons clogged the land and waterways of Northeast Ohio. In the days following the event, many balloons were reported washed ashore on the Canadian side of Lake Erie causing water pollution.[6] Some people had misconceptions about the environmental impact of balloon releases, thinking that \"the balloons would reach an altitude where they popped and disintegrated.\"[7]. \n  \n  Burke Lakefront Airport had to shut down a runway for half an hour after balloons landed there.[1][3] Traffic collisions were also reported \"as drivers swerved to avoid slow motion blizzards of multicolored orbs or took their eyes off the road to gawk at the overhead spectacle\".[3] Motorists on the Cleveland Memorial Shoreway ran into fences and each other before the roadway was shut down. A bulldozer was needed to help clear away the balloons.[7]. \n  \n  Two fishermen, Raymond Broderick and Bernard Sulzer, who had gone out on September 26, were reported missing by their families on the day of the event. Rescuers spotted their 16-foot (4.9 m) boat anchored west of the Edgewater Park breakwall. A Coast Guard search and rescue helicopter crew had difficulties reaching the area because of the \"asteroid field\" of balloons.[9] A search-and-rescue boat crew tried to spot the fishermen floating in the lake, but Guard officials said balloons in the water made it impossible to see whether anyone was in the lake.[1] On September 29, the Coast Guard suspended its search. The fishermen's bodies subsequently washed ashore. The wife of one of the fishermen sued the United Way of Cleveland and the company that organized the balloon release for $3.2 million and later settled on undisclosed terms.[1]\n\nBalloons landing on a pasture in Medina County, Ohio, spooked Louise Nowakowski's Arabian horses, which allegedly suffered permanent injuries as a result. Nowakowski sued the United Way of Cleveland for $100,000 in damages and settled for undisclosed terms.[1]\n\nThe fundraiser lost money due to cost overruns.[5]\u201d \n\n[Source](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloonfest_'86)",

        "\u201cTypically, a helium-filled latex balloon that is released outdoors will stay aloft long enough to be fully deflated before it descends to Earth.[8] However, the Balloonfest balloons collided with a front of cool air and rain, which caused them to drop towards the ground while still inflated. The descending balloons clogged the land and waterways of Northeast Ohio. In the days following the event, many balloons were reported washed ashore on the Canadian side of Lake Erie causing water pollution.[6] Some people had misconceptions about the environmental impact of balloon releases, thinking that \"the balloons would reach an altitude where they popped and disintegrated.\"[7].\n\nBurke Lakefront Airport had to shut down a runway for half an hour after balloons landed there.[1][3] Traffic collisions were also reported \"as drivers swerved to avoid slow motion blizzards of multicolored orbs or took their eyes off the road to gawk at the overhead spectacle\".[3] Motorists on the Cleveland Memorial Shoreway ran into fences and each other before the roadway was shut down. A bulldozer was needed to help clear away the balloons.[7].\n\nTwo fishermen, Raymond Broderick and Bernard Sulzer, who had gone out on September 26, were reported missing by their families on the day of the event. Rescuers spotted their 16-foot (4.9 m) boat anchored west of the Edgewater Park breakwall. A Coast Guard search and rescue helicopter crew had difficulties reaching the area because of the \"asteroid field\" of balloons.[9] A search-and-rescue boat crew tried to spot the fishermen floating in the lake, but Guard officials said balloons in the water made it impossible to see whether anyone was in the lake.[1] On September 29, the Coast Guard suspended its search. The fishermen's bodies subsequently washed ashore. The wife of one of the fishermen sued the United Way of Cleveland and the company that organized the balloon release for $3.2 million and later settled on undisclosed terms.[1]\n\nBalloons landing on a pasture in Medina County, Ohio, spooked Louise Nowakowski's Arabian horses, which allegedly suffered permanent injuries as a result. Nowakowski sued the United Way of Cleveland for $100,000 in damages and settled for undisclosed terms.[1]\n\nThe fundraiser lost money due to cost overruns.[5]\u201d\n\n^^^ from the og post",

        "The problem is there are too many products to continually research. I don't want to have to background check the ethical practices of every company that I purchase anything from. And neither does anybody else.\n\nEconomic conservatives continually make the same mistake - they focus on individual behavior as if telling everyone to be better can solve any of these problems. It can't. In a global economy, individual consumers have no power to force changes on companies through their purchasing decisions.\n\nThe reason regulations exist is because it's simply not possible with the limited time that we all have to keep companies honest, and to expect that the honest ones are going to have any sort of advantage in a marketplace that is too overflowing with information and misinformation for the consumer to make informed decisions on every good they purchase.\n\nUltimately, whether or not I shop at Amazon makes zero difference towards the company's bottom line. Everybody else knows the same thing, and so in the aggregate there's no way to change them. We know this, because the fact that individuals will act in their own self-interest is a foundational principle of free market economics.\n\nRegulations allow both businesses and consumers to make better ethnical choices. Again, we know this is true based on generations of empirical evidence - just look at Lake Erie, and the impact that EPA regulations had on it even within a 20-year time span starting in the '70s.\n\nWe don't breathe smog-filled air because of pollution controls. The hole in the ozone layer is gone because of CFC regulations. Kids aren't eating leaded paint chips or breathing leaded gasoline fumes, because of lead regulations. Vehicle fatalities have dropped tremendously since the 1970s because of vehicle safety regulations.\n\nThe idea that the market freedoms allow for the best possible results for society is nothing more than pure brainwashing propaganda by pro-business forces. Does it make for a slightly more efficient economy? Perhaps. But that's not worth the health, safety, and happiness trade-offs that come with it.",

Lake Erie surpasses all the other Great Lakes in the amount of effluent received from sewage treatment plants and is also most subjected to sediment loading due to the nature of the underlying geology and land use. Exposed agricultural and urban lands, particularly in southwest Ontario and northwest Ohio, contribute immense sediment loads to the lake.\n\nIn particular, one of the worst sources of the phosphorus that feeds the toxic algae is the [Maumee river watershed](https://news.umich.edu/lake-erie-phosphorus-reduction-targets-challenging-but-achievable/).\n\n&gt;The main driver of the harmful algal blooms is elevated phosphorus from watersheds draining to Lake Erie\u2019s western basin, particularly from the heavily agricultural Maumee River watershed.

        "I'm sorry, but you are either incredibly naive or ignorant on the subject. \n\nIf you are interested in the situation here are some snippets for this article: https://www.greatlakesnow.org/2020/09/drinking-unsafe-water-contaminants-solutions/ \n\n\"Seth Siegel, author of Troubled Water: What\u2019s Wrong With What We Drink, underscores the evolution over time in contamination concerns, from the biological to the chemical. \u201cA dab of chlorine might address microorganisms, but it does nothing about these synthetics,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are ingesting, in micro quantities, a cocktail of chemicals all the time.\u201d\n\n\nThe Clean Water Act, in theory, regulates discharges into U.S. waters and therefore protects sources of drinking water. However, this year the Trump administration issued a new regulation, the Navigable Waters Protection Rule, that narrows the scope of the Clean Water Act by revoking federal protections for millions of miles of streams and millions of acres of wetlands. The NRDC and other environmental groups have filed a lawsuit to stop the decision.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t have a strong Clean Water Act, we\u2019ll never have clean drinking water,\u201d says Lynn Thorp, national campaigns director for the nonprofit Clean Water Action. \u201cWe need to put equal effort upstream.\u201d\n\n\n\nOutdated standards\nEven when the law is enforced, advocates lament that the standards used are often outdated. The current federal drinking water standard for nitrate, for example, went into effect in 1992 at 10 parts per million. Yet research has found that levels less than one-tenth of that legal limit may raise the risk of cancer and other health issues. In early 2019, the EPA suspended plans to reevaluate the nitrate standard.\n\nThe EPA did propose an update in October 2019 to its rules on lead and copper, which had not been touched since 1991. Meanwhile, the House of Representatives approved new legislation this past July that authorizes US$22.5 billion to replace a portion of the country\u2019s estimated 6 to 10 million lead service lines that remain, connecting water mains to homes in Flint, Newark and elsewhere. Kail says that AWWA supports the revision. \u201cAs long as there is lead in contact with the water, some level of risk remains,\u201d he says. \u201cSo the best cure is to get the lead out.\u201d\n\nAdvocates argue the rules still won\u2019t go far enough or come fast enough. And they suggest the same generally holds for the EPA\u2019s actions or inactions on drinking water quality. Of most concern, they say, are the potentially hazardous contaminants that still lack a standard. \u201cThe law really is broken and needs to be fixed if it is going to protect the public,\u201d says Olson.\n\nThe EPA\u2019s current process for developing new standards, defined in the 1996 amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act, needs to be sped up and strengthened, he and other advocates say. The EPA\u2019s Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule (UCMR) allows the EPA to select up to 30 unregulated pathogens and pollutants to be monitored every five years. Public drinking water systems serving at least 10,000 people, along with a representative sample of smaller systems, must periodically test for these contaminants. The agency uses the data in considering future drinking water standards.\n\nSo far, the only new chemical that the agency has come close to regulating through the process is perchlorate, a component of rocket fuel, munitions and fireworks. Studies suggest that exposure may derail brain development of fetuses and infants. The EPA determined in 2011 that the contaminant required regulation. But this June, the agency reversed course and announced that, taking into consideration \u201cthe best available science and the proactive steps that EPA, states and public water systems have taken to reduce perchlorate levels,\u201d it would not regulate perchlorate. That decision is now in litigation. \u201cThe EPA just hasn\u2019t had the spine to issue any regulations off the contaminant candidate list,\u201d says Olson.\n\nSix perfluorinated chemicals were monitored via the UCMR between 2013 and 2015. This past February, the EPA announced preliminary regulatory determinations and opened up comments for two of those chemicals, PFOA and PFOS. Meanwhile, several states, including New Jersey and New Hampshire, have moved ahead with their own regulations, some of which go beyond PFOA and PFOS \u2014 the legacy PFAS compounds that are already being phased out \u2014 to include more of the potentially thousands of extremely persistent synthetic chemicals that belong to the same class.\n\n\nPathogens and pesticides\nPathogens remain a serious issue, too. E. coli in drinking water has caused deadly outbreaks. Norovirus, Giardia and cryptosporidium have also contaminated drinking water supplies in recent years. But the pathogens perhaps highest on the minds of experts today are those that grow in pipes.\n\nLegionella, the bacterium that causes Legionnaires\u2019 disease, a type of pneumonia, offers a critical case in point. It poses a microbiological threat with widespread consequences. In Flint, the same issue that caused the release of lead into the drinking water also resulted in deadly cases of Legionnaires\u2019 disease in the surrounding community. Repeated outbreaks at a Quincy, Illinois, veterans home have killed more than a dozen people since 2015. And, in May 2019, a custodian died from Legionnaires\u2019 disease after being infected at Kettering Fairmont High School in Kettering, Ohio. The school\u2019s water tested positive for Legionella this July, and a current custodian has tested positive for the disease. Spokespeople with the Illinois veterans home and the Ohio high school note that measures have been taken to reduce the risk of further infections.\n\nAgricultural practices remain implicated in much of the nation\u2019s tainted drinking water. Studies have shown that pesticides pose a serious threat. For example, atrazine has been associated with low birth weight in babies.\n\n\u201cEvery spring in the Midwest, a pulse of atrazine comes off the fields. Tough luck on you if you happen to be carrying a child during that period,\u201d says Sedlak, noting that regulatory standards might still be met because EPA regulations average numbers over the course of an entire year.\n\nNeonicotinoids are another example. \u201cNeonics are wonderful [from a human health perspective] because they target receptors specific to insects,\u201d Sedlak says. \u201cBut, after a chemical reaction with chlorine, the product is something that is likely to target people.\u201d Limited data hints at potential health effects ranging from respiratory, cardiovascular and neurological issues to birth defects.\n\nExcess fertilizer applications on farms also trigger major algal blooms that can contaminate drinking water. Toxins produced by blue-green algae (also known as cyanobacteria) in Lake Erie fed by runoff from farms in the watershed contaminated the Toledo, Ohio, drinking water system in the summer of 2014. Almost half a million people were told to avoid drinking, bathing or cooking with their tap water for a couple of days; 110 people got sick. It was neither the first nor the last time that such toxins threatened public health. Residents of Carroll Township, Ohio, received a similar warning in September 2013. And in July 2018, authorities in Salem, Oregon, advised children and the elderly not to drink the city\u2019s water.",
